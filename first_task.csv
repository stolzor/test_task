Energy Efficiency Day 2022 Is Just Two Weeks Away;"The seventh annual Energy Efficiency Day is rapidly approaching! Join us in celebrating the multiple benefits of energy efficiency—the least expensive, fastest way to meet our energy needs, reduce consumer bills, and cut pollution—on Wednesday, October 5.
Energy Efficiency Day is a nationwide awareness event. There are many ways you can get involved, from posting on social media about the benefits of efficiency to using energy efficiency technologies to cut down on energy waste at home.
Energy efficiency is in the spotlight now. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act includes the largest combined investments in energy efficiency in U.S. history. These investments can help save money for American consumers and businesses, improve public health, and grow the energy efficiency and clean energy industries.
Getting your community to recognize the benefits of energy efficiency is critical. Already, communities across the nation, including Colorado Springs, Colorado; Fayetteville, Arkansas; and Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, are issuing proclamations showing their commitment to using energy more efficiently.
With energy costs expected to rise this winter, efficiency must be a priority. That’s why it’s a great time for your city, county, or state to issue a proclamation in support of Energy Efficiency Day. By doing so, your community can demonstrate its leadership in supporting a clean, affordable, and prosperous future. And by using the Energy Efficiency Day proclamations toolkit, it’s easy to reach out to your local officials to ask them to participate! Last year, nearly 70 state, county, and city governments—along with the U.S. Senate and numerous universities—issued proclamations for Energy Efficiency Day.
Energy Efficiency Day’s supporters are growing in number every day. You can join us on October 5 as we work to save money, cut pollution, and create jobs! We look forward to celebrating with you.

These ACEEE Staff Love Their Heat Pumps: Here’s Why;"If you know ACEEE, you know we champion heat pumps because they are a highly efficient way to heat and cool homes and other buildings. But we don’t just write reports about them; more and more of us are using them in our own homes.
Below, several staff share their personal experiences installing, using, and repairing different types of heat pumps. We are homeowners and renters; we live in apartments, condos, and single-family houses in different climates. But we’re all happy with our heat pumps (and have learned a lot along the way).
  Wendy Koch, Senior Director of Marketing and Communications
""Nearly as soon as my husband and I bought a tiny 1922 single-family home last year in Alameda, California, the furnace died. It was October, and winter was coming. As an electric heat pump fan, I knew what we wanted. The hard part was getting it. Thanks to supply chain problems, the inventory for heat pumps was very low, so companies kept trying to sell us gas furnaces. 
I insisted on bids for heat pumps. In our case, mini-splits would have cost several thousand dollars more than a ducted system and required wall repair. Because the house already had vents, we opted for a ducted air-source system, which can be slightly less energy efficient but allows for a whole-house air filtration system. We couldn't find an ENERGY STAR®-certified unit, unfortunately, and settled for a fairly efficient one. Like us, many homeowners don’t replace their HVAC until it dies, often leaving them too little time to find the best model and price.
One big plus of the system: the house didn’t have air-conditioning before, but now it does.""
  Aimee Bell-Pasht, Federal Policy Senior Research Analyst
""I rent a two-bedroom apartment in New York City, on the top floor of a brownstone. We have a ductless mini-split system with two indoor units (a smaller one in the bedroom and a larger one in the living room). We also have natural gas heating.
We moved in in May, and as summer progressed, we figured that our heat pump wasn’t very good or wasn’t sized correctly (the apartment was cool-ish on the best of days but not great). Eventually it started to get too hot to work from home and we called the landlord, who luckily was responsive. It turns out that our unit was broken and had been leaking refrigerant!
After two full days of the maintenance workers trying to find what turned out to be a very small leak, they patched everything up and the unit works great. In fact, the apartment is a little too cold and I’m surprised at the temperature settings I end up using—I now set the units to about 74 to 76 degrees econo-cool.""
 ""This type of air-conditioning is really nice compared to using window units! Now our windows are unobstructed, and we don’t have to worry about lugging a window unit in and out of storage (or installing it safely). And the mini-splits are way more effective at cooling the space; it feels like central AC.""
  Lowell Ungar, Federal Policy Director
""I live in a cohousing condo in Washington, DC. We have a ducted ground-source heat pump and it works well. Fairly tight construction (which limits air leaks) also helps keep steady temperatures.
The heat pump does not need backup even on the coldest days in DC. And the energy bills are nice—my electricity bills top out at less than $60/month in the winter and usually are closer to $35. I would guess I pay less than $100 a year for heating and cooling (however, buying the system was expensive). It also helps that I have a “desuperheater,” which uses waste heat from the heat pump to preheat water for my water heater.
There are a couple challenges to be aware of: Our complex has small HVAC closets, so replacing the heat pumps has occasionally been difficult. More broadly, finding contractors who understand ground-source heat pumps has sometimes been an obstacle. Also, in a few units there were leaks in the underground pipes early on—we generally just abandoned those pipes and doubled up on others.""
  Mark Kresowik, Senior Director of Policy
""I live in a townhouse in Washington, DC. The home already had a ducted air-source heat pump system  when we bought it, but we have since replaced the system. When we did, we learned the duct work was the wrong size for the house and system, probably due to being designed for a gas system that was there before, and one contractor wouldn't replace it. Fortunately, we’ve had no significant issues since the replacement.
We now have no gas bills, and thanks to our solar panels, nearly no energy bill at all. So there’s no air pollution, and we have comfortable temperatures. What more could you want? 
My advice to the heat-pump curious is to plan ahead before you need to do an emergency replacement. It can be difficult to find a knowledgeable, available contractor who has equipment ready to go.""
  Jennifer Amann, Buildings Program Senior Fellow
""I live in an 1860s-era rowhouse in Baltimore that’s roughly 1,800 square feet. We are in the process of replacing our gas furnace, central AC, and associated ductwork—all installed by a previous owner—with a ductless heat pump system.
We’ve had a number of problems with the old system. Plus, I want to electrify and get off gas.
We’ve first made the house as efficient as it can be without replacing the HVAC. We did a whole-home retrofit through Home Performance with ENERGY STAR in 2012 to air seal and beef up insulation. We’ve also replaced all the windows and installed a cool roof. 
One reason it’s taken us so long to move forward on the HVAC is lots of deliberating (and many conflicting opinions from contractors) over whether to stick with a ducted system or move to ductless. The duct system in our home is undersized and doesn’t have sufficient return. Some rooms are over-conditioned, while others are under-conditioned. And the system can’t provide adequate heating and cooling to the one room on the third floor of the home (we installed a single mini-split heat pump in that room several years ago to make the space bearable).  
Rather than continuing to struggle with inadequate ductwork, we decided to move to a ductless system. We can take advantage of the very high system efficiency and have better control over the temperature in different parts of the house depending on who is occupying the space and at what time of day. Plus, removing the ductwork in the cellar has given us back our storage space!
We were able to take advantage of a utility rebate from Baltimore Gas and Electric and low-interest financing from the Maryland Clean Energy Advantage Loan program.""
Replacing a ducted HVAC system (left) with a ductless heat pump system allowed Amann to recover storage space (right).
Interested in heat pumps? Don’t get stuck in the cold (or heat): Plan ahead!
A common theme noted by ACEEE staff is the need to advocate for yourself with contractors, who may try to steer you toward a conventional furnace, especially if your HVAC has failed or is failing. Many replacements are done on an emergency basis, and people usually—and understandably—get a like-for-like replacement.
It can take time and research to find contractors who install heat pumps. If you think your HVAC system could fail in the near future, consider identifying qualified heat-pump contractors in your area ahead of time and discussing your heat pump options. When the time comes, you will be ready to upgrade!
 The new federal climate law will help make heat pumps more affordable:
Replacing an HVAC system can be prohibitively expensive. The good news is that the recently signed Inflation Reduction Act includes incentives to help low- and moderate-income households afford heat pumps. The following will be available starting January 1, 2023:
Purchasers of highly efficient heat pumps will qualify for a 30% tax credit up to $2,000 (this also applies for heat pump water heaters). For the remainder of this year only, it’s a $600 credit for ENERGY STAR heat pumps. The credit goes to the homeowner for their principal residence.
For ground-source heat pumps the credit also covers 30% of cost, but with no cap.
States will be starting rebate programs for low- and moderate-income households (up to 150% of area median income), which could provide point-of-sale rebates for up to 50% of cost with a cap of $8,000 for ENERGY STAR heat pumps (up to 80% of cost for households under 80% of the area median income).

Proposed Model Building Code Could Slash Energy Use in New Commercial Buildings;"A draft model energy code for commercial buildings released Tuesday could reduce net energy use in new buildings by a quarter, which would be a major step toward zero-net-energy and carbon-neutral new buildings. The proposed 2024 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) is now open for public comment through mid-October, giving stakeholders a brief window to advocate for a strong final version that can be adopted by states and cities around the country.
Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of U.S. energy consumption. Energy codes are one of the strongest tools for reducing energy use and emissions from new buildings. Strong energy codes are also essential for an equitable energy-efficient economy because they set a minimum standard that all buildings must meet, ensuring that no household or business in a new building is left with needlessly high energy bills.
The proposed 2024 IECC-Commercial model code would require buildings to be significantly more efficient than those adhering to the previous version, from 2021. It would save an estimated 8% to 12% energy from improved energy efficiency, reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions. ACEEE estimates the model code would result in an additional 10% to 12% net energy reduction from new on-site renewable energy requirements (with some exceptions that allow for off-site renewable energy procurement). New provisions that require flexible load management or even more renewable energy could produce an additional 7% energy cost savings. If approved, this would all add up to a major advance in energy codes.
The commercial building provisions of the IECC apply to all commercial buildings and multifamily buildings of four or more stories; an alternative model energy code, ASHRAE 90.1, can also be used to show compliance with the IECC. The IECC becomes effective in states and localities that adopt it, emphasizing the importance of implementation of the most recent version of the model codes. Thirty-two states have adopted some version of the IECC for commercial buildings, six states and D.C. have adopted ASHRAE 90.1 alone, two states (California and Washington) have their own energy code, and ten states have no statewide energy code.
What’s new in the draft code?
ACEEE and other energy efficiency advocates have worked hard to ensure a 2024 IECC that pushes for deep energy and emissions reductions while considering both upfront and energy costs, as well as the ability of jurisdictions to implement the new code. Among the most impactful proposed changes:
Expanded energy efficiency credits that give building developers the flexibility to select among several measures to meet a prescribed total number of credits required for each building type and climate zone. This framework also has the potential to deliver deeper energy savings over time.
Mandatory on-site renewable energy, such as from rooftop solar panels. Where on-site installations are limited by physical conditions, exceptions allow for the procurement of off-site renewable energy.
New requirements to achieve a prescribed number of ""Renewable and Load Management Credits"" through a combination of additional renewable energy and energy storage. These provisions are aimed at cost savings with the net energy impact dependent on the combination of measures a building developer selects.
New provisions to cut down on heat loss from thermal bridging (higher-conductivity materials passing through insulation layers) and to further reduce air leakage.
Reductions in lighting power allowances and new lighting control requirements (e.g., daylight dimming controls in many building areas, occupancy sensors in more spaces).
Occupancy sensor and control requirements to limit ventilation when certain building spaces are vacant, reducing energy usage for heating or cooling of outside air brought in for ventilation.
A new computer model-based compliance option that evaluates overall HVAC system efficiency instead of individual component efficiency. This provides flexibility to building developers in complying with the code, as well as an opportunity to significantly improve HVAC system efficiency where individual equipment improvement options may be limited.
A number of other proposals were also approved by the IECC Commercial Consensus Committee responsible for IECC development. The public can comment and suggest modifications to the draft (including entirely new provisions), but any changes would also require a two-thirds majority vote of the committee.
How did we get here?
The IECC is developed on a three-year cycle, and a new process adopted for the current cycle limits the influence of sustainability- and civic-minded state and local officials who have delivered major efficiency gains in recent code cycles. Amid this challenge, ACEEE and other advocates for energy efficiency and emissions reductions have worked to ensure the International Code Council—which runs the IECC development process—delivers on its promise to maximize energy efficiency that is “safe, technologically feasible, and life cycle cost effective.” ACEEE has been a voting member of the IECC Commercial Consensus Committee since the start of the current process in the fall of 2021.
There were some upsides to the new process, as proponents of code change proposals were able to work with committee members and other interested parties to improve their proposals, and working groups were established to address complex or related proposals. But given the time commitment required and the limited influence of those not on the committee, it remains to be seen whether the new process is a sustainable model to reach zero-net-energy and carbon-neutral new construction.
What should we do now?
The work is not done, and the time to have input in this process is now. The International Code Council is accepting public comments on the draft code through October 21. With strong energy efficiency and decarbonization gains in the proposed code, we can expect pushback. Supportive comments in the public review period can help ensure committee members stand firmly on the side of reducing energy costs and fighting climate change. The International Code Council is hosting a webinar on how to submit comments on Friday, September 9 at 11:00 am ET.
ACEEE will continue to work to improve the 2024 IECC during the public review period, advocating that the model code move away from fossil fuel-burning space heating and water heating, ensure all building envelopes meet minimum levels of performance, and increase energy efficiency while avoiding trade-offs with renewables.

Landmark U.S. Plan for Decarbonizing Industry Paves Path Ahead;"Washington, DC—In response to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) releasing an “Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap” report to Congress, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released the following statement from Ed Rightor, its industrial program director and co-chair of the team that developed the DOE report:
“Tackling greenhouse gas emissions from industry is going to require all hands pursuing a common plan. DOE’s landmark decarbonization roadmap will jumpstart this shared effort.
“The U.S. has supported research and development of clean industrial technologies for years, and while that remains critical, it’s not enough to meet the climate challenge. The plan released today from the Department of Energy embodies a bolder approach, where it will work with companies to demonstrate and deploy low-carbon industrial technologies to scale. It’s a more ambitious strategy, grounded in a cohesive approach incorporating partnership opportunities for industry to accelerate decarbonization.”

As EVs Surge, Utilities Need Transparent, Equitable, Comprehensive Plans to Support Them;"Electric vehicle registrations are up 60% this year, and over the last decade, regulators have approved more than $3 billion dollars in utility transportation electrification investments. Amid the surge in electric vehicles, ACEEE found utilities are supporting an increasingly wide range of electrification efforts, including investments in charging infrastructure for apartment building residents and vehicle fleets, as well as education and outreach efforts. Our report calls for utilities to engage in more transparent and comprehensive planning and to focus investments not just on personal passenger vehicles but also on transit fleets, heavier classes of vehicles, and rideshare vehicles—while centering equity to ensure underserved communities benefit from the transition to low-emission vehicles.
The acceleration of electric vehicle (EV) adoption is driven by declining battery prices and supportive policies at the state level. California plans to phase out internal combustion engine automobile sales by 2035, a policy expected to be adopted by other states. Another California regulation aims to electrify medium- and heavy-duty sector truck fleets.
EVs benefit drivers and society with lower costs and cleaner air. However, communities that are underserved by EV charging today must be supported so they can share in the benefits of EVs and not be left behind. Millions of new EVs on the road will mean greater demand for electricity charging infrastructure, making it essential for utilities to prepare for electrification. The level of planning and investment by utilities across the country varies significantly, but some trends are emerging.
ACEEE assessed transportation electrification (TE) planning efforts among 10 investor-owned utilities and one municipally owned utility, each chosen for having recently submitted plans and representing the range of utility involvement in TE. These 11 utilities varied in their level of TE planning and investment and hailed from a diverse set of states that are at different stages of the EV transition. ACEEE looked at both the content of TE plans and the underlying planning processes. We examined efforts across seven criteria: coverage of vehicle types and overall program scope, rates and managed charging, incentives, equity, education and marketing, metrics and progress reporting, and system planning.
Map of Utilities Evaluated and State EV investments
Data on approved EV investments by state from Atlas EV Hub (2022)
Emerging Trends
We found several emerging trends in infrastructure investments, non-infrastructure activities, and the inclusion of equity and education. Investments in L2 charging, typically providing 10 to 20 miles of range an hour and best suited for overnight charging, were more common than investments in direct current fast charging (DCFC), which can provide almost a full charge in under 30 minutes but entails higher upfront installation and infrastructure costs. Make-ready investments, in which the utility pays most or all of the costs to make a site ready for a charger to be installed by the site owner, were more common than utilities owning the charging infrastructure, including the charger itself.
Investments in charging infrastructure at apartment and condo buildings, which often present greater challenges and costs than charging at single-family homes, were also common. Many make-ready programs focused on apartment and condo buildings to ensure residents could take advantage of at-home charging, which is more convenient and generally cheaper than public charging.
A common investment outside of physical charging infrastructure was electric rates that prioritize charging when it is most opportune for the grid, often referred to as time-of-use (TOU) rates. These rates reduce the strain EVs can have on the electric grid and can even allow EVs to take advantage of times when the grid is not at full capacity or when there is abundant renewable energy generation. On a sunny day, or overnight when wind may be blowing the strongest, renewable generation will likely be at its peak and can even coincide with times when overall electricity demand is relatively low. Xcel Energy Colorado’s TOU program charges almost five times more per kilowatt-hour for charging during the peak summer hours of 9am to 9pm, when electricity demand is at its highest. Services to assess the costs and benefits of electrifying for fleet operators were also common among utility programs.
Equity and education to address inequities in past transportation investments were also common. Southern California Edison, for example, plans to dedicate 50% of its spending to disadvantaged communities and has reached out to these communities to prioritize public fast-charging investments. Other utilities have set aside funding for underserved communities, although criteria varied for which communities to include, and plans for community engagement were. More utilities had broad plans to educate the public about the benefits of EVs, including partnerships with auto dealerships, where many people may encounter EVs for the first time.
Ensuring Comprehensive Transportation Electrification Plans
After reviewing 11 utility TE plans, ACEEE recommends:
Utility planning efforts need to be more transparent and consistent to ensure accountability.
The planning process should be ongoing, ideally requiring a new plan every few years that gives updates on progress and allows for input from regulators and the public.
Planning efforts should cover all TE use cases including passenger vehicles, trucks and other heavier classes of vehicles, as well as transit, micro-mobility, and rideshare vehicles.
Equity must be included throughout to ensure that everyone benefits from the TE transition and that underserved communities are meaningfully engaged. This includes engaging early and often to assess these communities’ needs.
Utilities should develop metrics and goals related to infrastructure development while also considering a wide variety of outcomes related to greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, and equity.
We found that only seven states in the country require their utilities to submit comprehensive TE plans that put their TE strategy, programs, and impact in one document for public and regulatory scrutiny. Our evaluation included three such plans from the joint Arizona Public Service and Tucson Electric Power company filing, Puget Sound Energy in Washington State, and Xcel Energy in Colorado. These plans and planning processes are the most thorough and allow for optimal accountability and consistency. They generally also include a high level of detail about a utility’s TE strategy and plans for the short, medium, and long term.
Utility TE planning can take many forms, and approaches vary across the country, but we identified principles that regulators and utilities should adhere to as they develop their programming. The transition to electrified transportation will take decades, involve many stakeholders, and require significant investments in charging infrastructure and grid updates. Comprehensive planning by utilities can help ensure that TE investments serve different types of vehicles and deliver the greatest benefits, especially to underserved communities, while allowing for public input and participation.

Multimedia Project Highlights Efficiency's Essential Role in a Clean Energy Future;"Energy efficiency will receive its largest U.S. government investments ever from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022—a testament to efficiency’s essential and wide-ranging role in a clean energy future.
The sweeping bill, approved by Congress and signed into law this month, includes billions of dollars in funding to help people buy electric cars and make energy-saving home upgrades. It includes $3 billion for a Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant program to improve walkability and affordable transportation via measures such as new trails or bike lanes.
The law underscores efficiency’s value in building a dynamic, low-carbon economy.
Similarly, a new multimedia ACEEE project shows that energy efficiency—a remarkable success story of the past 40 years—will be just as important (if not more so) in the coming decades. It makes the case that efficiency will be essential for equitably addressing the climate crisis, even as more renewable energy enters the power grid and often grabs the spotlight.
    The StoryMap, released today, shows how energy efficiency has evolved. Yes, efficiency still means doing more with less or using less energy to get the same job done. Yet many people may not realize that efficiency now goes beyond a single product, vehicle, or building. It optimizes how we use energy throughout the economy, getting all parts to work better together—like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. 
This systems-wide version is not your grandparents' efficiency. It uses big data, advanced technology, and sophisticated design to optimize how we do things. For example, streamlined freight delivery routes minimize empty truck space and wasted miles, thereby requiring less fuel.
Today’s efficiency makes the transition to renewable power faster, easier, and more affordable. The reason is simple: the less electricity we use, the less we need to generate. And the emissions-free energy we do generate can power more homes, cars, and buildings, lowering costs.
ACEEE’s StoryMap shows all of us the value and urgency of investing in energy efficiency—the heart of our clean energy future.

Three States Enact Integrated Plans to Decarbonize Buildings;"More states are enacting laws to promote electric vehicles as well as wind and solar energy. Washington State passed legislation prohibiting the sale of automobiles with internal combustion engines beginning with model year 2030. Other states are pushing to decarbonize buildings, notably with heat pumps, as part of comprehensive legislation that considers impacts on energy efficiency, the power grid, and natural gas pipes.  
Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker (R) signed sweeping climate legislation on August 11 to expand offshore wind energy, prohibit the sale of internal combustion engine automobiles after 2035, and put restrictions on natural gas in newly constructed buildings. Maryland and New York also passed laws this year to begin the transition away from on-site combustion of fossil fuels for building heat, which accounts for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. 
Decarbonizing building heating systems will require greater efficiency for new and existing buildings, including net-zero building codes and beneficial electrification. Renewable thermal energy—such as ground-source heat pumps—will also be needed, along with grid infrastructure investments for greater reliability and deployment of small renewable energy generation and storage technologies, known as distributed energy resources. 
Energy efficiency will be key to limiting electricity demand as buildings shift from natural gas to electric heat pumps for both space and water heating. Right-sized electricity demand will, in turn, help policymakers and regulators better plan and coordinate electrical grid and natural gas pipe investments for an affordable energy delivery system. 
Massachusetts is taking steps to plan these energy investments. Its new law, “An Act driving clean energy and offshore wind,” requires greater building efficiency, including mandatory energy usage reporting for buildings larger than 20,000 square feet, which is the necessary first step to implement a building performance standard in the future. Passed by the state legislature on July 31, the law requires utilities to submit plans for improving transmission and distribution systems so the grid can be more reliable and resilient while accommodating the shift to renewable generation. 
Massachusetts will allow municipalities to begin pilot programs that may prohibit the use of fossil fuels in new buildings. Expecting a shift away from gas, starting in 2025, Massachusetts will eliminate incentives for new fossil-fuel equipment, except as a backup thermal energy source for heat pumps. The state will also offer research and grants to promote the use of ground-source heat pump systems, which take advantage of more consistent underground temperatures, making them more efficient than air-source heat pumps.  
Maryland’s Climate Solutions Now Act, passed in April, focuses on energy efficiency in its building decarbonization efforts. The state’s new building energy performance standard will require owners of inefficient buildings to make upgrades. The standard covers buildings larger than 35,000 square feet and is projected to reduce emissions 20% by 2030. The law also increases Maryland’s annual savings target for its utility-run energy efficiency program and establishes a statewide greenhouse gas savings target, which will encourage beneficial building electrification as an efficiency measure. To prepare for greater reliance on decarbonized heat in the future, Maryland’s law calls for a planning study for gas and electric companies to serve customers under a managed transition to a highly electrified building sector. 
Though slightly less comprehensive than Massachusetts and Maryland in terms of heating decarbonization, New York’s recently enacted law requires greater efficiency in appliance standards and energy savings through strengthened building codes. The building and appliance standards are estimated to save New Yorkers $800 million annually on utility bills by 2025, rising to $1.3 billion per year by 2030, according to a report prepared by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. To offer an alternative to fossil-fuel heating systems fueled by natural gas, heating oil, or propane, another New York law allows utilities to own and operate thermal energy networks with regulatory oversight, similar to the networked geothermal energy systems that Massachusetts is considering. New York’s law will ensure progress toward the state’s 2025 energy efficiency target of reducing on-site energy consumption by 185 trillion British thermal units.    
Massachusetts, Maryland, and New York are not the only states to approve clean energy legislation this year. The District of Columbia passed a law mandating a net-zero building code, which requires highly efficient building designs that use renewable energy. Other climate-leading states such as Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, and Washington also recently passed significant clean energy laws, each of which will make meaningful progress toward reducing the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden last week, incentivizes building decarbonization, providing $9 billion for states to issue rebates to homeowners for whole-home retrofits and for heat pumps for space and water heating. As states look to harness resources from the federal government, policymakers and regulators should seek holistic approaches to beneficial electrification and building decarbonization to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.

Analysis: States Lag in Supporting Healthy, Affordable, Decarbonized Homes;"Washington, DC—Amid an affordable housing shortage across much of the United States, new research finds most states are not doing nearly enough to support healthy, affordable, decarbonized housing for the most vulnerable families. A first-of-its-kind scorecard from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) evaluates each state across 33 possible actions to reduce pollution and housing costs for residents through energy efficiency, electrification, and renewable energy investments.
ACEEE’s Pathways to Healthy, Affordable, Decarbonized Housing: A State Scorecard evaluates states on policies such as incentives for low-income households to install solar panels, prioritizing health and safety repairs in home weatherization initiatives, and protecting customers behind on utility bills from shutoffs if they apply to participate in energy efficiency programs.
Maryland performed the best, tallying 54.5 points out of 100 available, followed by Rhode Island with 54 points and California scoring 52 points. No other states earned more than half of the available points.
“Our research shows that states need to enact much stronger policies and significantly expand investments to enable people with low incomes to live in healthy, affordable, decarbonized homes. States have a tremendous opportunity to improve people's daily lives with energy upgrades in homes, but we haven't seen enough states stepping up,” said Sara Hayes, lead author of the report and director of ACEEE’s health and environment program.
The Scorecard reviews five policy areas, with 20 points available for each:
Energy utilities: The Scorecard reports that 41 states and the District of Columbia have policies encouraging utilities to provide more efficiency programs for low-income households, despite their sometimes higher cost. The report finds that Washington State is the only state to prohibit utility shutoffs between November and March for households who demonstrate their inability to pay and apply for low-income weatherization and home energy assistance. This has the short-term benefit of keeping the homes heated during the cold winter months and the long-term benefit of harnessing weatherization to lower utility bills and thus make nonpayment less likely.
Weatherization and energy cost assistance: The research shows 25 states and the District of Columbia supplement the federal Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) with state funds, allowing more households to be served. Colorado is the only state that currently leverages WAP money to integrate solar energy for low-income households.
State housing policies: State housing finance agencies in New York and California are leading in this area, with strong support for both electrification and energy efficiency for affordable housing residents, which can lower utility bills. Only four other states—Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, and Vermont—scored points for incentivizing electrification. Electrifying affordable housing is important because it eliminates indoor combustion of fossil fuels, yielding health and safety benefits, especially for people with respiratory conditions.
Healthy homes and communities: Maryland scored best because of its remediation of health and safety threats through home repairs. It devotes 20% of its WAP spending to health and safety services. Maryland's Children's Health Insurance Program funds in-home services that remediate lead and asthma triggers. Wisconsin has established multiple programs and funding sources to make home repairs to address health and safety hazards that prevent families from receiving weatherization services, which can reduce triggers for asthma and other respiratory diseases.
Cross-agency coordination, community engagement, and statewide standards: The District of Columbia is a leader in adopting building energy performance standards for multifamily buildings, which require owners of inefficient buildings to make upgrades. Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island were the only states to score points for implementing policies to support community engagement in efficiency programs.
Six of the 10 lowest-ranked states lead the nation for the highest percentages of families living in poverty. The poverty levels in these states (Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, and Kentucky) mean that implementing the policies outlined in the Scorecard could be particularly impactful.

One-Third of Tenants Behind on Utility Bills, Highlighting Need for Energy Upgrades;"    Renter households that were behind on energy bills were also more likely to report being behind on rent when being surveyed, according to an analysis averaging experimental Census Bureau data collected since July 2021. Our analysis of that new data, from last month’s Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, reveals that 33% of roughly 44 million renter households across the United States were behind on their energy bills in the past year. Among those behind on energy bills nearly every month, almost half were also behind on rent.
Energy efficiency upgrades could help renters keep up with these bills by lowering monthly energy costs, but property owners must approve these improvements and are unlikely to do so amid reduced rental income. Recent research indicates that owners seeing decreased rental income from their properties since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic are less likely to invest in their buildings. Policymakers and utility regulators can address this problem with increased funding for energy efficiency programs targeting rental properties that are home to energy-insecure households.
Energy insecurity is characterized by households falling behind on their energy bills, forgoing payment of other bills and necessities like food or medicine to keep the lights or heat on, or using risky strategies such as heating their homes with an oven or taking out a high-interest payday loan to pay for their energy needs. A common characteristic these households share is that they live in older energy-inefficient homes that have not been weatherized, lack newer and more efficient appliances, or need heating and cooling equipment upgrades.
Renters, who are more likely to live in less efficient housing and have lower incomes, are particularly prone to experiencing energy insecurity. This leaves many renters with high energy burdens, meaning that a large share of their income goes toward energy costs. Renters who are Black or Hispanic, have young children, or use substantial electricity to power an essential medical device also experience high rates of energy insecurity. A study from 2021 showed these groups were also more likely to experience more severe and higher rates of energy security during the first months of the pandemic.
Recent Energy Insecurity Trends
Of the renters who reported being unable to pay their energy bills in the Census Bureau's July 2022 Household Pulse Survey, more than 80% said they skipped paying on bills and other necessities, and 44% reported keeping their home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature at least once to save on energy over the previous year. More than two out of every five renters struggling to pay energy bills in the July survey also reported feeling anxious, worried, or down for more than half of the previous 14 days.
The most recent survey data also align with what previous studies have documented regarding energy insecurity rates for households of color and those with low incomes. As shown in the above chart, those with lower incomes are more likely to be behind on their energy bills.  Shown in the chart below, half of Black renter households reported being behind on energy bills.
Over the last two years, the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey has tracked several key social and economic indicators to show how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people’s lives. In July 2021, the Census Bureau began asking about energy insecurity, documenting households’ ability to pay energy bills and methods they used to cope with unaffordable energy costs, from forgoing other expenses to adjusting household temperatures to unhealthy levels. The most recent survey period covered June 29 to July 11, 2022, and asked respondents about their experiences during the previous 12 months. We analyzed data from these surveys to arrive at the estimates in this blog post, excluding only a small number of respondents who did not answer the survey questions we examined.
More Energy Efficiency Incentive and Grant Dollars Are Needed
Robust energy efficiency incentive and grant programs will be needed to encourage owners of rental properties with energy-insecure residents to pursue energy upgrades. Many landlords are not in a financial position to pay for energy upgrades. But help is on the way. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act contains programs that could support rental property retrofits, and the bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year included $3.5 billion in low-income weatherization funding and $550 million in Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants for state and local governments to administer clean energy programs. ACEEE’s Energy Equity for Renters initiative and Multifamily Energy Savings Project offer guidance on how government and utility energy efficiency administrations can design and implement effective rental energy efficiency incentive and grant programs.

Congress Approves Massive Win for Climate and Cutting Energy Bills;"Washington, DC—The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released the following statement from Steven Nadel, its executive director, in response to the U.S. House passing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and sending it to President Joe Biden for his signature:
“This is a massive win for our climate and for reducing energy costs for households and businesses.
“It’s going to enable more-efficient and electrified homes, with an unprecedented focus on helping low-income households make home improvements that cut utility bills and improve health and comfort. It’s going to improve access to lower-cost, efficient transportation options for businesses and families, and it includes several crucial steps toward decarbonizing industry. While far more investment will ultimately be needed to address the climate crisis, these programs put us on a much better path.
“Now it will be up to federal agencies, states, cities, and the private sector to make the bill’s vision a reality. Every single state will need to work expediently to set up rebate programs to enable residents to make major energy-saving home improvements. For states with older housing or limited efficiency programs, this bill represents a particularly timely opportunity to help residents live better while paying lower utility bills.
“Once the president signs this, let’s get to work.”

The Climate Bill Can Accelerate a Transformation in Industry;"Congress’s $369 billion climate and energy investment plan—part of the Inflation Reduction Act set for a final vote in the U.S. House on Friday—includes provisions that can accelerate step-change greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions from industry. It is crucial to spur these reductions, as industry emits more than a quarter of total U.S. GHG emissions.
A key to the industrial decarbonization effort in the bill is a $5.8 billion Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program (AID for short) that will accelerate deployment of advanced industrial decarbonization technologies. Housed in the Department of Energy (DOE), this program will provide companies grants or loans for up to 50% of the cost of deployment of low-carbon-emitting technologies directly involved in industrial processes of energy-intensive industries.
Achieving net-zero GHGs in industry by 2050 will take trillions of dollars of investments from the private sector, government, and the finance community. Companies are understandably hesitant to take on these enormous technical and financial risks. The government cost-sharing provided by AID will help companies make the investments to bring transformative, low-carbon production processes to commercial scale.
Funds Could Spur Low-Carbon Process Technology
AID targets support for technologies “directly involved in an industrial process” that are “designed to accelerate greenhouse gas emissions reduction progress to net-zero.” This can include technologies that generate and spur the use of low-carbon process heat (today, process heat is responsible for 50% of the energy used in industry).
Congress also directed the program to support the incorporation of sustainable chemistry and engineering practices and approaches that use materials and energy effectively, decrease health and environment impacts, reduce waste, and make recycling and reuse easier. And the program will fund improvements in the energy and materials efficiency of processes at a more holistic, broader scale, using smart manufacturing, information technology, and high-performance computing approaches.
Examples of low-carbon process technology innovations that could gain support from AID include low-GHG processes for the manufacture of steel such as direct reduction iron (DRI) using hydrogen made from renewable electricity. Application of this technology at scale could reduce CO2 emissions some 95% versus a conventional process. That’s a big deal, as iron and steel production accounts for 7% of U.S. industrial emissions at 90 million metric tons per year. Direct reduction using a molten oxide at high temperature or aqueous bath at low temperature via electrolysis—both emerging technologies in research, development, and deployment (RD&D) —could use less electricity than current DRI.
In the chemicals sector, examples now in RD&D could include scaling the electric crackers for generating ethylene from ethane. These processes could slash CO2 emissions from ethane production by more than 50%. That’s also a big deal, as ethane crackers alone account for 47 million metric tons per year of CO2 emissions. 
Step-change innovations in process technology are also needed to complement the pursuit of energy efficiency, electrification (with electricity from low-carbon sources), hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels and feedstocks, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage. Even with the aggressive pursuit of these decarbonization pillars, it is likely that additional approaches will be needed to help tackle the remaining 10%–20% of GHG emissions from industry. Deployment of low-carbon process technology, with early demonstrations at scale supported by AID, can help address this gap.
Demonstration of low-carbon process technologies at scale will help accelerate the dispersion of these technologies throughout industry. When it is proven that these low-carbon process technologies are viable at scale, benefits beyond carbon reductions (improved production flexibility, quality, lower wastes) could be realized. This will also create market pull for the low-carbon approaches associated with the pillars noted above.  For example, deployment at scale of electric crackers could accelerate use of low-carbon electricity in industry. Demonstration of DRI with renewable hydrogen could increase its market pull, lowering cost and increasing scale.
Bill Will Help Companies Make the Difficult Leap to Low-Carbon Technologies
Deployment of low-carbon technologies at industrial scale can be very costly. A direct reduction iron facility installed by Cleveland Cliffs in Toledo cost well over $1 billion, and although it is ready for hydrogen, the integration with renewable hydrogen has not yet occurred. Ethane crackers cost $1–1.5 billion. The first installation of an electric cracker at scale would be even more expensive. Few single corporations would risk the company on developing and deploying a low-carbon technology by themselves. The AID funding provides cost sharing to help cover engineering costs and reduce risks for the first few low-carbon technology deployments. In the process it will encourage companies to work together in consortia to deliver these challenging advances.
AID can help spur the revolutionary changes needed to manufacture the low-carbon products called for by customers, and support the push by some states and the federal government to preferentially procure low-carbon materials. This aligns with provisions in the bill to support labeling for low–embodied carbon products. The bill also expands the 48C manufacturing tax credit and DOE’s loan guarantee program, supporting further deployment of these technologies.
The investments in AID can jump-start industry’s drive to process innovation and to net-zero GHGs—and that’s exactly what we need.

Congress Is Set to Vote on the Largest Efficiency Investments in History;"The proposed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes the largest combined investments in energy efficiency in U.S. history. If enacted in the coming weeks, it will provide tens of billions of dollars to improve our buildings, vehicles, and industry.
Energy efficiency is an essential part of the $369 billion IRA climate package, which will be a big step toward meeting President Biden’s climate and equity goals. While far more investment will be needed to address the climate crisis, the IRA investments—to be made over the next 5–10 years—will put us on a much better path. And the investments will save money for American consumers and businesses, grow the energy efficiency and clean energy industries, improve public health, and strengthen energy security.
Here are some of the energy efficiency highlights in the bill negotiated by Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY):
Buildings
Homes and commercial buildings account for almost a third of U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To slash those emissions, we need to build new zero-net-energy buildings (highly efficient buildings that generate as much solar or other clean power as they consume) and we need to retrofit existing buildings in order to reduce air leaks and other waste and use efficient, electric equipment. IRA would turbocharge these efforts, making millions of homes and commercial buildings more comfortable and cheaper to operate as well as reducing their emissions.
The bill provides $9 billion for states to issue rebates to homeowners for whole-home retrofits and for efficient heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and other electrical equipment (and training and education for contractors). Most of those funds would be for low- and moderate-income households, and the bill provides billions more in loans and grants for upgrades to subsidized apartments. IRA also restores and greatly increases tax credits for heat pumps and smaller home improvements such as insulation (25C credit) and strengthens the criteria for and the amount of the tax deduction for commercial building retrofits (179D).
Tax incentives for building highly efficient new homes (45L) and commercial buildings (179D again) also get a big boost, including extra incentives for “zero-energy-ready” homes and buildings.
The bill also gives $1 billion in additional aid to help states and cities adopt and implement strong building energy codes—one-third for jurisdictions adopting the latest model codes and two-thirds for those adopting codes to require zero-net-energy buildings. These codes promise major reductions in energy waste in all new buildings while making them more resilient, comfortable, and healthy for their occupants.
Transportation
The transportation sector accounts for more than a quarter of all U.S. GHG emissions. Electric vehicles and a transportation system that provides convenient and efficient alternatives to cars and trucks are key to cutting these emissions. IRA would speed the transition to electric vehicles, especially for larger vehicles like trucks and buses, but will do less to make needed changes to the larger transportation system.
The bill contains an important new tax credit and additional funding for purchasers of electric trucks and buses, which lag behind electric cars and SUVs in deployment. The bill also includes a new $4,000 credit for purchasing used electric cars and SUVs, and it revives the $7,500 credit for new electric vehicles, which had been slowly expiring. However, there are concerns that new requirements for U.S. sourcing of materials and battery components, along with income caps on who can take the credit, will limit usage, particularly in the early years.
The bill does much less for other ways of moving passengers and freight or for broader transportation system efficiency. But it does include $3 billion for a new Neighborhood Access and Equity grant program supporting projects that improve walkability, reduce vehicle pollution, and help residents use affordable transportation to access essential services and green spaces, especially in disadvantaged and underserved communities. This would be the first program focused on transportation equity funded at this level.
Industry
Decarbonizing industry—which accounts for almost a third of U.S. GHG emissions—will require effective energy management, transformative process technologies, use of electricity and low-carbon fuels, carbon capture, and shifts to use of materials responsible for lower life-cycle emissions (lower embodied carbon). IRA would provide significant support for the initial deployment of key technologies.
Most notably, it includes almost $6 billion for grants and loans to companies that use innovative decarbonization technologies, like direct reduction of iron from ore using hydrogen instead of fossil fuels or inert anode aluminum production. This Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program, housed in the Department of Energy (DOE), would help enable full-scale commercialization of these new technologies.
IRA also allocates $10 billion for the 48C tax credit for transformative investments in manufacturing facilities and expands the credit to cover equipping an industrial plant to reduce GHG emissions by at least 20% (among other uses). The bill adds a tax incentive for clean hydrogen and expands one for carbon capture, and it provides more than $4 billion to label and buy low-embodied-carbon building and transportation materials.  
Provisions That Cut across Sectors
The bill also includes cross-cutting investments that could be used in buildings, transportation, or industry. The Environmental Protection Agency would disburse $27 billion for a GHG reduction fund, with a majority of funds for green banks and other nonprofits and most of those funds designated for low-income and disadvantaged communities. And it would deliver $3 billion in grants and assistance for environmental and climate justice work by community-based organizations and $5 billion in climate pollution reduction grants. The bill also increases the lending authority at DOE’s Loan Programs Office by $40 billion for large energy projects that reduce GHG emissions.
Proposals to transform the electric system were dropped from discussions long ago, but IRA would provide billions to support rural electric cooperatives, including for improving the efficiency of power plants and transmission.
Building a Strong Foundation for Climate Action
The Senate plans to consider the bill this week under its budget reconciliation procedure, which only requires a simple majority to pass. If enacted, these investments together promise to kick-start growth of most of the key measures identified in ACEEE’s Call to Action: electric vehicles, heat pumps, zero-energy buildings, industrial decarbonization, and more.
While this is the largest combined efficiency investment so far, trillions of dollars more will be needed to address the climate crisis while improving health, equity, and the economy. We need strong federal regulations through both new legislation and agency actions under existing laws. We also need effective state and local policies and long-term commitment from corporations. IRA will spur development of key efficiency technologies and industries, providing a foundation for private investment and further state, local, and federal action needed to solve the climate crisis.

Climate Bill Would Make Historic Energy-Saving Investments in Buildings, Industry, Transportation;"Washington, DC—The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released the following statement from Steven Nadel, its executive director, in response to Senate Democrats releasing text of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022:
""We need bold action to address both the climate crisis and the challenges of high energy bills. This plan includes historic investments that will reduce energy waste, cut costs for homes and businesses, and slash greenhouse gas emissions.
""It would enable major efficiency and electrification upgrades in millions of homes and buildings to save energy and improve comfort and health, especially for low- and moderate-income households. It would provide transformational investments to help American industry decarbonize and become more competitive using next-generation low-carbon technologies. It would accelerate the shift to clean, electric vehicles while widening access to affordable transportation and cutting air pollution in disadvantaged communities.
“We cannot wait. We urgently need these investments, and Congress should pass this bill into law.”

Analysis: Electric Heat Pumps Offer Cheapest Clean Heating Option for Most U.S. Houses;"Washington, DC—Electric heat pumps generally offer the cheapest way to cleanly heat and cool single-family homes in all but the coldest parts of the United States in coming decades, according to research released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). In very cold places, the analysis finds, electric heat pumps with an alternative fuel backup for frigid periods minimize costs.

As states and utilities look to reduce planet-warming emissions, they need to help households transition to cost-effective heating and cooling that use clean energy. To look at options, the ACEEE report evaluated the energy use of several thousand homes across the United States. It considered life-cycle costs for equipment and energy under a scenario in which the electric grid and heating fuels are largely decarbonized beginning in 2030. 
For homes with up to four units, electric heat pumps generally minimize heating and cooling costs in places that are warmer than Detroit. These places have fewer than 6,000 heating degree days (HDD)—a measure of how much seasonal temperatures fall below 65°F. In colder climates, electric heat pumps combined with use of a backup fuel during frigid periods (below 5°F) generally minimize these costs. For water heating, electric heat pumps minimize costs in all climates. 
“Our findings are good news for consumers and for the climate. Electric heat pumps, which heat and cool, are the cheapest clean heating option for many houses, especially now that we have cold-climate models,” says Steven Nadel, report coauthor and ACEEE’s executive director. “We need to accelerate the use of electric heat pumps, emphasizing cold-climate models in places colder than Maryland,” he adds, noting Maryland has about 4,000 HDD.
Electric heat pumps are energy efficient because they don’t create heat by burning fuels but rather move it (during the heating season) from cold outdoors to warm indoors. Cold-climate models, an advance in technology, operate efficiently at temperatures as low as 5°F. Their energy costs, however, are minimized if an alternative fuel backup kicks in when it gets colder than 5°F for long periods.
For large multifamily buildings, electrification is more complex. Individual units generally don’t use a lot of energy, so recouping the costs of electrification takes longer. Based on limited and preliminary data, the analysis finds that using alternative fuels in condensing boilers often minimize life-cycle costs, whereas using electric heat pumps in apartments now with furnaces generally lowers costs.
The report recommends incentives or other assistance for low- and moderate-income households, whose homes are often the most difficult to decarbonize. Notably, it calls for help to reduce the costs of ductless electric mini-split heat pumps in multifamily buildings. The analysis finds that higher-income households are more likely to minimize costs with electric heat pumps, because they have newer—and more likely, single-family—homes with air-conditioning and improved energy efficiency.
“Electrification will play a crucial role in decarbonizing homes, but the transition will happen slowly as long as inexpensive fossil fuels are widely available,” says Lyla Fadali, report coauthor and ACEEE senior researcher. To accelerate this transition, the report also calls for research and development of heat pumps, minimum efficiency standards for heating equipment, restructuring electric (and perhaps gas) rates, and a price on carbon.
The report sees a role for energy efficiency in this transition as well, finding it often reduces life-cycle costs. For many homes, a moderately sized package of efficiency improvements has the lowest life-cycle costs. For homes in cold climates with oil or propane heating, or above-average energy bills, a deep retrofit often reduces these costs. 
The report models the potential life-cycle costs of decarbonized heating options based on the energy use of about 3,000 homes heated with fossil fuels that are part of the Department of Energy’s 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey. It assumes the use of cold-climate pumps in places with 4,000-plus HDD. It estimates the costs of using decarbonized energy for heating options beginning in 2030, estimating that the costs for gas more than triple and costs for electricity increase 30% in Minnesota. Its results, based on medium cost assumptions for equipment and energy, change modestly at higher and lower energy prices and system costs.
This 2015 survey uses old climate data. It looks at the average HDD for each home based on 30-year (1981–2010) averages. Because of climate change, most of the United States is warming, and its HDD are declining. To provide a more up-to-date picture, ACEEE used U.S. government data to calculate 15-year (2006–20) averages, as shown in the map below. Philadelphia averages about 4,300 HDD, while northern Minnesota often has more than 8,000.
As the United States continues to warm, fewer places will have more than 6,000 HDD—the inflection point beyond which electric heat pumps may need decarbonized fuel backup to operate most cost-effectively. Instead, cooling needs will increase. Electric heat pumps can efficiently meet these needs in all climates.

Five Lessons from My First Year with Mini-Split Heat Pumps;"Last summer I bought my first home. On the day I met my house-to-be, one of the first things I noticed was its system of ductless mini-split heat pumps. I was immediately excited. From my work at ACEEE, I knew that heat pumps are one of the most energy-efficient ways to heat and cool a home (they use less than half the energy of electric resistance heat over the course of a heating season and also provide efficient air-conditioning; rather than burning fuel to create heat, they move heat from one location to another). If the electricity that powers them comes from renewable sources, they can also help us transition away from fossil fuels. Having looked at other homes with old, inefficient heating systems and no air-conditioning, I knew I would much rather have a heat pump system (without having to go through a retrofit myself).
My home is in Vermont, but before moving here I lived for five years in Washington and Oregon, two states that have prioritized the transition to heat pumps and home electrification. I frequently heard my Pacific Northwest neighbors rave about their heat pumps, particularly the air-conditioning feature as the region’s summers—historically relatively cool—are bringing more heat waves. I had rented one home with a heat pump and knew I liked it, so it was a definite draw for me when I was a prospective buyer.
But I still had a lot to learn. I moved in during hot, humid August, and I was eager to get the AC going. Each room has its own mini-split unit. One room was nice and cool, but I couldn't get the other rooms—including my bedroom—equally comfortable. Only after contacting the installer did I learn my first two important lessons
Lesson 1: Know your remote. A lot of a mini-split’s functionality is hidden in the remote control. Just as you know your own TV remote and have to figure out a hotel’s, my Washington rental home had a Mitsubishi heat pump, but my new house has Daikin. It turns out most of the Daikin's functionality is hidden under a sliding plastic cover I hadn't noticed in my haste to cool down the house. Slide it down and you'll see all the options you need.
  Lesson 2: Mode selection is key. Mini-split heat pumps have both indoor units (an air-handler sometimes called a ""head"") and outdoor units (the compressor/condenser). You can have two or three indoor heads connected to the same outdoor compressor, but all the heads need to be on the same mode. For example, if you have two bedrooms connected to the same compressor but each with its own head, you can't have one on heating mode and one on cooling mode. But you can have different cooling setpoints, such as keeping a bedroom or workout room cooler than the rest of the house—I love this feature. Changing the mode is as easy as pressing the ""mode"" button and watching an icon change from sun (heat) to snowflake (cool). Once I figured this out, I switched all my units to cooling mode and was amazed at how comfortable they kept the house.
Once I learned the basics of using my heat pump system, I was thrilled with it. Although some experts say that a backup source of (fossil) fuel heat might be needed in the coldest climates, my system got me through my first Vermont winter in total comfort. I was never tempted to turn on the small electric resistance backup heaters in my house.
Being new to homeownership and to maintaining a house, one question had nagged me: Did I need to have these heat pumps cleaned? I’d heard mixed opinions on this, but having no idea if the previous owner had done any maintenance, and knowing the importance of indoor air quality, I decided to hire a local company, We Clean Heat Pumps, to do a thorough cleaning. I was nervous they would find damage from deferred maintenance, but it turned out to be a great experience: a knowledgeable, experienced technician came to my house and spent several hours thoroughly cleaning each indoor and outdoor unit and answering my many questions. Thanks to his visit, I learned more useful lessons:
Lesson 3: Heat pumps do more than cool and heat. The technician showed me how to use the mini-split's ""dry"" setting correctly (this is technically a “cool” setting to dehumidify using a low fan speed, so if you have two heads on the same compressor, you can have one on “dry” and one on “cool;” I do this often in the summer). I’d already put a stand-alone dehumidifier in the basement (ENERGY STAR® of course), but since putting the heat pump on “dry” mode, the amount of water collecting in the dehumidifier's bucket has decreased dramatically, and I have noticed how cool the basement stays using both “dry” mode and the standalone dehumidifier. I've also noticed a decrease in certain insects that seek out humid spaces, and it's reassuring to know this should also help prevent mold and mildew. If it’s humid but not too hot, you can use the heat pump system as a whole-house dehumidifier. Also, the mini-splits are nearly silent—much quieter than both the dehumidifier and every window AC unit I’ve ever heard.
Lesson 4: Cleaning is important, but it doesn’t have to be difficult. Once a quarter, you should remove the filters and gently wash off any debris. If they look really dirty, you can do this more often. I am not particularly handy or tech-savvy, but I am now confident I can do this. Be careful using any pressure-washing devices on the delicate “fins” of your unit as they can be easily damaged if you are too aggressive. Heat pump technicians have specially calibrated pressure washers. Do not spray any chemicals into the indoor or outdoor units. A professional cleaning once a year will help keep your system running efficiently and identify maintenance needs so you don’t get stuck with a malfunction in cold or hot weather.
Lesson 5: Protect your heat pumps when you work on your house. Many contractors—HVAC or otherwise—are not yet familiar with heat pumps. If you are having work done on your house, even something basic like painting, take simple steps to protect your indoor units from dust and debris.  Covering them with a plastic bag or sheet should work fine. One of my mini-split covers was caulked to the wall for unknown reasons. The technician detached it but noted that he sees all sorts of strange things in homes: from needless caulking to units located behind built-in furniture. This was a reminder that the field experience of technicians, installers, and users is unlikely to be identical from one home to the next.
In my case, the professional cleaning was well worth the money. I have peace of mind knowing I'm maintaining my system and taking an important step toward good indoor air quality (recognizing that good indoor air quality depends on many factors beyond your HVAC system, including cooking and combustion, pets, dampness, and sources of pollution [furnishings, chemical products, activities like smoking]).
For people to be happy with their heat pumps—which is critical to market transformation—they need to know how to use them properly and how to optimize their performance for a comfortable home.

Leading States Chart Path for Cutting Emissions with Electrification, Pointing Way for Peers;"A small but growing number of states are enabling utilities to offer incentives for customers to switch from fossil fuel heating to electric heat pumps. Yet almost half of states have not implemented fuel-switching programs to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from home heating.
As many states have strengthened their climate goals in recent years, policymakers are working with regulators and utilities to reshape energy efficiency programs to support efforts to eliminate statewide GHG emissions by mid-century. This has meant reexamining and updating efficiency policy frameworks that traditionally have encouraged reducing electricity or gas usage but have not promoted the transition to heating with efficient electric heat pumps. Traditional policies fail to deliver additional economic, health, and climate benefits achieved through beneficial electrification. Because burning fossil fuels in buildings accounts for 13% of total U.S. emissions, accelerating the electrification of these end uses is critical for meeting climate goals.
A new policy brief from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) shows a changing landscape of utility energy efficiency policies with new fuel-switching incentive structures emerging in key states. Our last look at these policies, in 2020, saw limited adoption of electrification incentive structures, mostly limited to northeastern states like New York, Massachusetts, and Maine. The new report shows similar efforts in other parts of the country.
Three major clean energy laws that passed in 2021 have moved the ball forward: Minnesota’s Energy Conservation and Optimization (ECO) Act, Illinois’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, and Colorado’s beneficial electrification law. Each directs regulators to update efficiency policies to encourage electrification through increased customer incentives. These new laws are helping lay the foundation for utility reforms that will make adoption of heat pump technologies more affordable for millions of customers.
Despite the progress made in some states, many states do not encourage energy-efficient fuel switching, with at least 12 states explicitly prohibiting or discouraging use of efficiency funds for fuel switching, posing a barrier to accelerating heat pump deployment.
Our new policy brief provides a status update of these policies (or lack thereof) in all 50 states and Washington, DC, including summaries and links to relevant legislation, utility rulemakings, and guidance documents addressing these efforts. We recommend that states that have not yet enacted these reforms follow examples of leading peers and:
Enact laws directing utilities to develop beneficial electrification programs. In Colorado, new utility electrification programs must include targeted numbers of installations and projected GHG emissions reductions. In Massachusetts, climate legislation passed in 2021 significantly reframed utility energy efficiency plans around a focus on building decarbonization through weatherization and efficient electrification, including benchmarks for air-source and ground-source heat pumps.
Clarify that state efficiency programs can fund electrification that results in net energy and emissions savings. This can help make clear that efficiency funds are eligible to be used for measures resulting in net GHG reductions from efficient fuel-switching measures like electrification. For example, Minnesota’s ECO Act expanded the scope of measures to be funded by the state’s Conservation Improvement Program to allow fuel-switching measures if such measures result in a net decrease in source energy consumption on a fuel-neutral basis. In March 2022, the state Department of Commerce issued technical guidance for utilities to determine if a fuel-switching improvement meets these criteria and to calculate energy savings associated with such an improvement.
Adopt an energy efficiency resource standard that aligns energy-saving programs with efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Adopting a multi-fuel metric measured in British thermal units (Btu) from such measures, and ultimately encourage heat pump adoption, New York has established a fuel-neutral 2025 energy efficiency target of 185 trillion Btu including a minimum Btu heat pump savings target. In Massachusetts, to support the state’s 2030 economy-wide emissions reduction target set in the 2021 law, the state has established GHG savings goals for efficiency programs for the 2022-24 period. The Mass Save program has established a scorecard for annual metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent avoided by efforts undertaken during the 2022-24 period.
Fully value the energy and climate benefits of beneficial electrification in program planning and evaluation. Cost-effectiveness tests that neglect the full range of societal and customer benefits of fuel-switching programs can also slow heat pump adoption. Several states have taken steps to refine calculations of energy and carbon savings and other benefits to better understand impacts on customer costs, emissions, and the utility system. Colorado’s new law specifies the cost-benefit analysis requirements for new electrification programs, including incorporating the social costs of carbon dioxide and methane emissions avoided from converting from gas systems to electric heat pumps. Other states are conducting studies and pilot programs to determine customer incentive levels and refine cost-effectiveness. New Jersey is studying payback periods for electrification and on-site electric generation measures with the aim of incorporating cost-effective measures into building and energy codes.
Integrate equity principles to ensure program benefits extend to historically underserved customers. Low-income and underserved communities already bear a disproportionate share of high energy burdens and the impacts of climate change. For the clean energy transition to succeed on a broad scale, it must benefit all communities, not just affluent ones. Several states have established specific requirements prioritizing the low-income sector. In Illinois, a minimum of 25% of all electrification savings must be from electrification of end uses in low-income housing. New electrification plans in Colorado direct at least 20% of funding toward low-income and disproportionately impacted communities and include an outreach plan for engaging those communities.
As states look to meet their mid-century climate goals, the progress in Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and states in the Northeast can help guide policymakers on how to enable efficiency programs that encourage electrification as a means to reduce GHG emissions.

"“Not So Big House” Author Sarah Susanka to Speak at Summer Study; Here’s a Sneak Peek";"In the 1980s, architect Sarah Susanka began noticing a disconnect between the big homes her clients planned to build and what they really wanted. She wrote a book to help them and fellow architects address this problem. But the book reached a much wider audience. Within weeks of its publication in 1998 and her appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, it became a bestseller.
Susanka, author of The Not So Big House, will discuss her build-better-not-bigger approach in a keynote address next month at the biennial Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings. She will offer ideas for how we can create more sustainable homes—and happier lives—by identifying our priorities and designing for them.
Register NOW to avoid late fees
Her message comes at a crucial time. As climate impacts intensify, we need to seek creative ways to rapidly reduce planet-warming emissions. The approach she took to influence the shift toward somewhat smaller and more sustainably built homes has lessons for tackling today’s thorniest issues, including climate change. As Susanka says, “There were a lot of people aspiring to something different than the standard fare.” How do we find the right messages to inspire millions of people to demand change?
  We caught up with Susanka, author of eight other books, including The Not So Big Life, to get a sneak peek at her Summer Study address. Here are excerpts of our conversation:  
What prompted you to write “The Not So Big House” and why do you think it became such a trend-setting bestseller?  
Back in the 1980s and ‘90s, as a founding partner of a 45-person residential architecture firm, I became acutely aware of a disconnect between what people planned to build and what they really wanted. Our new house clients would come into our office asking for the typical floor plan, including formal living and dining rooms. But when we asked them how they lived, most said they didn’t actually use those rooms but needed them for resale, should they ever move. This seemed crazy to me, and I did my best to express my observations to anyone who would listen. 
For years, I spoke at local Home & Garden Shows. This strategy worked amazingly well. It not only brought us clients who started to understand the possibilities of building better rather than bigger, but it also started to change the culture of the city where I lived at the time—Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota. (I now live in North Carolina.)
I got tired, though, of trying to change one mind at a time. I wanted to be able to hand a “treatise” of sorts to each prospective client, explaining this smaller but better approach to design. That’s when The Not So Big House was born. I thought I was writing it for our firm and other residential architects, but what happened once the book was published completely changed my life. I hadn’t realized that what I was seeing as a senseless waste of resources was an insight whose time had clearly come.  Within weeks of the book’s publication in September of 1998, I was a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show and Charlie Rose. More than 20 years later, the series is still selling.
The book’s success had to do with my first recognizing that there were a lot of people aspiring to something different than the standard fare—an increasingly bigger house with spaces they would never use. The book appealed to people who believed that home should be a sanctuary, rather than something to knock the socks off the neighbors, and a place built to last for the way they really lived, as well as for the planet’s well-being. 
Some people credit you with helping spur the tiny-house movement, but you’re not talking about tiny homes. What do you mean by “not so big”?  
When I first used the term, I meant—quite literally—not as big as you thought you would need to build, and reapportioning dollars out of square footage and into quality and character. Typically, a not so big house is around a third smaller than you thought you needed but with the same overall expenditure. It is carefully designed and detailed to last for the long haul, using high quality and sustainable materials.   
This definition has gradually morphed, though, into a broader sensibility about how to approach any challenging situation or issue. A not so big approach is one that takes a simpler, more modest, and straightforward route to any objective, by looking at what is actually happening, rather than by trying to prove something to someone, or trying to impress. Its sensibility can be applied to far more than house design. 
So how can a “not so big” approach help us tackle today’s societal challenges, especially climate change? 
I wrote that first book because I was observing something important about material and energy waste that was invisible to those who didn’t work directly with design-conscious homebuyers. No one realized that many people were living differently than when the basic American house plan was codified. 
Although I had tried initially to get that message across to mortgage lenders, building officials, builders, developers big and small, and my fellow architects, none of them seemed particularly interested. I realized I had to go to the people who did care—those who were forking out giant sums of money for things they didn’t really want—the homeowners themselves. 
It occurs to me, as I contemplate the challenges of solving many of today’s most difficult challenges, that there must be people in the affected fields, such as climate change research, who have a similar access to a perspective that’s not seen by others. What I did was, very simply, to speak about what I knew. I described the problem I had unearthed, and I suggested a solution—writing not for other professionals and academics, but for the would-be homeowners who wanted to build. Although individually they have very little power, when enough of them read or see something that corroborates their own observations and wishes, they flock to that message like bees to honey.   
By speaking what I was seeing, legions of not so big true believers came out of the woodwork to demand change. They did it one by one, but their collective voice changed everything, and in ways I couldn’t have imagined. In other words, I didn’t have to know how or even if change would happen, but I did need to speak. I think this is what we need in many fields right now. I am willing to hazard a guess that there are many today who see, as I did back 25 years ago, something no one else sees and could make a powerful difference by putting it into words or images that those who are affected, or will be, could share. 
That’s a not so big approach to climate change if ever there was one. And I believe, because of my own experience, that it could work. I don’t know what the insights are that could be shared, but I bet some of the people reading this do. 
How have you applied the “not so big” approach to your own life and how could others do the same?  
For that first book, I had to extract myself at least a little from the straitjacket of what I called “my life” to find the time to write. I had always loved writing, but I couldn’t imagine how to find the time. But a day came when I realized unequivocally that I just had to begin. I had to write this stuff down. And as I did, all the things I needed to support my writing fell into place. That was when I really started to live in a not so big way. I let go of all the reasons I couldn’t, and simply paid attention to what I really wanted to do for the good of the whole.
The subtitle for The Not So Big Life is “Making room for what really matters,” and what I’ve come to understand is that what really matters is what we are pulled to do, even when it seems completely impossible. The moment you let go of all the resistances and projections of what bad things will happen if you do, and when instead, you make the time and the space for what you long to do, the world around you shifts in all sorts of apparently miraculous ways to support the realizations of those longings.   
You may read these words and doubt me, but that is in fact what happened in my own life, and it happens in the lives of all those who take that leap of faith, without knowing how it will all work out. The only question is how long it takes us to respond to those longings. The future of our species and the health of our planet may well depend upon it. Our job is not to try to figure it all out first, but just to move with what we are called to explore. That’s the path to a highly satisfying and meaningful not so big life, and it’s also, more importantly, the bridge to a truly sustainable future.

Jettisoning Climate Bill Would Be an Enormous Mistake;"Washington, DC—The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released the following statement from Steven Nadel, its executive director, in response to news reports on Senator Joe Manchin’s comments on enacting major climate and energy investments:
“Congress has been considering historic investments to help mitigate the climate crisis, including investments in energy efficiency that would reduce energy costs for households and businesses. Jettisoning those plans would be an enormous mistake. We hope this plan will be revived, but with every delay, aggressive executive actions to reduce costly energy waste only become more urgent for consumers and for the climate.”

States Can Phase Out Fluorescent Tubes in Favor of LEDs—Like Vermont Just Did;"A first-in-the-nation policy in Vermont phasing out most fluorescent tube lights in favor of LEDs points the way for other states to reduce energy costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and mercury pollution.
Signed by Governor Phil Scott on May 19, Vermont’s law will end the sale of four-foot fluorescent tubes by 2024. California lawmakers are considering enacting similar legislation this year, and other states may do so when their legislatures reconvene in 2023. (In Rhode Island, one chamber passed such a bill this year.)
The four-foot tubes at issue in the Vermont law are often found in commercial buildings and in some kitchens, basements, and garages. They are the most common type of linear fluorescent light, representing about 90% of installations.
Though fluorescent bulbs were once considered an efficient option—at least in comparison to incandescents—great advances in LEDs in recent years have dulled their shine. A recent study we co-published comprehensively shows that LEDs are now available in all needed shapes and sizes—and they cost less to own and operate than fluorescents. That’s great news, because the LEDs use about half as much energy—which means they have lower greenhouse gas emissions—and don’t contain the toxic mercury that fluorescent bulbs do.
The following table compares the key characteristics of a common four-foot fluorescent tube and its LED alternative, and the dollar savings from switching to an LED from a fluorescent, based on national averages:
We estimate that Vermont residents and businesses will save a cumulative $167 million on utility bills through 2040 thanks to more than 1,000 gigawatt hours of reduced electricity use, all due to transitioning away from the four-foot fluorescents. A typical school could see more than $5,000 in annual utility bill savings if all its fluorescent lamps were replaced with LEDs. Our report quantifies the mercury pollution and carbon dioxide emissions each state would avoid—and how much money its residents and businesses would save in reduced energy costs—by ending the sale of fluorescents.
States can phase out fluorescents by focusing on their mercury pollution
States are generally preempted from setting energy efficiency standards for many types of fluorescent light bulbs because the federal government has already done so. The key to Vermont’s law is that it focuses on protecting residents from the mercury in fluorescent bulbs, which can damage the human brain even in miniscule quantities.
An estimated 75% of fluorescent bulbs used in the United States are not recycled or disposed of properly. Mercury leached from landfills eventually reaches rivers, lakes, and oceans, where it bioaccumulates in fish and shellfish. Consumption of contaminated seafood is the leading cause of human exposure to mercury. Broken bulbs in homes and buildings, if not properly cleaned up, can also present a health risk to those nearby.
Laws and rules restricting the use of mercury have generally exempted fluorescent bulbs because—until recently—there was a lack of better options. A previous decision by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation moved to end the sale of general-purpose compact fluorescent lamps, or CFLs, by February 2023, but those bulbs are less widespread than the ones covered by the new law.
Now that LEDs are widely available for the uses fluorescent tubes have served, states should move quickly to follow Vermont’s example. They shouldn’t pass up this opportunity to reduce mercury pollution, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions.

Are U.S. Cities Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions at an Adequate Pace?;"This blog post is the third in a series taking a closer look at the 2021 City Clean Energy Scorecard and expanding upon its findings. Previous posts looked at cities’ progress on energy equity and cities’ actions enabling alternatives to driving.
About 20 U.S. cities that we’ve found are on track to meet their near-term climate goals are also on a path to pull their weight in the global decarbonization effort. But many others will need to step up their emissions-reduction efforts.
Urban areas currently account for more than 70% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally, so reducing their emissions will play a major role in the effort to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees. We found that 20 out of 38 large U.S. cities we examined are on track to achieve GHG reductions in 2050 in line with global benchmarks. (The 38 cities we examined had the necessary GHG emissions data to evaluate their progress; dozens of other large U.S. cities do not.)
In our most recent City Clean Energy Scorecard, we found that a similar group—19 of these same 20 cities—were on track to meet their own near-term GHG emissions reductions goals, usually for 2025 or 2030. These cities demonstrate that near-term successes—if maintained—put them on track to achieve very deep emissions in the long run. The map below identifies these cities:
  Cities’ Climate Responsibility
We set out to determine what per capita GHG emissions level would be attainable for most urban areas by 2050 and project whether cities were on track to achieve that level. We began by referencing a report by the Coalition for Urban Transitions that indicates that urban areas can reduce total GHG emissions by almost 90% below business-as-usual projections by 2050 using technologically feasible and available approaches. Using these approaches, urban GHG emissions can be reduced to about 1.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) total. We pair that assessment with a United Nations estimate that the global population will reach 9.7 billion people by 2050 and that 68% of the population will live in urban areas. The formula below outlines our process for estimating 2050 urban per capita emissions:
  Plugging in the relevant data results in achievable urban per capita emissions reductions of 0.27 MTCO2e in 2050, as demonstrated below:
    Drawing on cities’ emissions data and assuming constant progress, we projected whether they were on track to reduce per capita GHG emissions to 0.27 MTCO2e. We analyzed emissions on a per capita basis to account for changes to city population. We then projected the emissions reduction for cities beginning in the year each respective city adopted its own GHG emissions reduction goal.
  As discussed above, 20 of those cities are currently on track to reduce per capita GHG emissions to 0.27 MTCO2e by 2050. While it is encouraging that most of the cities examined are on track to sufficiently reduce GHG emissions, these cities will need to remain diligent. Meanwhile, cities that are projected not to reduce emissions at this rate can adopt policies with significant GHG reduction potential, such as energy efficiency requirements for existing buildings and smart growth strategies.
What Can Cities Do?
An emphasis on reducing transportation emissions is especially important, as many cities are more focused on decreasing building emissions. Policies to reduce transportation emissions are available and proven. San Francisco, for instance, is both on track to achieve reductions of 0.27 MTCO2e and came in first in the 2021 City Scorecard. This is in part due to the city’s strong transportation initiatives, which include location-efficient zoning, encouraging shifts to sustainable modes of transportation, and having an accessible public transit system.
Cities will need to continue to work to reduce buildings emissions too, as these represent the greatest share of GHG emissions in cities. There has been encouraging progress; the City Scorecard has found that building performance standards are gaining traction across the country. Cities can also adopt more-stringent energy codes, which have a substantial impact on energy use in new buildings over the course of the buildings’ lifetimes.  
Tracking emissions data is essential, too, to know whether cities are achieving significant reductions. The City Scorecard has consistently shown that many cities are not tracking these data.
In the United States, funding from the American Rescue Plan, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and potential future investments pending in Congress could significantly help cities achieve the emissions reductions necessary to keep warming under 1.5 degrees.

Community Engagement, Accountability Key for Equitable Energy Policy;"Communities of color and low-income communities face disproportionate burdens from climate change, yet too often they aren’t centered in the development of energy policies and programs. ACEEE has heard from community-based organizations (CBOs) and advocates that the vast majority of governments and utilities must better engage with impacted communities, increase access to programs, and ensure their benefits are equitably distributed—while transparently tracking progress.
ACEEE also received feedback that our research needs to better incorporate equity-related considerations to ensure that we’re advocating for an equitable energy future. With that in mind, we’re updating the scoring in our next City, State, and Utility Scorecards—adding new metrics that evaluate progress on these measures—to encourage development of more equitable energy programs. By developing these metrics through a collaborative process with CBOs and advocates, ACEEE is learning how to better be transparent and accountable to partners and to center the expertise of disinvested communities in research methodology and advocacy.
Leading with Equity
ACEEE launched the Leading with Equity (LwE) initiative in 2021 with the goal of driving equitable energy efficiency programs using metrics to hold governments and utilities accountable to the equity-related outcomes of their decisions. Workshops with CBOs, advocates, and utilities in 2021 resulted in a collaborative vision of an equitable energy future and prioritized some of the most important actions for governments and utilities to take. This year, we are focusing on implementing the recommended equity metrics in scorecards. In strategy documents ACEEE published this week, we share our plans for each scorecard.
Input from the Communities Most Impacted Is Essential
Advocates and CBOs emphasized to ACEEE that energy efficiency programs must be widely accessible, deliver benefits based on community or household need, and be developed in consultation with communities. These were among the top priorities highlighted in LwE workshops, shown in the figure below. Three examples of policies or actions that we are considering adding in our scorecards are:
State efforts to remediate health and safety barriers to low-income weatherization. Weatherization programs have baseline requirements for homes they service to ensure the homes are ready for weatherization. For example, homes that have severe moisture and mold or dysfunctional electrical or plumbing systems are often rejected for weatherization assistance. This means people experiencing the most health and safety risks, and thus the most need for these programs, may not be able to access them. The 2022 State Scorecard will include a new metric that gives points to states that have government-supported programs that address health and safety issues to ensure that more households can access weatherization. This metric implements recommendations from LwE workshops with CBOs and advocates to incorporate equitable access to and benefits of energy programs into the scorecards.
State planning processes that include strengthened engagement with environmental justice communities. Though their expertise and lived experience provide invaluable guidance, communities of color, low-income communities, and climate vulnerable communities have often been excluded from processes to develop energy programs. A new metric in the 2022 State Scorecard aims to strengthen states’ procedural equity by giving points to states that engage environmental justice communities in their planning processes, as well as those that have staff dedicated to ensuring equity is centered. This metric is related to the LwE priorities of creating equitable engagement processes and providing language access and compensation for engagement.
Tracking and acting to address energy burden. On average, low-income households pay three times the share of their income on energy as non-low-income households, and Black households have an energy burden 45% higher than white households. In our 2022 State Scorecard, ACEEE looks to implement the LwE recommendations to focus on the equitable distribution of energy program benefits and energy affordability by assessing how states address energy burden. This metric will give states points based on how they set goals for energy affordability and energy burden, track progress toward their goals, and respond to that data in order to decrease energy burden for customers.  
Equitable Processes Require Communication and Transparency
In addition to providing valuable data on the most important actions that governments and utilities can take to advance energy equity, this initiative provides lessons in procedural equity. By sharing this process, we hope other organizations looking to advance equity can learn from our experience. This collaborative methodology is new to ACEEE, and we still have a lot to learn. Transparency and accountability are crucial to creating a research process that is more equitable.
We have learned that accountability requires strong communication and responsiveness to feedback we receive. One challenge we face incorporating recommended metrics into the scorecards is making hard decisions about what we can and cannot include in each edition while balancing many objectives and our research capacity. Transparency around these decisions is essential. We need to be specific and report back on changes we did or didn’t make in response to feedback to build trust and make sure our research process is mutually beneficial. For example, if we cannot include a metric because governments or utilities do not have the necessary data, transparently conveying this to CBOs could allow CBOs to advocate for that data collection.
As we move toward embedding equity in our scorecards and other work, we are committed to ensuring the voices of those who have historically been most burdened by the energy system and systems of inequality drive our approach to advocating for a more equitable energy future.

9,000-Pound Electric Hummer Shows We Can’t Ignore Efficiency of EVs;"Electric vehicles have zero tailpipe emissions, unlike their gasoline-combusting counterparts, but they are still responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. As EV sales surge, policymakers and advocates should explore ways to increase their efficiency and reduce the cars’ environmental impact.
Fully electric vehicles with no gasoline engine (which we will refer to as EVs) get their power from the electric grid. And in the United States, about 60% of electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels. Until the grid is completely carbon-free, there will be emissions from generating the electricity to run EVs, known as upstream emissions.
Emissions per mile driven are lower for EVs than for similarly sized gasoline-powered cars, but they are not zero. The Chevy Bolt EV is responsible for about 92 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per mile when accounting for emissions from the electric grid. (The CO2 calculations are based on the national average, but electric grid emissions vary considerably across the country.) The gasoline-powered Chevy Malibu causes over 320 grams per mile. Comparing larger vehicles, the original Hummer H1 emits 889 grams of CO2 per mile and the new Hummer EV causes 341 grams, demonstrating that behemoth EVs can still be worse for the environment than smaller, conventional vehicles.
The environmental impact of EVs isn’t just about the electricity generated to power each mile. The manufacturing process also causes the release of greenhouse gases at several stages, known as the embodied emissions of the vehicle. EVs in particular—with heavy battery packs—use minerals that need to be mined, processed, and turned into batteries. The pursuit of greater driving range and larger vehicles require increasing battery size, also increasing embodied emissions. Mining the minerals used for batteries has a significant impact on the environment and can have negative social impacts, including the well-documented human rights abuses surrounding the mining of cobalt, an important mineral for many EV batteries. More-efficient EVs need less battery to have the same range, which means fewer emissions and fewer of the problems associated with mining the minerals.
Regulators Must Address EV Efficiency
Most drivers have a good sense of how fuel efficient their gasoline-powered vehicle is, and policymakers have recently required greater efficiency in new vehicles. But the efficiency of EVs is often forgotten. As EVs proliferate, their efficiency should be a priority for policymakers. Just as efficiency of gasoline-powered vehicles has numerous benefits for the environment and consumers, greater EV efficiency does too. The less electricity needed to drive a mile, the fewer the emissions from electricity generation, and the more money saved by drivers. Greater efficiency can also mean that automakers could reduce battery size to achieve the same range, leading to less mining and fewer embodied emissions.  
The Environmental Protection Agency should explore ways to factor EV efficiency into fuel-efficiency and greenhouse gas standards, starting with accounting for EVs’ upstream emissions. At the moment, regulators calculate the emissions from gasoline vehicles and set requirements for automakers, but EVs are counted as causing no CO2 emissions. This means the sale of an EV Hummer can offset the sale of a highly polluting gasoline vehicle and increase emissions overall. Accounting for upstream emissions would mean that the sale of a more efficient EV would be more advantageous for automakers to meet their regulatory requirements. All EVs do not have the same impact on the environment, and our vehicle regulations should reflect that.
What Drives EV Efficiency?
EV efficiency, much like the efficiency of gasoline-powered vehicles, is largely affected by the efficiency of the motor and drivetrain as well as the weight and aerodynamics of the vehicle. Energy is lost when going from the battery to the motor to the wheels. The amount lost can vary by vehicle and contributes to a variation in overall efficiency. Efficiency can also vary considerably by the type of vehicle (sedan, crossover, pickup) and its weight. Smaller vehicles tend to be more efficient, so reducing size and weight (as well as improving aerodynamics) can increase efficiency.
Efficiency, often measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per 100 miles of driving, can be improved either through engineering advancements or through reducing vehicle weight and size. Improvements in technology can reduce the amount of energy lost between the battery and the wheels. Decreasing EV weight, including from the battery, can reduce the electricity needed. EVs benefit from regenerative braking, which is when energy is captured from braking and returned to the battery, greatly increasing efficiency. It’s one reason electric drive systems are about twice as efficient as internal combustion engine systems.
More-Efficient EV Models Exist Today
The current EV market is diverse, with vehicles of various sizes, weights, driving ranges, and efficiencies. We used ACEEE’s GreenerCars database to analyze available vehicles and show the variety of options, including levels of efficiency. With better technology and lighter vehicles, automakers can improve efficiency. Figure 1 shows how even EVs of the same weight vary widely in efficiency.
Figure 1. EV efficiency versus weight
We found that lighter vehicles are more efficient in general, but even with roughly the same weight, more-efficient vehicles exist. Among the common weights of 5,000 to 5,500 pounds, there are vehicles with efficiencies ranging from almost 25 kWh/100 miles, the best in the market, to almost 48 kWh/100 miles, amongst the worst. The vehicles with superior efficiency could have more-efficient engines, better aerodynamics, or better regenerative braking systems. In general, though, higher weights are associated with lower efficiency because it takes more energy to move a heavier car.
Battery packs can be a significant portion of an EV’s weight, but for a given battery chemistry a larger battery means more range, a desirable trait for many consumers. Automakers may wish to reduce only the non-battery weight of the vehicle to maintain a high range. We therefore also examined efficiency compared to vehicle weight excluding the battery pack, shown in figure 2.
Figure 2. EV efficiency versus non-battery weight
Even when examining non-battery weight, there is a wide variation in efficiencies, including among the most common non-battery EV weights of between 3,000 and 4,000 pounds. Vehicles in this weight range have efficiencies ranging from 25 to over 45 kWh/100 miles. Decreasing non-battery weight, often by reducing overall size, can considerably increase efficiency. Improving efficiency by 5 kWh/100 miles while keeping weight the same would reduce per mile emissions by 16 grams of CO2—a 14% reduction for a vehicle with an efficiency of 35 kWh/100 miles.
All EVs Are Not Created Equal, So Let's Not Treat Them Like They Are
Policymakers and automakers should put a greater focus on EV efficiency and emphasize its importance for buyers. Greater EV efficiency can reduce emissions from driving and manufacturing the vehicles and increase range and reduce costs. Reducing weight, enhancing aerodynamics, improving electric motors, and reducing battery size will each increase EV efficiency. Current greenhouse gas standards for vehicles do not include the upstream emissions from EVs, missing an opportunity to incentivize greater efficiency, save money, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

How Are Companies Using Efficiency in Climate Efforts? The SEC Should Help Investors Know.;"A proposed federal rule takes an important step toward a cleaner economy by requiring public companies to disclose their climate risks and mitigation efforts. Still, the proposal needs strengthening because it largely overlooks one of the best ways to lessen these risks: energy efficiency.
The pending proposal from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would, for the first time, require companies to disclose the increasing risks they face because of climate change and their efforts to mitigate the risks. Yet it wouldn’t require them to consistently report their energy efficiency actions and achievements nor provide guidance on how to do so.
In comments submitted to the SEC today, ACEEE recommends the plan also require companies to more consistently include energy use and energy-saving measures.
As Climate Risk Grows, Investors Must Know
Climate change threatens the world’s well-being and compromises the global economy. With each passing year the impacts of the climate crisis intensify. For companies, these include risks to physical assets and property, as well as those posed by changing technology and laws as the world moves, albeit slowly, toward a low-carbon economy. For companies of all sizes, the costs of inaction may be tremendous and significantly harm investors.
SEC’s climate risk disclosure plan would require companies to provide investors consistent, comparable, and reliable information on their exposure to climate-related risks. With access to this data, investors could understand which companies are best positioned to hold value. And because companies would have to report their climate risks, they would have greater incentive to try to reduce their risks and greenhouse gas emissions.
Reports Should Disclose Energy Efficiency Measures
SEC’s plan is based on the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and includes reporting on greenhouse gas emissions, climate-related targets, mitigation activities, and transition plans. Though a widely accepted model for climate disclosures, the TCFD framework only briefly mentions energy efficiency.
Yet energy efficiency will play a critical role in reaching a net-zero-emissions economy. The International Energy Agency says that we need to triple the speed of efficiency improvements globally to help get us to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 
While companies understand the general value of energy efficiency, managers who do not focus on it may miss reporting some efficiency opportunities. To provide greater clarity to investors, we recommend that SEC adopt a clear definition of energy efficiency and provide more guidance for consistent reporting of energy efficiency measures and progress. Reporting should use consistent metrics within specific industries and should cover activities in supply chains, a company’s facilities and operations, distribution, and product or service end use.
SEC Should Provide Guidance on Indirect Effects of Products and Services
One of the most critical and controversial pieces of the SEC’s plan is its requirement that some companies report indirect emissions from their upstream supply chains and downstream products, often called “scope 3” emissions. We support this provision, because for many companies the majority of the emissions they cause fall into this category. Without scope 3 disclosure, investors may get a very distorted picture of a company’s climate risk.
However, even scope 3 does not fully capture the emissions impacts from products and services, such as from insulation that reduces a building’s energy use (causing emissions reductions much greater than the emissions from manufacture and shipping of the insulation). Therefore, we recommend that SEC add guidance on how companies can estimate and report the indirect emission effects from these products and services. This “handprint” (distinguished from a company’s emissions “footprint”) is not directly within the control of a company but is often significant within their overall greenhouse gas emissions.
SEC’s Plan Is a Good Step, but It Should Be Strengthened
SEC’s plan to require climate-related financial disclosures will provide real benefits to investors. Those benefits will be even greater if the agency requires companies to transparently disclose energy use and standardize reporting of the energy efficiency measures that do so much of the work of reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also cutting costs.

Communities Look to Electric School Buses to Reduce Pollution, Improve Student Health;"School buses are among the safest vehicles on the road. They are highly visible, with their bright yellow color, flashing red lights, and stop signs that extend when students are entering or exiting. Less than 1% of yearly traffic fatalities involve a school bus, and taking a bus to school is 70 times safer than commuting by car.
Buses are far and away the safest way to get to school, but emissions from their tailpipes are still a threat to public health. About 95% of school buses in the United States are powered by diesel fuel, which when burned emits pollutants that harm human health and warm the planet. Low- and moderate-income households and communities of color face a disproportionate burden from the emissions because of their proximity to major roadways.
Now, as funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law becomes available for school districts to transition their bus fleets from diesel to electricity, we have an opportunity to greatly lessen the threat from these emissions. New analysis from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) shows how making the transition protects the health of school-aged children and their families.
ACEEE’s analysis of New York City (embedded below) and Prince George’s County, Maryland—shown in visual presentations—examined where diesel buses are polluting today and considered what would happen if the buses were instead powered by electricity.
  Click here to view the New York StoryMap in full screen »
  Traveling through dense residential neighborhoods, diesel buses expose people to diesel exhaust. Pollutants from diesel—such as soot, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides—are linked to asthma and respiratory illnesses and can exacerbate heart and lung disease. Children are exposed to these pollutants while buses idle at bus stops and schools as children board and get off the bus. Diesel emissions have also been found inside school buses. Diesel fumes pose a particular risk to children because their lungs and brains are still developing.
Electric buses emit none of these pollutants. But because about 60% of electricity generated in the United States comes from fossil fuels, electric school buses do not completely eliminate emissions, but instead change their location. Since school buses travel along densely populated routes, while most power plants are located in sparsely populated areas, electric buses mean fewer people exposed to air pollution.
Because of the health threat from diesel fumes, many environmental justice advocates are calling for school districts to commit to electric buses. Lonnie Portis of WE ACT, a Harlem-based environmental justice organization, said that polluting facilities like bus depots are frequently placed in communities of color and low-income communities. “There’s nonstop exhaust and fumes, which are absolutely horrible,” Portis said. “You have these kids of color and school kids in general having to take these buses and inhale all this pollution. We know that young lungs are very different from adult lungs. The exhaust creates or exacerbates asthma. Going electric is a great way to remove one of those cumulative impacts from these communities of color.”
Last year, New York City committed to transition to a 100% electric school bus fleet by 2035. Prince George’s County, just outside Washington, DC, has committed to an all-electric school bus fleet by 2040.
Ramón Palencia-Calvo of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters said that when his organization started its Chispa Maryland program to engage Latino residents on environmental issues, air quality was quickly identified as a top priority because of high levels of childhood asthma. In addition to health concerns, he said asthma creates economic hardship because families can struggle to pay for medication and parents can miss work when a child is sick. “On top of that, there’s the emotional toll on the family knowing that your kid or your sibling has to suffer with asthma and cannot go outside when other kids are playing outside,” Palencia-Calvo said.
When money became available from the Volkswagen emissions legal settlement, advocates urged Maryland to use some of its share for electric buses. ""We said, let’s make sure it benefits the people who need it the most—communities overburdened by pollution,"" Palencia-Calvo said. In 2019, Prince George’s County received $340,000 from the settlement for electric school buses. Now Palencia-Calvo's organization wants Maryland to seek federal infrastructure money for electric school buses.
The bipartisan infrastructure law passed by Congress last year provides $2.5 billion for zero- emissions school buses powered by electricity, to be dispersed over five years. Another $2.5 billion is available to transition bus fleets from diesel to electricity or other fuels. Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean School Bus Program is prioritizing school districts in low-income communities, some rural areas, and certain schools serving Native Americans. Assistance for schools and communities to navigate this opportunity will help ensure that these new federal funds protect health and produce long-term benefits.
A growing number of communities in the United States are looking to tap utility or government funding to electrify school buses, according to the World Resources Institute. Across 36 states, 354 school districts have announced plans to purchase more than 1,800 electric school buses.
As the electric grid transitions to cleaner sources of power, replacing diesel buses with electric models will not only reduce air pollutants, but will also cut greenhouse gas emissions. Diesel vehicles are responsible for 26% of U.S. transportation-sector greenhouse gas emissions and 9% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The federal money for electric buses will allow school districts to improve students’ health while lessening their climate impact.

Biden’s Proposed Phaseout of Inefficient Furnaces Would Cut Costs and Emissions;"Washington, DC—The Biden administration today proposed to phase out the most inefficient gas furnaces, which would significantly reduce household costs and climate-warming emissions. The plan arrives as millions of U.S. families may face a spike in gas prices for home heating later this year spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that its landmark efficiency standard for home furnaces—potentially the first meaningful update in 35 years—would reduce costs for each affected household by nearly $500 over the life of a furnace and cut 373 million metric tons of carbon emissions over 30 years of sales. The standard also would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, which cause asthma attacks, cardiovascular disease, and even premature death.
“Home heating bills strain the budgets of many households, especially those with low incomes, yet we’re still installing brand-new furnace models that waste a lot of the heat. The Biden administration is right to phase out the most inefficient models,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “We’ve had far-more-efficient options available for years now. The new standard would reduce needless costs and greenhouse gas emissions.”
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said: “At a time when global gas markets are in turmoil, this is a good step to help protect millions of families against price spikes that can send bills through the roof.” Nadel continued, “We’re one big step closer to finally moving past outdated furnace technology. The administration deserves kudos for stepping up with a strong proposal here. Now they’ll need to move promptly and get the job done.”
Nearly half of U.S. homes—about 50 million—are heated with a gas or propane furnace. Households with inefficient (“non-condensing”) gas furnaces face annual average heating bills of about $700. And bills can be much higher in older homes that tend to be less well insulated, or those in colder climates. 
Manufacturers have developed substantially more-efficient models—known as condensing furnaces—that capture and use more of the heat from the furnace’s combustion chamber, thereby reducing waste. About half of new purchases are now condensing models, but many consumers still end up with the non-condensing models because that’s often what a landlord or a builder chooses—or because a homeowner had to make a quick decision when replacing a broken furnace in the winter.
The standard proposed by DOE would require furnaces to use about 15% less energy than today’s most wasteful models, effectively phasing out non-condensing models. DOE estimates that with the new standards, the vast majority of consumers who would’ve purchased a non-condensing furnace would instead purchase a condensing furnace, while most of the remainder would purchase an electric heat pump. By law, the standard could not take effect until five years after it is finalized.
Furnace efficiency standards have not been meaningfully updated since they were set by Congress in 1987. DOE made a slight update in 2007, but to an efficiency level that 99% of models already met. DOE issued a stronger standard in 2011, but a gas utility trade association sued the department on procedural grounds; DOE settled in 2014 and agreed to redo the standard.
In 2018, gas utilities petitioned DOE to issue a rule that would prevent the department from later setting strong standards for gas products, including furnaces. DOE finalized such a rule in January 2021 in the final days of the Trump administration, and then undid the action in December 2021 after the Biden administration reviewed the record on the earlier action; the gas utilities subsequently sued the department over that most recent action. That litigation remains pending.
Federal law requires DOE to periodically review standards for furnaces and other products; under the court-approved settlement in 2014, DOE was supposed to finalize a new furnace standard by 2016.

New NY Appliance Efficiency Bill Will Save Consumers Money and Cut Climate Emissions;"The New York legislature last night passed a sweeping bill to slash climate-change emissions and save New Yorkers hundreds of millions of dollars annually on their utility bills by requiring appliances to be more energy efficient. The bill, the most expansive of any recently passed by a state, now goes to Governor Kathy Hochul for her signature.
The bill will apply to many common household products, including computers and televisions. It calls for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to update energy and water efficiency standards for 7 products already regulated by the state and to set new standards for another 30, including air purifiers, electric vehicle chargers, and restaurant equipment.
Potential new standards are estimated to save New Yorkers $800 million annually on utility bills by 2025, rising to $1.3 billion per year by 2030, according to a 2021 report prepared by NYSERDA and the New York Department of State. They are expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 1.2 million metric tons in 2025, equivalent to taking 370,000 cars off the road for a year.
The legislation, sponsored by Senator Kevin Parker and Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy, will also allow regulators to set energy codes for new houses and commercial buildings that exceed national model codes. When assessing whether a building code is cost-effective, regulators would consider lifetime building energy savings, rather than looking only at a 10-year window, as is currently the case.
New York will be one of three states, along with California and Connecticut, to give a state agency broad regulatory authority to ensure appliance standards keep pace with technological advancements. In addition to directing NYSERDA to consider standards for a long list of specific products, the bill empowers the agency to establish new efficiency standards and promulgate regulations, including for products not listed.
The California Energy Commission has used its authority to issue nation-leading standards, and NYSERDA could do the same for New York with this new bill.
The bill directs NYSERDA to consider energy reduction, water conservation, greenhouse gas reductions, and increased demand flexibility when setting appliance standards. Demand flexibility requirements could ensure that water heaters, for example, come factory-equipped with technology enabling consumers to participate in programs to preheat water when electricity is cheapest, such as at night.
In just the past few years, 13 states plus the District of Columbia have adopted new appliance efficiency standards, including Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont in the Northeast.

Biden Could Save Families Thousands on Energy Bills with Efficiency Rules for U.S.-Backed Home Loans;"Washington, DC—The Biden administration could save many low- and moderate-income households thousands of dollars—and cut greenhouse gas emissions—by updating energy efficiency requirements for new federally supported homes, according to a study today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
Congress directed federal agencies to periodically update efficiency criteria for new homes purchased with the support of federally backed mortgages and federal housing programs. But the regulators have not updated the criteria for most of the homes since 2015. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) pledged in July 2021 to take a key step toward updating the standards by the end of that year, but it has not yet done so.
The ACEEE study finds that updating the standards could save the average household in a federally supported single-family home nearly $2,800 in reduced energy bills, net of costs. And they could yield more than $5,700 in total net savings per household when including other benefits of improved homes, such as better health outcomes. The calculations were based over 30 years.
“Right now, taxpayer dollars are helping people get homes that just aren’t built to modern standards, and it leaves residents—often low- and moderate-income families—paying needlessly high energy bills,” said Steven Nadel, ACEEE executive director. “The good news is that Congress actually figured out years ago that there need to be some minimum efficiency standards for these homes. But it’s up to the Biden administration to get the update done.”
The study finds updated efficiency criteria would save households more in energy costs than they would increase mortgage payments, and could result in the following economic impacts for households in new federally supported homes:
The initial cost is the added cost of efficiency measures in a new home. Owners of single-family homes would recoup the added down payment (10% of the initial cost) after about two years (time to positive cash flow); paybacks would be even faster for the average apartment. Nonenergy benefits (including health benefits) are assumed to be equal to 50% of the energy bill savings and are included in the lifetime net benefits but not in the financial-only savings; both are discounted net present value.
In addition to the household savings, the study finds that updated efficiency requirements for federally supported homes could:
 Avoid 275 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions (cumulatively), equivalent to the emissions from 59 million cars and light trucks for a year
Create 838,000 jobs (net added job-years)
Generate $27 billion in total net savings (present value)
These nationwide numbers include the impacts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—federally chartered companies regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency—adopting similar criteria for new homes with loans they finance.
Congress authorized the efficiency requirements—in bipartisan legislation passed in 1992 and revised in 2007—to ensure that federally supported homes do not burden residents with high energy costs. Updating the standards would ensure that the new homes have more insulation, are less drafty, have better lighting, and potentially have far-more-efficient water heaters or use heat pumps.
The law requires HUD and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to update their criteria to match updated model building energy codes upon a determination that doing so would not negatively affect the availability or affordability of covered housing. Currently, HUD and USDA will need to issue a draft determination, solicit comment, and then issue a final determination; they haven’t yet issued the draft.
The single-family homes at issue in the law include new homes with loan guarantees or insured loans through Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and USDA mortgages, and to a lesser extent through HUD grant programs. A separate law requires Department of Veterans Affairs loan criteria based on the HUD-USDA provision. Such homes make up about 19% of all new single-family homes, ACEEE found.
The law also applies efficiency criteria to homes in multifamily buildings, including those with FHA mortgages and to new and rehabilitated units with support from HUD programs such as HOME Investment Partnerships grants for affordable housing, Rental Assistance Demonstration funding that is used to convert public housing to privately owned affordable rental properties, and public housing. Combined, the new homes in these categories represent about 13% of all new units in multifamily buildings in recent years.

Energy-Efficient Cars Save Travelers Big Bucks on Road Trips;"With Memorial Day and the summer driving season upon us, gasoline prices—now averaging $4.60 per gallon for regular—will seriously jack up the cost of a road trip. A fuel-efficient car reduces those costs, saving hundreds of dollars on long rides.  
In fact, travelers save nearly $550 by driving the most fuel-efficient 2022 midsize sedan—the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid Blue—rather than the least-efficient 2022 midsize SUV—the Jeep Wrangler 4X4—one way from New York to San Francisco, according to an analysis of ACEEE’s GreenerCars data.  
Even on shorter trips, consumers benefit. By making the above vehicle switch, they save nearly $70 in gasoline costs on a one-way trip from Indianapolis to Pittsburgh.  
Of course, staying home can reduce these costs (and related greenhouse gas emissions) the most, but many people are eager to travel more after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking a bus or train will usually reduce emissions, but it may not always be a viable or cost-effective option. 
A fuel-efficient vehicle reduces both gasoline costs and emissions. Because of supply chain disruptions, consumers may not be able to buy or rent the most energy-efficient options, which often include all-electric, plug-in hybrid, or gasoline hybrid vehicles. Still, they can lower operating costs by picking the most efficient option available. 
Smaller cars often get more miles per gallon (mpg) than larger ones. Yet as the graphic below and ACEEE’s GreenerCars ratings show, huge variations exist within the same vehicle class. The most fuel-efficient midsize car, for example, gets more than twice as many mpg as the Cadillac CT5 V, the least efficient mass-market midsize sedan. 
Note: This analysis uses the most direct driving routes and the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline, per AAA, as of May 25, 2022. It compares gas-fueled vehicles. *The Toyota Venza AWD and Lexus 350h AWD also get 37 mpg on a highway. 
Source: ACEEE’s GreenerCars  
The good news: Most of the “greenest” vehicles on ACEEE’s annual GreenerCars ratings are moderately priced. The most fuel-efficient midsize sedan, the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid Blue, has prices starting at just under $25,000.  
The other good news: The availability of public charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid cars, though still spotty and uneven in parts of the United States, has improved. In addition, the driving range has improved for many newer EVs, allowing consumers to go farther on a single charge. 
Travelers can now take these vehicles on road trips. Monique Hanis, a retiree in Arlington, VA, and her husband drove a plug-in electric hybrid round-trip from Virginia to California last fall, stopping at eight national parks and other tourist sites along the way. They often used public EV charging stations and dramatically reduced the gasoline costs of the 8,000-mile trip.  
Aside from vehicle efficiency, local gas prices also affect the cost of a road trip.  
While $4.60 is the average cost of a gallon of regular gas in the United States as of May 25, costs range significantly—from a low of $4.37 in North Carolina to a high of $6.07 in California, according to AAA. The average price is up about 50% from a year ago.

Biden Standard for Manufactured Homes Will Leave Low-Income Households with High Energy Bills;"Washington, DC—Biden administration standards for manufactured homes will boost the efficiency of more than half of new units, but in a major shortcoming, will require little improvement for smaller models, leaving future low-income residents with high energy bills.
Finalized today, the long-awaited standards from the Department of Energy (DOE) will require a majority of new manufactured homes (often known as mobile homes) to have significantly more insulation than they must today, as well as other energy-efficiency improvements. But all of the homes will still be allowed to be far less efficient than site-built homes in states with up-to-date codes. And the smaller “single-wide” models delivered on a truck in just one section—representing about 45% of today’s new manufactured homes—may still be made with only thin insulation or with single-pane windows. The efficiency requirements for those homes will be only slightly stronger than those in place since 1994.
“Residents of poorly insulated manufactured homes have paid high energy bills for far too long. This rule gives manufacturers the green light to keep building models with the same problems,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “It’s going to leave many of the lowest-income households paying painfully high utility bills for even more years to come. Going forward the administration certainly shouldn’t make a habit of letting manufacturers make more-wasteful homes and products for lower-income people.”
Manufactured homes are a critical type of affordable housing; a majority of households who live in them have incomes under two times the federal poverty level. But the homes often waste large amounts of energy because of limited insulation and outdated windows and heating equipment. Energy costs are about 70% more per square foot in these homes compared to site-built homes, and a quarter of their residents spend more than 10% of their income on energy costs, ACEEE has found.
The new standards—based off a proposal from DOE last year—will save consumers $5.06 billion in costs (present value at 3% discount rate, net after added investments) and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80.4 million metric tons over 30 years, according to DOE.
DOE’s own analysis found that a stronger standard—requiring similar improvements for all models—would have reduced residents’ overall costs over time, as the upfront costs would be exceeded by the reduced energy bills. An ACEEE study published in February found that the lowest-income residents—who are rarely the first purchasers of the homes—would particularly benefit from a stronger standard ensuring all new units are significantly more efficient.
Background:
Approximately 6.8 million manufactured homes are used as residences in the United States; in 2021, 105,772 new manufactured homes were shipped, about 7% of all new homes.
State or municipal building energy codes cover most new home construction, but the federal government regulates manufactured homes, which are made in facilities that may ship to multiple states. The Department of Housing and Urban Development sets a building code for the homes, but it has not updated the energy provisions since 1994.
Recognizing the need to reduce energy waste in these homes, Congress—in a bipartisan energy bill in 2007—directed DOE to develop and finalize a separate energy standard for manufactured homes by 2011 based on the most recent model energy code for site-built homes (now the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code). The Sierra Club sued DOE over its failure to publish a rule by the 2011 legal deadline; the department agreed in a settlement to sign a final rule by May 16, 2022.

Study: Energy Scores in Rental Listings Could Steer Renters to Homes with Lower Utility Bills;"Washington, DC—Prospective renters would be more likely to choose an energy-efficient home if they could compare rental units’ energy costs, according to a first-of-its-kind experiment. The study, published today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), shows that local or state policies requiring landlords to disclose efficiency information in rental listings could help tenants find lower-cost housing and spur building owners to make energy-saving improvements.
In the United States, renters searching for homes almost never know how much they will have to pay in energy costs, which are now rising. This is a particular challenge for low-income households, who are more likely to rent than own and pay a higher percentage of their income on energy bills. Only a few cities in the United States require building owners to disclose energy information to renters, and none require disclosure at the time of listing.
Register now for the report webinar today, May 17, at 1:00 p.m. ET
In ACEEE’s study, participants using a mock real estate listing website—unknowingly being tested for their reaction to the energy information included—were more likely to choose rental homes with high efficiency ratings or low energy costs.
“How can renters possibly make informed decisions about which home to live in without being able to compare what their utility bills will be?” said Reuven Sussman, lead author of the report and director of the behavior and human dimensions program at ACEEE. “Our experiment showed that if renters have that energy cost or efficiency rating, it’s absolutely going to affect their choices. It may also nudge landlords to make their buildings more efficient.”
ACEEE hired a panel research firm to recruit a nationally representative sample of 2,455 renters to participate in a discrete choice experiment conducted through a mock rental listing website. Study participants “searched” for a home, specifying preferences including location, property type (house or apartment), number of bedrooms, and monthly rent. They were then shown three search results at a time and asked to select the rental unit they liked the most within each set.
A sample apartment listing used in the experiment, in this case showing a Building Energy Score displayed via text.
Some participants saw information about the units’ energy efficiency, presented in one of six possible formats, while those in a control group saw no energy information—as nearly all real-world renters currently experience with actual listings. When energy labels were present, renters selected the most efficient listings 21% more often than when energy efficiency information was hidden. On average, renters were willing to increase their monthly rent by 1.8% for a one-unit increase in energy score (on a scale from 1 to 10), which would translate into more than $400 of additional annual revenue for landlords for an average-priced rental unit.
The study also found that the way the energy information was presented mattered. Presenting energy labels for only the most efficient homes did not encourage study participants to choose them. For this reason, the study recommends that voluntary labeling should be only a stepping stone toward energy disclosure in all real estate listings. Local and state governments should require landlords to disclose this information.
Presenting energy information to renters through an intuitive scoring system is key. The study found that showing an energy rating along a continuum or simply as a score out of 10—helping renters understand how each unit compares to the best and worst homes—is more effective than showing this information without context.
An example of an energy score displayed along a continuum—which proved effective for influencing potential renters’ choices
“You need to give prospective renters the basic energy information, but just as important, you need to display it to them in a way that gives them context and allows them to make a comparison,” said Hannah Bastian, report coauthor and ACEEE senior research analyst.
The study builds on previous ACEEE research on energy labels for home buyers. Rental properties consume more energy per square foot than owner-occupied homes and are more likely to be occupied by low-income tenants and members of racial and ethnic minority groups. One challenge is that neither landlords nor renters have much incentive to invest in efficiency upgrades—landlords generally aren’t the ones paying the energy bills, and renters might move out before the investments pay themselves back through savings.
ACEEE’s findings point to an opportunity to incentivize efficiency upgrades. While the current lack of information available to renters prevents the rental market from accurately accounting for the value of energy efficiency, energy labeling could motivate landlords to improve the efficiency of their residential units—cutting renters’ costs and, by reducing energy waste, helping combat the climate crisis.

Here’s How to Scale Energy-Saving Commercial Building Retrofits;"Comprehensive retrofits of commercial buildings can reduce their energy use by up to 40% but are not happening anywhere near the scale needed to meet climate goals, according to a report released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). With new federal funds available for such energy-saving upgrades, the report offers a roadmap for how utilities and policymakers can start or expand robust retrofit programs that include more than just lighting.
The research finds that more utility programs have emerged in recent years to offer “deep” or “comprehensive” commercial retrofits. These retrofits include multiple energy efficiency measures that often upgrade heating, cooling, lighting, and other systems. Yet there are still far too few of these programs, which deliver energy savings 2.5 to 7 times greater than approaches involving single measures such as lighting—often the easiest step.
Deep retrofits are critical for climate action. More than half of U.S. commercial buildings were built before 2000. They do not meet today’s more efficient codes and often lack products and technologies that can save the most energy. Even many newer buildings that comply with more-recent codes do not perform as intended, either due to faulty installation, lack of maintenance, or normal wear and tear.
In today’s report, which updates earlier research, ACEEE analyzes 50 utility programs in the United States to identify and recommend approaches for retrofitting commercial buildings. Many of these programs offer limited data because they are still in early stages or the COVID-19 pandemic slowed their progress. As a result, most program data are from 2018 or 2019. Because many programs are still new, determining their success will require additional time and data.
Overall, we see that utilities have made progress and use a variety of strategies to improve their programs. Several good practices highlighted in ACEEE’s 2014 analysis, such as offering low-cost energy assessments and collecting energy-use data, are now the basis for identifying and assessing program savings. ACEEE also explored the issue in a 2005 report.
These programs help customers design, finance, and implement deep retrofits of commercial buildings. They also help assess and verify the expected levels of energy savings, which range from 10% to 40%.
  We group programs with the above scope of services into five categories, each with varying strengths: (1) existing-building commissioning (EBCx) with recommendations for capital improvements, (2) custom programs, (3) performance-based programs, (4) programs based on energy consumption patterns, and (5) programs encouraging high-performance certifications.
The report includes cases studies of programs that are overcoming barriers to comprehensive retrofits. For example, Pacific Gas & Electric’s Whole Building Performance Based Program Offering quantifies savings at the meter, overcoming challenges around measuring the energy reductions from multi-measure projects.
Another example is Seattle City Light’s Energy Efficiency as a Service pilot. The program uses service agreements to deliver deep energy retrofits, requiring participating buildings to reduce electricity consumption by at least 25%. The pilot tests a way to address the problem of split incentives—the discrepancy between the party that pays for the retrofit and the party that financially benefits from it. Split incentives prevent building owners from investing in deep retrofits.
We find that programs based on performance or energy consumption patterns can scale comprehensive retrofits but are often more administratively complex and costly to implement. We also find that programs collaborating with existing market providers are likely to see greater participation.
Our research shows that programs must communicate a deep retrofit’s full range of benefits in ways that captivate consumers and motivate them to go beyond single-measure upgrades. We identify eight effective strategies that program administrators can adopt to help comprehensive retrofit programs best serve their customers.   
Secure funding. Combining federal, state, and local funding can help develop new programs and expand existing ones.
Offer a one-stop service. Designing programs to offer one-stop service including energy assessments, financing options, technical assistance, and post-installation follow-up can ensure continuous savings.
Redesign customer incentives. Providing upfront and performance-based incentives, rebates, and financing options for comprehensive retrofits can help customers overcome initial and total project cost barriers.
Bundle and stage measures. Bundling a combination of measures with long-term paybacks and short-term paybacks can create an acceptable return and much higher value for customers. Splitting a retrofit into stages can make the process and the investment less overwhelming.
Deploy new technologies. Creating a package that incorporates energy-saving measures and grid-interactive efficient building technologies can drive additional savings and demand reductions. The technologies may vary based on customer needs and utility program goals.
Develop a network of partners. Identifying key partnerships can enable utilities to offer turnkey services and increase program participation and success.
Improve access to meter data and enable analytics. Accelerating the deployment of analytical tools that leverage smart meters and data management systems can provide better visibility into building operations and improve accuracy of measurement and verification.
Increase participation by noting multiple benefits. Characterizing and quantifying the multiple benefits from comprehensive retrofits can further outreach to decision makers, get more buildings to do retrofits, and provide policymakers compelling evidence of the value of comprehensive retrofits in meeting city, state, and federal energy and climate goals.

To Decarbonize Industry at Needed Pace, the Energy Department Should Reimagine Its Efforts;"Congress has recently infused the Department of Energy (DOE) with new funds aimed at cutting carbon emissions from American industry—but is the agency prepared to meet this challenge at the rapid pace needed to avert the worst impacts of climate change? And can DOE drive the deployment of transformative technologies at scale?
DOE has a proven history of funding critical research that has helped industry use energy more efficiently. Now, it must move faster and intensify its work on technology implementation to help industry reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.
In a white paper released today, ACEEE offers a range of ideas that DOE could use as it reimagines its approach to industrial decarbonization. The agency’s new funding—from the bipartisan infrastructure law and Energy Act of 2020, with potentially more on the way—needs to be applied in new ways—and fast—to meet the climate challenge.
Basic research is important, but technology deployment is crucial
In recent years, DOE’s work in the industrial sector—which is primarily through its Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO)—has become heavily focused on research. Working together, AMO and the new Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains need to drive a more applied focus that supports not only research but also implementation at companies eager to invest in low-carbon technologies.
Why is the current approach inadequate? Take the case of AMO’s research on industrial heat pumps (IHPs). In the 1980s and 1990s, AMO helped enable their development. Today, a number of European and Japanese companies are using IHPs in industrial processes to provide heat in a cleaner manner than through traditional methods (the subject of a recent ACEEE report). This is due in large part to the continued support in those countries for IHP capability advancement and deployment. But few U.S. industries are using the technology. The AMO program focused on development but not applications at scale, and it was dropped decades ago.
While federal agencies in Germany and other European countries have supported industries in advancing IHPs—and especially in deploying the technology—there’s been no similar effort in the United States. In other words, research alone is not enough.
DOE should broaden its focus on technology deployment, scale, and dispersion of low-carbon technologies across industries and applications. While the agency currently works closely with a modest number of industrial companies, it will need to deepen those partnerships and expand its efforts to engage a larger and more varied set of companies across heavy and light industry.
Leveraging funding to expand impact
DOE’s funding for AMO has roughly doubled in the past few years. That’s a welcome investment from Congress. But consider the scale of the challenge: industry currently accounts for about one-quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and it will take trillions of dollars to decarbonize all industrial sectors. Transformative decarbonization technologies—think a direct reduction iron facility or an electric ethane cracker in the chemical industry—can take a billion dollars or more for a single project. In this light, even AMO’s expanded funding is quite modest.
AMO can and must make its dollars go further. It could package projects to better attract outside financing, including by providing in-kind services with partners and national labs to lower technical hurdles for companies, encouraging them to take on decarbonization projects that they otherwise would not.
DOE and AMO can leverage commercial financing, philanthropy, green bonds, and economic or community development funds. In Canada, for example, the multinational ELYSIS zero-carbon aluminum initiative combines funding from Apple, Rio Tinto, ALCOA, and Canadian federal and provincial governments.
Rising to the challenge
AMO should scale up its vision, capabilities, and responsiveness to enable the dramatic changes needed in industry to achieve both energy and GHG reductions. It can tap its 35-year portfolio of technologies, practices, and industrial partnerships to spur adoption of transformative low-carbon technologies. 
A reimagined DOE and AMO can more extensively partner with industrial players, public and private finance, and other agencies to catalyze change with speed and scale while developing a diverse workforce, improving competitiveness, and strengthening resilience. We call on DOE to take on the challenge, drive breakthroughs in low-carbon deployment, scale up at an accelerated pace, and tailor its approach to engage a deeper and wider portion of U.S. industry.

The Benefits and Administrative Costs of Local Building Efficiency Policies: Q&A;"As cities work to meet their climate commitments, they are increasingly adopting policies to reduce existing buildings’ greenhouse gas emissions and energy use. Despite this encouraging progress, cities considering adopting these policies still have limited data available on the costs to run these programs or the benefits of doing so. An ACEEE topic brief and accompanying fact sheets released today share new data—and insights some cities have learned about designing and implementing such policies.
The brief and fact sheet series are based on ACEEE’s interviews with nine cities that have efficiency policies for existing buildings, including policies requiring owners of single-family homes to provide prospective buyers with energy information (time-of-sale disclosure policies), building owners to make certain tune-ups (retrocommissioning or tune-up policies), or building owners to track and disclose energy use to the municipality (benchmarking policies).
We chatted with Alexander Jarrah, lead researcher and ACEEE research analyst for local policy, to learn more.
Why did you focus on these particular policies? What is their importance for cities?
These policies are important tools for cities for several reasons, ranging from reducing energy use, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions to offering consumer protections for renters and homebuyers seeking properties with more affordable energy bills. Such policies can prompt building owners to pursue energy efficiency upgrades and participate in incentive programs. A growing number of U.S. cities are adopting these policies, and we’ve heard from several others wanting to know about the costs and benefits involved.
Looking at these policies as a whole, how would you summarize their costs to cities?
There are real costs to cities, many of which are resource constrained, but your perspective matters. In too many cases, sustainability offices have small staffs and are tasked with doing more with less. If you are thinking in terms of a city’s sustainability office budget, the costs of designing and implementing these policies can be significant. But when compared to a city’s overall budget, they are really fairly modest. Some cities will need to increase their budget to design and run these policies. We believe it’s a manageable amount for many, though. And frankly, to run programs that achieve energy savings and greenhouse gas reductions, cities inherently need to make some level of additional investment.
Designing these policies generally costs more than implementing them. One of the highest costs for cities is the required staff time. The cities we interviewed used 1 to 2.5 full-time equivalent employees during the design phase, but that number went down during implementation. Some cities hire consultants, which can be costly. IT support is another cost for implementing some policies, like benchmarking. To help with costs, cities can often take advantage of opportunities to receive low- or no-cost support from nonprofits, national labs, and other organizations.
You found that the cities implementing these policies have been tracking their benefits only in limited ways. Can you explain why that’s the case and what we know about the benefits?
Cities need to be diligent about how they spend time and funds, and most are going to prioritize implementation of a policy over evaluation. The policies we looked at take different levels of commitment to evaluate. Evaluating time-of-sale disclosure policies for greenhouse gas emissions reductions would require a lot of time and effort on the city’s part, for example, and so these are less commonly evaluated.
In those few cities that are tracking benefits, we see that benchmarking and retrocommissioning policies can result in greenhouse gas emissions reductions of more than 5% in compliant buildings. Other benefits cities reported included job creation and reductions in energy use and costs.
Do we know if these policies are achieving equitable outcomes by benefiting marginalized community residents?
There’s not much information on how these policies are benefiting marginalized groups. Because of concerns among some that the policies would increase rent prices, a number of the cities we looked at exclude the multifamily and affordable housing sectors from new efficiency requirements altogether. That’s not the best approach, as it restricts or eliminates the potential for the policies’ benefits to reach these residents, who are some of the most in need of these benefits. For example, the median energy burden of low-income households is 3.5 times higher than that of non-low-income households. Cities can better address this issue by offering these sectors financial assistance, relaxed compliance schedules, and support with compliance to address affordability concerns.
What are some trends or similarities in the ways cities implement their policies?
Cities find that creating lists of the buildings covered by the policies is essential for benchmarking and retrocommissioning policies. This can be a time- and labor-intensive process, but indicating which buildings need to comply with the policy and which are exempt is an important step that helps with compliance. Cities also need to stay on top of buildings’ points of contact, as these can change frequently. Several cities we looked at used spreadsheets to manage data collection at first but soon realized that this wasn’t the best way to go. Many switched to more advanced—and costlier—software, such as customer relationship management programs with more functionality. And another trend we found is that cities often assist resource-constrained building owners, such as nonprofit organizations and houses of worship.
What advice would you give cities considering these policies?
There are a few things they can keep in mind. Some cities we interviewed noted that it’s helpful to keep elements related to implementation out of the legislation language. This allows more flexibility in the rulemaking process, and the simplified legislation can result in increased compliance. Second, the number of full-time equivalent employees dedicated to implementing the policy was insufficient in some cities, so if you’re a city considering one of these policies, it’s worth planning for scenarios where you’ll need to hire additional staff. Third, committing to program evaluation early on will allow you to begin to identify which processes need to change. Lastly, as we’ve already discussed, providing support to the multifamily and affordable housing sectors can help residents in these buildings reap the benefits of these policies.

U.S. Light Bulb Standards Will Cut Utility Bills and Climate Emissions;"Washington, DC—Light bulb efficiency standards announced today by the Biden administration will phase out energy-wasting bulbs, significantly reducing many households’ electric bills and averting needless greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The rules from the Department of Energy (DOE) will ensure that commonly used light bulbs, including the iconic pear-shaped ones, meet an efficiency standard easily achieved by today’s LEDs.
The new standards will save consumers nearly $3 billion annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 222 million metric tons over 30 years, according to DOE. The efficiency standard—mandated in a 2007 law—had been set to take effect in 2020, but the Trump administration prevented it from doing so after a trade group representing major light bulb manufacturers sued the government and urged it to not implement the standard.
“This is a victory for consumers and for the climate, one that’s been a long time coming,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “LEDs have become so inexpensive that there’s no good reason for manufacturers to keep selling 19th-century technology that just isn’t very good at turning electrical energy into light. These standards will finally phase out energy-wasting bulbs across the country.”
Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), said: “It’s going to save people money because running a few dozen bulbs that waste most of the energy as heat really adds up. The administration is allowing retailers to keep selling the inefficient bulbs well into 2023, but responsible chains ought to get them off their shelves as soon as possible and certainly by the end of this year. Many of these energy-guzzling bulbs have labels claiming they save energy, and it’s infuriating. People and the climate have paid the price.”
In an enforcement policy statement accompanying the rule, DOE said it will effectively allow companies to import noncompliant bulbs until January 2023, and allow retailers to continue selling them until July 2023.
While Sweden-based Ikea switched to selling only LEDs in 2015, including in U.S. stores, nearly all major retailers are still selling incandescent or halogen incandescent bulbs. These include Walmart, Amazon, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Target.
While sales of LEDs have increased rapidly, about 30% of light bulbs sold in the United States in 2020 were still incandescent or halogen incandescent bulbs, which turn most of the electrical energy they use into heat, not light. Most retailers have greatly expanded their LED options but continue to stock inefficient bulbs, which are often particularly prominent at dollar stores and convenience stores.
Each additional month that inefficient light bulbs are widely sold in the United States costs consumers nearly $300 million in needless energy bills and causes 800,000 tons of preventable carbon dioxide emissions over the short lifetime of the bulbs sold in that month.
One of the two rules finalized today requires that bulbs produce at least 45 lumens per watt (a measure of how much visible light is produced for a given amount of electrical power). Congress had mandated in a bipartisan 2007 law that such a standard—a “backstop”—was to go into effect automatically on January 1, 2020, if DOE did not develop and finalize a standard at that level or higher by certain deadlines. The Obama administration’s DOE determined the legal backstop had been triggered, but the Trump administration effectively undid that action, arguing that the backstop had not in fact been triggered.
The second rule ensures that the new efficiency standard covers not only pear-shaped A-type bulbs but several other common types, such as reflector bulbs used in recessed and track lighting, candle-shaped bulbs used in wall fixtures and other decorative light fixtures, and globe-shaped bulbs often installed in bathrooms. LEDs are now widely available for each of these bulb types, which collectively make up about 40% of the light bulbs in use. The Obama administration had determined that these types should be covered, but the Trump administration also undid that action.

Affordable Housing Lags Behind in Decarbonization Programs;"The affordable housing sector stands to miss out on the many benefits of electrification and decarbonization, as few utility programs target its particular needs and challenges, according to a report released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
The research shows that utilities are starting to support home electrification—essential for reducing climate-warming emissions—but still have few programs to help the affordable housing sector. Such existing programs tend to be single demonstration projects or pilot programs, not full-scale programs serving large customer populations. Electrification in homes involves replacing equipment that uses fossil fuels, such as natural gas, propane, or heating oil, with technologies that use electricity, preferably from renewable sources. For heating and hot water, this means heat pumps instead of fossil-fuel furnaces and water heaters. For cooking, this means induction stoves instead of gas ranges and ovens.
Two-pronged approach must include efficiency
Our report recommends a two-pronged approach to decarbonizing affordable housing: (1) improving the energy efficiency of the building shell, equipment, and systems, and (2) converting equipment from fossil fuel-dependent to electric (i.e., electrification). In cold climates, some use of fuels may be needed when temperatures get very low. Together these strategies can have the largest impact for reducing carbon emissions, particularly as utilities shift away from fossil fuel electric generation to renewable, no-carbon generation such as wind and solar.
Low- and moderate-income households stand to gain several benefits from electrification and improved energy efficiency, including lower monthly utility bills and energy burdens. Eliminating the combustion of fossil fuels yields health and safety benefits, especially for people with respiratory conditions. Installing heat pumps to replace existing heating equipment can also provide air-conditioning—a potentially life-saving upgrade for homes not already air-conditioned—as more regions face deadly heat waves, as in the Pacific Northwest in 2021. And should the power go out, a home that is well sealed and insulated will maintain habitable temperatures for longer during temperature extremes.
Barriers to decarbonization in older buildings
Decarbonizing affordable housing—largely defined as serving low- and moderate-income households—is challenging, particularly for existing buildings. Electrifying existing fossil fuel technologies, such as furnaces, boilers, or water heaters, can require costly upgrades and modifications, such as increasing electric wiring capacity. Electrification in new construction does not pose such barriers and is typically no more expensive than installing fossil-fuel equipment and systems. While the number of residential electrification programs is growing rapidly, few are designed for affordable housing.
Another barrier is unfamiliarity with electric technologies, such as heat pumps and induction stoves. This applies both to customers and contractors. In cold climates especially, customers may be unaware that heat pumps can indeed maintain comfortable indoor temperatures during extremely cold winter weather. Contractors may be unfamiliar with how to correctly size and maintain heat pumps. Therefore, market adoption has been slow, although today’s cold-climate heat pumps are capable of meeting heating demands in most regions.

Emerging policies and programs showing the way
A leading example of a statewide decarbonization program targeting multifamily properties with low-income residents is California’s Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP), one of the largest building electrification efforts in the United States. Since its beginning in 2016, LIWP has delivered more than $33 million in incentives based on avoided greenhouse gas emissions for more than 8,100 low-income rental households. Building retrofits include insulation; air and duct sealing; electrification of space heating, hot water, and cooking; and distributed energy resources including rooftop and community solar.
Some cities are taking similar actions but at a smaller scale. In 2021 the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority announced a forthcoming $24 million pilot program in partnership with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development to fund electrification in affordable housing in New York City. This partnership aims to deliver all-electric retrofit upgrades to 1,200 units
At the utility level, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) plans to reach 100% carbon-free power by 2030. To that end, it offers several incentive programs and partnerships to help different segments of the affordable housing sector. SMUD’s Sustainable Communities initiative involves partnerships with key community groups like Habitat for Humanity, the Sacramento Housing & Redevelopment Agency, and the Mutual Housing Fund. By combining resources and adequately funding these initiatives, SMUD can effectively support electrification measures such as heat pumps, water heaters, and induction stoves for many low-income units in its service territory.
The federal government has long been a leader and major funder for energy efficiency programs serving low-income customers, largely through the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). In March of this year, the Biden administration announced $3.16 billion in newly available funding for home retrofits and electrification through WAP. As part of the infrastructure bill passed by Congress in 2021, this funding will enable WAP to retrofit about 450,000 homes to improve their energy efficiency and replace fossil-fuel equipment with electric alternatives.
Enabling all households to fight climate change and reap the rewards
Decarbonization initiatives should take advantage of multiple opportunities (city, state, federal, utility incentives, financing) to leverage available resources. Collaboration among the many affordable housing stakeholders is also critical to apply organizational knowledge, relationships, skills, and experience. Retrofitting for decarbonization is essential to meet climate targets and ensure that the benefits of decarbonization are shared by all customers.

U.S. Cities Aren’t Adequately Enabling Alternatives to Driving. These Policies Could Help;"This blog post is the second in a series taking a closer look at the findings of the 2021 City Clean Energy Scorecard. An earlier post looked at cities’ progress on energy equity.
Few cities have adequately enabled the use of efficient, low-carbon modes of transportation, according to recent data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). That’s a problem when transportation now accounts for 29% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, more than any other sector. While electric vehicles will be a key tool for reducing those emissions, shifting to more-efficient modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, and walking, will be equally critical—and the new data show how far we have to go in providing access to affordable, clean, and efficient alternatives to driving.
The NREL data was published for the first time in ACEEE’s recent City Clean Energy Scorecard. It’s derived from the lab’s new Mobility Energy Productivity (MEP) metric, which assesses the overall ability of a city’s transportation system to connect people to services and activities in an energy-efficient, convenient, and cost-effective way. A city’s overall MEP score is based on population-weighted averages of scores computed for locations across a city, each based on a range of variables related to these goals.
The MEP score also displays the relative contributions of various individual transportation modes to overall mobility. Looking at what portion of each city’s overall MEP score came specifically from its MEP score for efficient modes (i.e., walking, biking, and public transit) allowed us to compare the state of efficient mobility consistently across cities. (We did so instead of comparing cities’ overall MEP scores, which scale to the population and geographic extent of a city, leading more populous and larger cities to generally have higher overall scores).
All cities have room to improve
Of the 100 cities assessed in the City Scorecard, NREL has MEP data for 99. Efficient-mode scores made up at most 36% of a city’s total MEP score (Reno, Nevada), and as little as 6% (Springfield, Massachusetts). The mean was 17%. The more efficient-mode scores contribute to a city’s overall MEP, the more efficient the transportation system.

Cities with large MEP contributions from non-driving modes correlated with those that scored well on transportation policies and outcomes in the City Scorecard. Of the 10 highest-scoring cities in the Scorecard’s transportation chapter, 7 earned at least 20% of their total MEP score through the contributions of efficient modes. Of these 10, Oakland and San Francisco tied for the highest MEP efficient-mode contribution at 28%, while Atlanta had the lowest at 9%. The mean efficient-mode contribution among the group was 19%. Even the best-performing cities have room for significant improvement when it comes to increasing the overall efficiency of public transit, walking, and biking, and supporting the use of these modes as travel options.
Cities have policies available to improve efficient mobility
To meet ambitious climate goals and create livable, equitable communities, cities will need to ensure that residents have access to a wide array of transportation options and that the built environment supports car-free travel. To make the transition to efficient, low-carbon transportation systems, decision makers can use several policy levers scored in the City Clean Energy Scorecard, which showcases leading examples:
Smart land use and housing policies
Reshaping land use policies can help ensure that cities don’t just favor driving. Zoning codes that place a priority on dense, mixed-use, and transit-oriented development make key services accessible to all, while policies that require or incentivize the construction of low-income housing near transit help keep the most transit-dependent communities connected.
In Baltimore, for example, a citywide code that encourages the development of mixed-use neighborhoods is exemplary of the type of policy that earns high scores in the transportation section of the Scorecard. In Washington, DC, the housing code mandates that all District land dispositions located near transit carry a 30% affordable housing requirement.
Of the 100 cities scored in the 2021 Scorecard, only 26 earned full credit for location-efficient zoning codes, and only 3 scored full marks for their policies advancing low-income housing around transit. Of the top-scoring cities this year, only Miami and Washington, DC, scored full points in both metrics. Interestingly, neither had particularly high MEP efficient-mode score contributions, so there appears to be a need to supplement what cities are already doing concerning location efficiency with new policy actions and ideas.
Mode shift targets
ACEEE awards points to cities in the Scorecard that set specific goals for shifting trips to efficient transportation modes. Establishing modal share goals can help a city identify weak spots within its transportation network and better plan for future transportation-related projects that will in turn help them meet their modal targets. Perhaps most importantly, goals help a city measure progress toward a target.
Minneapolis’s goal of converting 60% of all trips to non-car modes (at least 35% walking or biking and 25% by transit) by 2035, using a 2019 baseline, is an excellent example of a goal that is both comprehensive in scope and aggressive. Twenty cities earned full credit for their modal share targets in 2021, down from 21 cities in 2020. With only one-fifth of cities scoring full credit for this metric, this is an area of much needed improvement moving forward.
Investments in public transit
Although the majority of transit funding comes from federal and state sources, cities can supplement this funding through creative mechanisms. A city’s efforts to financially support its transit system exemplify a commitment to low-carbon transportation and equitable transportation outcomes. Public transit is the most efficient mode of mass transport in most cities, so properly funding such networks ensures that a broad community of people have reliable, safe, and relatively efficient transportation. New York City, Oakland, San Francisco, and Seattle were the only cities to earn full credit, and 42 of the 100 cities assessed failed to score any points for transit funding in the 2021 Scorecard. The top 4 scorers for transit funding also had an exceptionally high mean MEP efficient-mode ratio of 25%. 
Enabling more efficient mobility
Each of these policies can go a long way toward increasing the connectivity of American cities. While tools such as the MEP don’t prescribe specific changes, they can help highlight areas of need and help policymakers create transportation policies that respond to existing travel trends and gaps within cities’ existing transportation systems.

Countries’ Limited Energy-Saving Efforts Need Rapid Scaling to Meet Climate Crisis;"France ranks #1, Netherlands moves up to #3, and U.S. remains at #10
Washington, DC—Despite an intensifying climate crisis and global uncertainty in energy markets, the world’s largest energy-using countries are making only limited progress in reducing energy waste and planet-warming emissions, according to the 2022 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard, published today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). To meet their climate goals, the report says, countries will need to rapidly scale their efficiency efforts.
International Symposium on Energy Efficiency
No country came close to a perfect score, and the average—48.5 out of 100—dipped slightly since the last scorecard in 2018. Yet some countries are taking bold steps such as increasing sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and adopting building performance standards, which require inefficient buildings to make energy-saving upgrades. France is a fine example, taking the top spot for the first time with 74.5 points. It’s closely followed by the United Kingdom (72.5 points), Germany and the Netherlands (each with 71.5), and Italy (68.5).
This fifth edition of the International Scorecard comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has unsettled energy markets and increased prices and just a few months after many countries committed to deeper emissions cuts at a UN conference (COP 26) last year. It ranks 25 of the world’s largest energy users on 36 efficiency metrics and highlights best practices all countries can use to boost energy savings.
“Countries need energy efficiency now more than ever, especially as climate impacts worsen and gas prices soar,” said Steve Nadel, report coauthor and ACEEE’s executive director. “Efficiency can halve energy use and emissions while reducing dependence on foreign oil and pain at the pump,” he said, adding it’s often the least expensive way to meet the world’s growing demand for energy.
  The scorecard evaluates countries accounting for 82% of energy consumed on the planet. It scores them on policy measures, such as fuel economy standards for vehicles and energy codes for buildings, as well as performance metrics, such as average miles per gallon (mpg) for cars and energy use per unit of floor area in homes. It awards up to 25 points in each of four categories: buildings, industry, transportation, and national efforts. It finds clear leaders:
France scores first overall, ousting Germany from the top spot it held in the prior scorecard four years ago. It also scores first in the transportation sector. It has a bonus-malus system that finances bonus payments for EVs by levying fees on emission-intensive vehicles. France aims, by 2040, to end the sale of new cars and light commercial vehicles using fossil fuels. It spends slightly more to develop and maintain rail than it does on roads. In has enacted building performance standards for existing homes and has an ambitious building retrofit program. Like many European countries, it has comprehensive mandatory building codes and requires buildings to disclose their energy use.
The Netherlands, the most improved country, moves up four spots to tie for third place overall. It also takes the top spot for both buildings and national efforts. Beginning in 2018, it no longer allowed new houses to be connected to the gas grid, and beginning in 2026, existing homes will need to switch to all-electric or hybrid heat pumps as replacement fossil gas only systems will no longer be allowed. In January 2021, the Netherlands began requiring new construction to meet “almost energy neutral” criteria that are akin to zero-energy requirements in which buildings produce at least as much energy as they use. In 2018, it adopted building performance requirements for office buildings that go into effect in 2023. The Netherlands also leads the pack of 25 countries in the EV share of new vehicle sales: 25% in 2020 compared to just 2% in the United States.
Germany shares both the third spot overall and the top spot for national efforts with the Netherlands. To coordinate with the European Union’s current energy efficiency target to reduce energy consumption by a third by 2030, Germany has a broad energy efficiency strategy as part of its “Energiewende"" (or energy transition). It offers robust government funding such as tax incentives and loan programs for building retrofits, decarbonized heating and cooling systems, efficient industrial technologies, and EV purchases, which accounted for 13.5% of new car sales in 2020.
Japan ranks seventh overall and first in the industry category. It has regulatory measures, voluntary actions, and financial incentives to encourage greater energy efficiency as well as the low energy intensity of its industry. Since 1979, a law has required companies to appoint an energy manager, report their annual energy consumption, and achieve specific energy efficiency targets.
The United Kingdom places second overall as well as second in both transportation and industry. It plans to develop a net-zero carbon industrial cluster (or hub) by 2040. Backed by public investment, the UK plans for its industrial clusters to drive large-scale investment in energy efficiency and low-carbon products and technologies. In transportation, it has set high fuel economy standards for cars of 64.4 mpg by 2025; its average fuel economy for cars is already about 40 mpg.
“Top-scoring countries, though far from perfect, offer ideas for what other countries can do to increase their energy security, cut emissions, and save money,” said Sagarika Subramanian, the report’s lead author and ACEEE senior research analyst. “Notably, they’re rapidly scaling purchases of EVs by offering incentives and, in a key opportunity for the United States, France and the Netherlands are cutting energy waste by adopting building performance standards.”
The United States remained in 10th place but saw its overall score drop slightly to 54 points. It lost points because of the Trump administration’s rollback of light-duty fuel economy standards, along with low public transit ridership and relatively little investment in rail. It continues, though, to excel in the buildings sector. Many U.S. states have some of the world’s strongest building codes, including significant requirements for building envelopes, heating and cooling, and lighting. Although some need updating, it’s also the leader in energy-saving standards for appliances and equipment, with 52 standards on record.
Scoring just ahead of the United States, in ninth place, is China—by far the world’s largest user of energy. It has comprehensive policies to reduce energy use in buildings, including appliance standards, mandatory green labeling for some building types, and building energy codes. In transportation, it has a goal of 57.9 mpg for cars by 2025, a national smart freight initiative, and the highest share of trips taken by public transit.
Canada lost considerable ground, falling from the 10th place that it shared with the United States in 2018 to the 13th spot because of low scores in transportation and industry. Italy lost the most ground, falling from the prior top spot it shared with Germany to fifth place. Compared to the top scorers, it had relatively high energy intensity in buildings and less-comprehensive building rating and disclosure policies. Still, among scorecard countries, Italy has the highest operational efficiency of thermal power plants and the highest average fuel economy (45.2 mpg in 2017) for cars.
The scorecard ranks countries on 2020 EV sales and the most recent data available, some of it coming from 2018 or earlier. As a result, the data generally do not account for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2022 edition replaced Ukraine with Egypt because of a significant drop in Ukraine’s energy use since the last scorecard. This drop stemmed from its loss of authority over Crimea, the conflict in heavily industrial regions bordering Russia, and energy efficiency improvements triggered by the cutoff of gas supplies from Russia.
For its part, Russia ranked near the bottom of the countries scored, coming in at #22 with 28 points. The only countries scoring lower were South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, with 23.5 points and 21.5 points, respectively. Although Saudi Arabia rounded out the bottom three with 25 points, it still showed improvement, gaining more points (8.5) than any other country, partly because of its 2018 update of the Saudi Building Code. Data availability was an issue for these lower-ranked countries, which could not receive points where data were unavailable.

It’s Time to Electrify Industry’s Process Heat—with Heat Pumps;"As gas prices soar, a familiar but little-used technology—industrial heat pumps (IHP)—offers a compelling path to greater electrification and energy security, according to a report published today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. The research shows that, where applied, IHPs could cut U.S. industrial energy use associated with process heat (the heat that powers manufacturing) by up to one-third and eliminate the equivalent of nine million cars’ emissions.
IHPs, essentially residential heat pumps on steroids, have been around for decades. While increasingly used in Europe, Japan, and Australia, they have gained little traction in the United States, which has fallen woefully behind in the race to decarbonize industry.
Bringing large-scale electrification to the industrial sector is important because industry accounts for more than 25% of U.S. energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This includes the thermal energy used to prepare materials and produce manufactured goods (process heat), which accounts for 50% of on-site energy use. Today, less than 5% of process heat comes from electricity; instead, it’s sourced from fossil fuels. Beneficial electrification (the increased use of electricity from low- or no-carbon sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower) is a prime route for industry to reduce energy and GHGs, so it’s crucial to greatly accelerate adoption of electric technologies such as IHPs. 
Now is the time to press the accelerator on IHP adoption. Corporate sustainability goals and aggressive science-based targets for GHG reductions have many companies searching for solutions. IHPs are a solution that can be implemented in the near term, delivering a fast start to GHG reductions. IHPs are commercially available, and their capabilities have advanced, making them ready to meet a broad range of needs (several types can provide process heat up to 160oC, twice the previous limit). IHPs can be a great fit for supplying heat in industries such as food and beverage, pulp and paper, and chemicals, where there is a high proportion of process heat in the range of IHP applicability. Multiple IHP types can now provide heat up to 160°C, with 200oC a target for advanced types.

To accelerate IHP adoption, multiple stakeholders (e.g., industrial players, utilities, IHP vendors, service providers) need to recognize and pursue this opportunity. As the map below shows, the electricity-to-natural gas price ratio is disadvantaged in many regions of the United States, creating an inviting opportunity for policy incentives and rate design. The recent increase in energy prices and energy security concerns may make IHPs even more attractive. Even with IHP paybacks of 2–3 years (the acceptable threshold for industry), the uncertainty of investing in newer technology combined with uncertain integration, local service and maintenance capabilities can be obstacles. Policy enablers and incentives can address these challenges effectively while catalyzing electrification, improving the efficiency of process heat generation, and increasing flexibility and competitiveness. 
The level of impact achievable with IHPs is worth the investment. ACEEE’s research shows that across the applications studied in the three industries noted above, IHPs could:
Save the equivalent energy use/year of 2.7–3.1 million homes (26–32% of the source energy [net, after subtracting electricity use] depending on the scenario).
Avoid emissions equivalent to those of 6.5–9.4 million cars/year (30–43 million metric tons CO2e /year in 2022).
Use 5 gigawatt/year of additional electricity to run the IHPs, facilitating electrification. A gigawatt is the amount of electricity needed to run a medium sized city.
The energy and GHG savings could be even greater across additional applications and industries. And the GHG savings could double as the electric grid becomes greener.
To realize that potential, the United States needs to move quickly to overcome hurdles in multiple categories: economics, technical risk, integration, and development of local service capabilities. The keys to accelerated impact for IHPs include support for pilots, enabling policies, and development of infrastructure that will increase access to and reliable use of beneficial electrification for industry.

Utilities Show Promise in Using Innovative Financing for Efficiency Efforts;"Energy efficiency as a service, or EEaaS, is a promising approach to financing energy-saving upgrades, but it must expand rapidly to help retrofit buildings at the speed and scale that climate change demands. An ACEEE report, published today, shows how utilities could provide the needed spark by offering EEaaS to their customers and supporting its growth.
The as-a-service model is familiar to anyone who has ridden in an Uber or watched a movie over a streaming platform: customers pay for a service instead of owning the technology. In the case of EEaaS, a service provider might install efficient lighting or HVAC systems in a customer’s facilities; the provider owns the equipment for the duration of the contract. In exchange, the customer regularly pays the provider a fee, which can be fixed or based on savings. After the contract expires, the customer typically can choose to purchase the equipment at fair market value (accounting for depreciation), extend the contract, or, less commonly, return the equipment.
This system helps spur retrofits because the provider takes responsibility for the equipment’s upfront costs and subsequent performance risk, barriers that too often prevent businesses from making needed upgrades.
Although their involvement in EEaaS is still new and mostly in the pilot phase, utilities are logical candidates to help scale it in the marketplace. They are generally experts on providing energy services and efficiency programming to customers, and as states adopt stricter carbon reduction targets, EEaaS can help utilities meet their energy efficiency goals of saving energy and reducing carbon emissions.
Two Utilities Show Emerging Models
Duke Energy One, a subsidiary of one of the largest investor-owned utilities in the United States, spurs decarbonization and reduces energy waste without the use of ratepayer or other funds through its Direct Efficiency℠ product. Partnering with EEaaS provider Allumia, which provides the technology and helps with project management, Duke Energy One recently entered an EEaaS arrangement with a North Carolina-based convenience store distributor that sought to make energy efficiency upgrades to the lighting in its warehouse facility.
Duke Energy One funded, developed, implemented, and maintains the energy saving upgrades at the facility with no upfront capital required by the customer. The customer makes service payments to Duke Energy One, based on a percentage of energy savings, and is projected to save approximately $117,000 in energy and maintenance costs over the next 10 years.
Across the country, Seattle City Light’s EEaaS pilot program, launched in 2019, is based on the Metered Energy Efficiency Transaction Structure (MEETS™). The first building to complete an application for the program is a 500,000 square-foot office building Seattle built in the 1970s. The planned upgrades, which include LED lighting upgrades and a cooling loop heat-reclamation system, among others, are expected to reduce energy use by almost one-third (32%). Over the 20-year term of the agreement, Seattle City Light will pay the provider an amount starting at 11 cents per kWh of energy saved (with a 2% per year escalator).
An Opportunity for Utilities to Meet Business and Climate Goals
Through EEaaS, utilities can leverage brand recognition and provide value to their customers; this is especially important in deregulated markets as a strategy for utilities to stay engaged and reduce the chances that customers take their business to another energy provider.
EEaaS can open the door to greater energy savings than traditional energy efficiency programs offered by utilities. Not only does EEaaS overcome the common customer-side barriers of upfront cost and performance risk, its service providers and program sales teams will be motivated to seek customers likely to have the highest realized energy savings. 
Existing efficiency incentive programs will not be enough to achieve the broader greenhouse gas emissions and energy reduction goals sought by states, local governments, and utilities. At current rates it will take 60 years to complete whole-building retrofits on commercial buildings.
Given the urgency of the climate crisis, innovative, long-term strategies are needed to implement energy upgrades across the built environment. While obstacles remain, EEaaS offers an important opportunity for commercial and industrial buildings to reduce energy consumption and meet utilities’ business and climate goals.

EPA Truck and Bus Plan Must Be Boosted to Accelerate Cuts of Greenhouse Emissions;"Washington, DC—The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released the following statement from Avi Mersky, senior transportation researcher, in response to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) proposed updates today to standards for greenhouse gas and nitrogen oxide emissions from heavy-duty vehicles:
“Vehicle manufacturers, fleet owners, and states have made great strides toward transitioning to electric trucks and buses. The Biden administration has a key opportunity in this rulemaking to leverage that progress to maximize the climate impact of truck and bus standards.
“The plan today doesn’t take advantage of the dramatic advances in electric trucks, and EPA will need to strengthen it to accelerate the transition while maintaining progress on conventional vehicles. We can’t leave tools on the table.
“Under this proposal, petroleum-fueled trucks may stop improving, or even worsen, in fuel efficiency as more electric trucks are sold, potentially delaying the emissions reduction benefit of the technology. The proposal would continue to grant automakers a ‘multiplier’ on credits earned for selling electric vehicles that is greatly in excess of actual emission reductions, allowing fleetwide emissions to increase.
“In the final rule, EPA should eliminate the ‘multipliers’ that over-credit electric vehicles’ emissions reductions, and increase the stringency of the standards to take advantage of the substantial growth in electric vehicles’ market share.
""Concerning the proposed standard for nitrogen oxides, the strongest possible final standard for these pollutants will be critical to protecting public health, particularly in disadvantaged communities that disproportionately experience heavy-truck traffic.""
Background:
ACEEE has previously shown how EPA could boost the impact of truck and bus standards by updating them in this rulemaking to leverage the swift increase in electric vehicles.

Study: Mercury-Laced Fluorescent Bulbs Should Be Phased Out—LEDs Now More Economical;"Transition to More-Efficient Bulbs Would Cut Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Washington, DC—Fluorescent tube light bulbs, once embraced as an energy-efficient option, use far more energy than today’s LEDs and are now a needless toxic health risk, according to a study published today. Laws and rules restricting the use of toxic mercury have generally exempted these mercury-containing bulbs because of a lack of better options, but the study shows for the first time that LEDs are now available in all needed shapes and sizes—and cost less to own and operate.
Transitioning all new fluorescent bulbs to LEDs in the United States alone would cut annual carbon dioxide emissions in 2030 by an amount equal to the emissions from 4 million typical passenger cars over a year, the report finds. The new study is published jointly by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), CLASP, and the Clean Lighting Coalition.
State, federal, and international policymakers should now phase out the fluorescent bulbs to prevent more mercury from being introduced into households and the environment while cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the study argues. As soon as this month, international negotiators meeting to update a convention on mercury pollution can do so.
An example of one common type of fluorescent bulb
The bulbs at issue are the four- and eight-foot tubes common in commercial buildings and in some home kitchens, basements, and garages, as well as several types of compact fluorescent bulbs designed for use in certain fixtures. Their toxic mercury can be released in several ways. An estimated 75% of fluorescent bulbs used in the United States are not recycled or disposed of properly; mercury leached from landfills eventually reaches rivers, lakes, and oceans, where it bioaccumulates in fish and shellfish. Consumption of contaminated seafood is the leading cause of human exposure to mercury. Broken bulbs in homes and buildings, if not properly cleaned up, can also present a health risk to those nearby.
Rapidly phasing out most fluorescent models would prevent bulbs containing 16,000 pounds of mercury from being sold and installed in the United States through 2050, the study finds—a massive amount for a toxin that can damage the human brain with only a miniscule quantity.
“Fluorescent bulbs used to be the energy-efficient option, but that’s just not the case anymore. LEDs have changed the game and we found there’s no good reason to keep using fluorescents at this point,” said Jennifer Thorne Amann, senior fellow at ACEEE and report coauthor.
Joanna Mauer, technical advocacy manager for ASAP and fellow coauthor, said, “LEDs are now widely available as drop-in replacements for fluorescent bulbs. In addition to not containing mercury, LEDs last about two times longer than fluorescents and cut energy use in half. Any increase in initial price more than pays off through the reduced electricity costs.”
An international agreement among 137 countries, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, is phasing out the use of mercury in numerous products and industrial processes and uses. But the convention—drafted in 2013—specifically exempts lighting, citing a lack of cost-effective alternatives at that time. Later this month, the nations will consider a proposal that would ban the manufacture, import, and export of fluorescent bulbs in the participating countries.
“The United States can be a leader in the global transition to clean lighting,” said Ana Maria Carreño, director at CLASP, which funded the report. “By supporting the African Lighting Amendment at the Minamata Convention on Mercury, U.S. policymakers will be making a statement to the world that it is time to say farewell to fluorescents.”
The report also finds:
For businesses—where most linear fluorescent bulbs are used—additional upfront costs for the most common LED bulbs in the United States are paid back in less than two months. For households, the payback period for the most common LED bulbs is about a year.
A complete transition from fluorescent bulbs to LED lighting in the United States would cut 18 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually in 2030. On a cumulative basis, a phaseout would cut carbon dioxide emissions by more than 200 million metric tons through 2050.
The United States can support a global phaseout of fluorescents by 2025 through the Minamata Convention, and the federal government and U.S. states can phase out fluorescents in the United States through several mechanisms:
U.S. states: Twenty-three states have prohibited the sale of some products that contain mercury, but all include exemptions for most fluorescent bulbs. The California and Vermont legislatures are considering bills that would end the sale of common fluorescent bulbs.
U.S. federal government: Several federal laws and rules govern mercury pollution, limiting emissions from industrial sources and governing end-of-life product disposal. A phaseout of mercury-containing bulbs could be accomplished either through EPA regulation under existing law or through congressional modification of federal bulb efficiency standards. (Separately, two pending Biden administration proposals could phase out most incandescent and halogen bulbs, which are much less efficient than fluorescent bulbs).
###
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), a nonprofit research organization, develops policies to reduce energy waste and combat climate change. Its independent analysis advances investments, programs, and behaviors that use energy more effectively and help build an equitable clean energy future.
The Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) organizes and leads a broad-based coalition effort that works to advance, win, and defend new appliance, equipment, and lighting standards that cut emissions that contribute to climate change and other environmental and public health harms, save water, and reduce economic and environmental burdens for low- and moderate-income households.

These Nine Strategies Can Help Utilities Cut Energy Use and Emissions;"Across the United States, utilities are giving customers incentives to buy equipment that may do a great job of cutting energy use but fall short in cutting emissions. How can these incentives optimize both? Nine strategies can help shift utility energy efficiency programs so they no longer focus solely on reducing energy use but instead also reduce planet-warming emissions, according to a report released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
The report, A Roadmap for Climate-Forward Efficiency, is the second part of the Climate-Forward Efficiency Initiative. This initiative aims to assist legislators, utilities, and regulators in realigning utility energy efficiency programs to prioritize greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. It launched last year with another report that showed the need for these programs to focus on decarbonizing the economy and meeting climate goals. As we move forward, we invite stakeholders to join us in advancing this transformation.
To better understand what a climate-forward efficiency future may look like, and how we get there, let’s take an imaginary journey through a future in which stakeholders are using energy efficiency programs to address our climate crisis. Though idealized, these steps reflect actions that some states, utilities, and regulators are currently taking throughout the United States.
   1.               Center Equity 
At the heart of the journey is the need to ensure that climate-aligned energy efficiency programs benefit all customers. Low-income customers, residents of environmental justice communities, and other underserved groups are disproportionately hurt by climate change and high energy bills. States, utilities, and regulatory commissions begin by engaging these communities and their stakeholders in planning and decision-making. They collect equity-related data about building conditions, local pollution, demographics, and other factors.
They then set accountability standards, like the District of Columbia’s requirement that the DC Sustainable Energy Utility channel 35% of its program funding through certified community-based or women/minority-owned local businesses and organizations. Regulators can even tie utility compensation to meeting equity targets.
 2.               Set Climate Commitments
Our journey continues to the state legislature, where lawmakers set climate targets and policy mandates to limit average global temperature increase to 1.5°C, as about half of U.S. states have already done. Doing so opens the door for a wide range of decarbonization actions. One such activity is clarifying the responsibilities of the state’s regulatory commission, as Maryland did in May 2021 when it updated the charge of its Public Service Commission to consider climate change and fair labor standards during rulemaking. These initial steps can empower utilities to set energy efficiency program goals and investment plans that align with climate commitments.
 3.               Update Guidelines for Resource Eligibility and Valuation
With the high-level guidance in place, legislators continue to remove roadblocks. They redefine the efficiency measures ratepayers can support, as Minnesota did with its 2021 Energy Conservation and Optimization Act. This law removed prohibitions against “fuel switching,” allowing utilities to incentivize technologies that will save the most energy and avoid the most emissions, regardless of which fuel powers them.
 4.               Reform Utility Business Models
Utilities deserve to financially benefit from well-designed and -executed climate-forward efficiency programs. State legislators can help by setting or updating revenue decoupling, which provides utilities with revenue independent of the volume of energy they sell. Regulators continue the process by approving performance incentives that financially reward utilities for achieving desired climate-forward efficiency outcomes, and by reforming electric rates that reward customers for saving energy during high carbon emission periods. Regulators further encourage utilities to procure the most cost-effective, climate-aligned resources, regardless of ownership or technology.
 5.               Design Effective, Scalable Programs
Once legislators have set the table for climate-forward efficiency, utilities begin to design new efficiency programs that are easy for customers to access. Utilities understand that programs only work with customer buy-in, so they test and adjust their marketing messages to ensure customers are being engaged in ways that appeal to what they care about. Utilities also take steps to transform and strengthen the market for low-carbon technologies. They may choose to emulate Efficiency Vermont’s heat pump, space-heating, and water-heating program, which offers a $600 incentive to distributors in addition to discounts for income-qualified customers.
 6.               Administer Integrated Programs
A truly holistic decarbonization strategy will involve a combination of energy efficiency, demand flexibility, electrification, renewable energy, and storage. Utilities simplify these solutions by bundling measures together for customers. They may choose to follow the model of NYSERDA’s Comfort Home Program by offering staged upgrades that encourage homeowners to invest in envelope and duct improvements before replacing fossil-fueled heating systems with high-efficiency cold climate heat pumps.
 7.               Unlock Necessary Data
Regulators approve and encourage the use of energy consumption data to help utilities focus their efficiency efforts. Those data include forecasts of future grid GHG emissions and more-detailed energy efficiency savings estimates. By lowering the barriers to obtaining these data, legislators and regulators make it easier for others to develop innovative solutions. For example, Recurve, a clean energy solutions software company, has used California’s energy data access to develop its FLEXvalue engine for computing grid and carbon benefits of demand-side measures.
 8.               Prepare the Workforce
Utilities collaborate with state agencies on regional workforce studies to assess workforce trends and communicate the number of skilled workers required to meet local goals. Programs such as New York State’s Workforce Development Initiative and Massachusetts’s Workforce Skills Cabinet show how to leverage statewide funds for regionally customized workforce development projects. Utilities support pre-apprenticeship programs to diversify the pool of workers, and provide adequate accommodations and compensation to help those workers find rewarding careers. Regulators may choose to follow the California Public Utility Commission model of requiring utilities to report on how ratepayer dollars are addressing job quality, access, and workforce development.
 9.               Secure Funding
To avoid burdening ratepayers with the full cost of climate-forward efficiency policy goals, utilities leverage federal funding, such as the U.S. Department of Energy’s State Energy Program to support energy audits and building retrofits. They also take advantage of regional, state, and local funding, such as using Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative proceeds to weatherize low-income households. In addition, utilities piggyback climate-forward efficiency goals onto existing programs. For example, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power partners with other City of Los Angeles departments to conduct building energy audits by piggybacking on a city program that inspects premises for habitability.
Moving forward with these strategies
While this particular journey was imaginary, the above examples and the map below show that statehouses, utilities, and public utility commissions have already adopted pieces of this vision. These leaders demonstrate that it is entirely possible to use utility energy efficiency programs to meet deep decarbonization goals. If we care about protecting customers, our economy, and our environment, it is time to make this journey a reality for the rest of the country.

Here’s How Congress Can Help Industry Become Cleaner and More Competitive;"Congress has a pivotal opportunity with pending legislation to help industry become cleaner, more competitive, and better able to meet U.S. climate goals. The United States needs to invest in clean industrial technologies to remain globally competitive, because many of its foreign rivals are already making these investments.
In the coming weeks, Congress will decide the provisions of a bill that could not only boost U.S. competitiveness but also help decarbonize the industrial sector, which now accounts for more than a fourth of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The House passed a bill earlier this month, the America COMPETES Act, that includes three key manufacturing provisions. A related Senate bill on competitiveness, approved last year, does not contain these provisions, but lawmakers negotiating the final legislation should include them to improve competitiveness and spur decarbonization.
These three provisions would do the following:
First Three Transformative Industrial Technologies: Some of the greatest available carbon savings per federal dollar are in measures to help commercialize innovative industrial processes. A provision offered by Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL) would authorize $9.5 billion to support the first three commercial-scale implementations of transformative industrial technologies. One example could be a cement plant that reuses large portions of its carbon dioxide emissions as a feedstock.
The provision would allow the United States to accelerate the commercialization of low-carbon technologies for manufactured goods—something that Canada, Japan, the European Union, and China have already begun to do. In Canada, for example, Apple, Alcoa, Rio Tinto, the Canadian government, and others are building a factory using a low-carbon process for making aluminum.  
These installations of new technologies will both foster partnerships between manufacturers and government and create jobs.
Flex-Tech: This provision, offered by Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY), would spread nationwide a very successful program in New York State that improves the energy efficiency, carbon intensity, and sustainability of manufacturing facilities. The program helps manufacturers assess and implement site-specific energy and sustainability investments that reduce energy costs, increase productivity, and reduce carbon emissions.
For example, the New York Flex-Tech program helped the 150-year-old Steinway piano plant in Long Island City increase productivity, reduce waste, and lower energy costs $30,000 annually by implementing a host of energy efficiency measures and installing a solar thermal project. 
Commercial Deployment of Efficient Technologies for Industry: This provision by Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA) supports the deployment of clean industrial technologies. It builds on the Energy Act of 2020's funding for their research, development, and demonstration by adding the further step of commercial deployment. It would authorize $5 billion, and also may be eligible for $500 million already appropriated under the bipartisan infrastructure bill enacted earlier this year.   
To ensure the competitiveness of U.S. industry in a world transitioning to new decarbonized technologies, Congress should include these three provisions in its final competitiveness bill. The provisions will spur U.S. innovation and transformation that will strengthen U.S. manufacturing and yield low-carbon products for consumers all across the world.

Plug-In and Gas Hybrids Top GreenerCars’ 2022 Ratings as Automakers Shift to Larger EVs;"Washington, DC—All-electric vehicles (EVs) now account for fewer of the dozen greenest cars available, partly because of a shift toward larger and heavier EVs that are less environmentally friendly, according to this year’s GreenerCars ratings, released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). 
These EVs take only four of the top spots on the ratings’ “Greenest List” for 2022 vehicles—down from seven last year. Three of the previous top EVs—Hyundai Ioniq electric, BMW i3s, and Kia Soul electric—are no longer sold in the United States. Some have been replaced by larger versions with heavier batteries, such as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and BMW i4, that cause more greenhouse gas emissions.
As a result, energy-efficient gasoline hybrids account for five of the greenest cars—up from only two last year. They include Honda's Insight, two by Hyundai (Elantra Blue and Sonata Blue), and two by Toyota (Camry LE and Corolla). The other seven greenest cars are plug-in hybrid vehicles, including the #1 scoring Toyota Prius Prime, which reclaims the spot it held in 2020, and #2 Hyundai Ioniq, or all-electric cars such as the Mini Cooper SE Hardtop 2-door (#3) and the Nissan Leaf (#4).  
""Automakers are pledging more all-electric models, but they're discontinuing some of the most efficient ones, leaving consumers with fewer compact, ultra-green choices,"" says Peter Huether, ACEEE’s senior transportation research analyst. ""Automakers shouldn't produce only huge EVs. Such EVs, though more energy efficient than similarly sized gasoline counterparts, mean higher consumer costs and planet-warming emissions than small electric cars.""
The 25th annual GreenerCars ratings come amid continuing tumult in the automotive industry. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the industry’s supply chain, leading to widespread vehicle and parts shortages. At the same time, the Biden administration announced a goal for 50% new EV sales by 2030 as well as new emissions and fuel-efficiency standards. Both announcements have the potential to greatly increase efficient and electric offerings over the next decade.  
Greenest List  
This year’s Greenest List features the most environmentally friendly cars for model year 2022. Each car receives a Green Score based on an environmental damage index, which reflects the cost to human health from air pollution associated with vehicle manufacturing and disposal, the production and distribution of fuel or electricity, and vehicle tailpipes. ACEEE evaluated more than 1,000 models, including vehicles fueled entirely by gasoline or diesel (including hybrids), plug-in hybrids powered by energy both from gasoline and electricity from plugging into the grid, and all-electric vehicles. 
While the rise in the number of hybrids on this year’s Greenest List occurred in part because of the shift to heavier EVs, it also resulted from updates to the scoring methodology. Based on periodically updated estimates from the federal government, GreenerCars considers the emissions from producing a vehicle’s materials. For model year 2022, the federal estimate showed an increase in the emissions associated with mining lithium, a crucial mineral used in EV batteries.  
  No pure internal combustion engine vehicles made the Greenest List. Yet the list does include five gasoline hybrids, which combine a small gasoline engine with an efficient electric motor (and capture the energy from braking in the battery) to improve the vehicle’s overall efficiency. This is a good indication that even a small degree of electrification can greatly improve fuel economy.
Greener Choices 
GreenerCars.org identifies practical options in each vehicle class for widely available automatic transmission gasoline-powered models. The Greener Choices List includes conventional vehicles and traditional hybrids that are available in all 50 U.S. states but excludes plug-in hybrids and all-electric or pure battery EVs given the limited availability of charging stations. 
  This year’s list has many familiar faces, with hybrids taking seven of the dozen spots again. One vehicle, the Toyota Corolla Hybrid, also makes our Greenest List, while another three are different versions of models among our greenest scorers.  
Meanest List 
GreenerCars.org also provides a Meanest List, as usual made up this year of gasoline-fueled large SUVs, pickup trucks, and European luxury cars that are the least friendly to the environment. The RAM 1500 TRX 4x4 takes the first (“meanest”) position again this year, with the rest of the list mostly populated by regulars from prior years. 
Note: The GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado are nearly identical and therefore only one is included on the Meanest List. 
Green Scores of the model year 2022 vehicles are available in the GreenerCars.org interactive database, along with each configuration’s fuel economy, health-related pollution impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions. Visitors can also turn to GreenerCars scores to determine eligibility for parking benefits at participating LEED-certified buildings.  
In addition to ACEEE’s 2022 Market Trends analysis, also released today, GreenerCars.org features shopping advice and a consumer primer on vehicles and the environment.

Analysis: Low-Income Residents Would Save If DOE Strengthened Manufactured Housing Plan;"Washington, DC—Low-income residents of manufactured homes would have significantly reduced housing costs if the Biden administration strengthened proposed energy efficiency standards for the homes, according to a report today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). The pending plan from the Department of Energy (DOE)—which does little to increase nearly 30-year-old insulation requirements for many manufactured homes—failed to consider how stronger standards would benefit many lower-income residents and overestimated the costs of energy-efficient construction, according to the report.
These homes (sometimes called mobile homes) are a critical type of affordable housing—more than half of residents have incomes under two times the federal poverty level—but they often use large amounts of energy because of limited insulation and outdated windows and heating equipment. Energy costs are nearly twice as high per square foot in these homes compared to site-built homes, and a quarter of their residents spend more than 10% of their income on energy costs, ACEEE has found.
DOE proposed long-overdue efficiency standards for the homes in August 2021, but its “primary” option would leave models with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price under $63,000 with requirements that are little stronger than the 1994 rules in place today, while residents of more expensive homes would benefit from significantly stronger standards. An “alternative” option would require the stronger standards for all manufactured homes but still not require technology like efficient, electrified water heating.
ACEEE’s report shows that DOE’s analysis accompanying its proposal only fully considers the benefits for the original owners, not all residents. Using revised assumptions—primarily based on government data—ACEEE finds that DOE’s stronger “alternative” option would generate $900 more in total net savings for the average single-wide home than the primary proposal would. And it finds that an even stronger standard, requiring one of several options such as an efficient heat pump water heater (which DOE has not considered), could increase the life-cycle savings by approximately $2,000 beyond those of DOE’s alternative (to $5,544).
“If DOE goes with its primary proposal, many of the lowest-income residents of manufactured homes will pay the price with high energy bills for decades to come. There’s nothing equitable about leaving the lowest-income residents with less insulated homes and exorbitant energy costs. The department suggested the weaker plan would help with affordability, but we found the opposite,” says Aimee Bell-Pasht, senior research associate for federal policy at ACEEE and lead author of the report. “Even DOE acknowledges that the stronger alternative would save residents more money in the long run, but when we updated the department’s assumptions, we found it ought to be setting a stronger standard still.”
Figure: Net housing cost savings for a single-section home at different standard levels compared to a HUD Code home by HUD climate zone over 30 years. Climate Zone 1 is in the South, Zone 2 in the middle, and Zone 3 in the North. The estimates are based on DOE’s analysis but have updated financing and cost assumptions.
To measure the impacts on housing affordability—a concern DOE cited in justifying its primary proposal—ACEEE calculated the number of manufactured home residents who would still face high energy burdens (energy bills exceeding 6% of income) or high housing burdens (total housing costs exceeding 30% of income) under each standard. The report finds that the alternative proposal—strengthened with an efficient heat pump water heater requirement—would decrease housing burdens, slightly lowering the share of residents with high housing burdens from 31.8% to 30.9%. The stronger standard would also relieve nearly 1,000,000 households from high energy burdens, roughly 440,000 more than under DOE’s primary proposal.
The ACEEE report faults DOE’s assumptions in several areas:
·        Missing impact calculations for low-income residents. DOE’s life-cycle cost analyses focus solely on owners (ignoring the one-quarter of residents who rent) and, in its 10-year analyses, focus only on a home’s first owner. This is a small subset of residents and typically not the lowest-income ones; ACEEE found that only 3% of low-income manufactured home residents own homes less than 10 years old. DOE’s approach fails to account for the benefits that stronger standards would create for all residents, including renters and second and third owners.
·        Faulty assumptions on home loans. DOE assumes that all cheaper manufactured homes are purchased using chattel loans, a form of personal property loans that typically have higher interest rates than mortgages. This assumption raises the department’s projected cost of more efficient homes. Yet 2019 Census Department data show that 56% of manufactured home residents own their homes but do not have a loan; only 19% do (the remainder are renters). And according to a 2021 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau study, only about half of residents who have a loan have a chattel loan, and the median income of owners with mortgages and chattel loans is almost the same, despite DOE’s assumption that chattel loans are used primarily by lower-income residents.
·        Questionable costs on efficient windows. When assessing the price of efficiency measures, DOE largely relied on prices that the manufactured home industry voluntarily reported in 2015, adjusted for inflation. Using these figures, the department assumed that more-efficient windows would cost multiple times what other government analyses have found, tilting the math against requiring them.
In each case, by using more-reliable assumptions, the report finds that the alternative standard or a stronger one would reduce overall costs even more than DOE has found and would better improve housing affordability for low-income residents than the primary option.
Background:
State or municipal building energy codes cover most new home construction, but the federal government regulates manufactured homes, which are made in facilities that may ship to multiple states. The Department of Housing and Urban Development sets a building code for the homes, but it has not updated the energy provisions since 1994.
Recognizing the need to reduce energy waste in these homes, Congress—in a bipartisan energy bill in 2007—directed DOE to develop and finalize a separate energy standard for manufactured homes by 2011. The Sierra Club sued DOE over its failure to publish a rule by the legal deadline; the department agreed in a settlement to publish a final rule by May 15, 2022.
In November 2021, attorneys general of 11 states and the City of New York supported the alternative proposal in comments to DOE and warned the department that finalizing a standard along the lines of its primary proposal would be in “violation” of the 2007 law.

Programs to Electrify Buildings Are Heating Up, Nationwide Report Shows;"Cold winters are common in Minnesota, where temperatures stay well below freezing for many months of the year. That’s one reason it’s surprising that Minnesota has recently become one of the latest states to pass a law encouraging residents to install efficient electric heat pumps, a technology that until recently was believed to be incompatible with cold climates. Now organizations such as the Minnesota Air Source Heat Pump Collaborative are working to expand the use of this technology to replace fossil fuels in buildings—and they’re not the only ones.
Municipal utilities such as the Burlington Electric Department in Burlington, Vermont, are thinking critically about electrification and converting fossil fuels used in buildings to efficient electric alternatives. With ambitious climate goals of reducing building-, water-, and transportation-related emissions 50% by 2030, Burlington is taking steps to encourage its residents to switch to heat pumps, smart water heaters, and even electric lawnmowers.
Across the United States, as a new ACEEE report shows, cities, states, utilities, and nonprofits are increasing efforts to electrify the buildings sector, where the burning of fossil fuels for space heating, water heating, cooking, and other uses accounts for 13% of total U.S. greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. By replacing fossil fuels with electric equivalents, and “greening the grid” by switching electricity generation to carbon-free energy sources, these efforts are becoming a powerful strategy in the fight against climate change.
Our report analyzes 42 such programs in the residential, multifamily, and commercial sectors and identifies trends, common approaches, and best practices. Though these programs are mainly found in states with ambitious climate targets, such as California and New York, there are examples of electrification efforts in many states across multiple climates, regions, and political environments, as shown in the map below.
Targets and Methods Vary
As any homeowner can attest, building improvements are hardly a simple or inexpensive process, and electrification is no exception. Our report finds that most electrification efforts focus primarily on space heating and hot water, which together represent the two largest direct uses of fossil fuels and corresponding sources of GHG emissions in buildings in the United States.
Other measures are less common in the programs we surveyed. Replacing gas-fired stoves with electric induction ranges, for example, features in about a third of programs. Finally, more than half of the programs combine electrification with conventional energy efficiency and weatherization measures, a tried-and-true approach that can make electric heat even more cost-effective and achieve higher carbon reductions from reduced energy waste.
Program implementers use incentives more than any other method to encourage customers to adopt these technologies. The incentives help reduce the up-front cost of the equipment, which can sometimes be more expensive than a fossil-fueled furnace or boiler even if it is cheaper to operate in the long run.
However, some programs use a different strategy. The Association for Energy Affordability in California is a nonprofit organization that since 2014 has worked with property managers and communities to upgrade low-income apartment complexes with energy efficiency, electrification, solar power, and other improvements that substantially reduce residents’ energy bills and GHG emissions.
This program, the Low Income Weatherization Program for Multifamily Properties, is funded through California’s cap-and-trade markets, meaning that the fees paid by some of the biggest contributors to climate change directly support GHG reductions and quality-of-life improvements for the state’s marginalized communities and residents.
Barriers Remain
One of the first barriers for customers looking to adopt electric space- and water-heating equipment is cost. High-efficiency heat pumps for space and water heating are often more expensive than conventional gas furnaces and boilers and may be more costly to operate in regions where the price of electricity is high relative to the price of natural gas.
Many of the programs in this study attempt to lower this up-front cost by offering rebates to customers. Most also recommend customers weatherize and insulate their homes, which further reduces operating costs. The economics of electrification are generally more favorable when displacing unregulated fuels like oil or propane. When building a new home, going all-electric is swiftly becoming the cheapest option for both homebuilders and future residents.
While the up-front cost of electrification is an important barrier to overcome, it is far from the only consideration that program administrators must make in order to scale up electrification in buildings. Across the nation, too few contractors, electricians, and plumbers are trained and motivated to install heat pumps and water heaters in customer homes. In New York, for example, homeowners who are interested in electrification are having trouble finding a contractor who is able and willing to do the work it takes to switch from fossil fuels to all-electric heat. That is why some organizations, such as the Minnesota ASHP Collaborative and NYSERDA offer job-training programs, peer networks, and incentives for contractors to gain familiarity with and certification in installing all-electric home technologies.
In addition, for electrification technologies like heat pumps to take off and grow quickly across the nation, customers need to be interested and willing to adopt them in their homes. In a survey of residential HVAC customers, 87% of respondents did not know or were unclear about the difference between mini-split heat pumps and traditional HVAC systems. Also, when a furnace or an air conditioner breaks, many customers will choose only to replace the broken part rather than the entire system.
These decisions—often made on an emergency basis—can unintentionally lock in fossil fuels and their associated carbon emissions for sometimes 15 years or more. Education and consumer outreach are vital steps for program implementers who are interested in growing demand for building electrification.
Although the market for building electrification is developing rapidly, we still have a long way to go in order to retrofit the tens of millions of homes that currently rely on outdated, polluting, and often costly fossil fuels. Electrification offers multiple benefits: Electric heat pumps provide air-conditioning as well as heating; electric water heaters that are grid-interactive allow homeowners to save money and reduce peak electricity demand on the grid; and induction cooking, more efficient and safer than gas or electric resistance stoves, allows precise control and rapid cooling of surfaces to avoid accidental burns and hazardous gas leaks.
These benefits show us that electrification is a climate strategy that doesn’t require compromises in quality of life. But getting to full building electrification requires everybody to play a part: from policymakers to utilities, to manufacturers, distributors, contractors, and homeowners. The lessons learned from past efforts can help us construct a pathway to a cleaner future, but our work must begin today.

Scorecard Update: Electrification Revs Up as States Advance Climate Action;"To aid recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and meet climate goals, states accelerated clean energy efforts last year, partly with ambitious new laws to decarbonize their economies with an increasing emphasis on electrification, according to a report today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
The State Energy Efficiency Scorecard: 2021 Progress Report shows that several states passed laws in 2021 that incentivize fuel switching, which includes switching from fossil-fueled heating to efficient electric heat pumps. Such state laws—in Illinois, Colorado, Massachusetts, and Minnesota—encourage electrification that can curb energy use and emissions.
“As states emerged from the early months of the pandemic, they turned to electrification and energy-saving standards to help address the growing urgency of the climate crisis,” says Weston Berg, senior researcher at ACEEE and lead author of the report, which is an interim update to ACEEE’s annual State Scorecard. He says the crisis was underscored by extreme weather disasters last year—a February storm in Texas and an unprecedented Pacific Northwest heat wave in June—that caused large-scale power outages and casualties. 
“States such as Massachusetts are adopting promising new laws that can reduce harmful pollution and create thousands of clean energy jobs, but they need to vigilantly implement them,” says Berg. He notes unfortunate recent decisions in Arizona and New Hampshire have put energy-saving efforts at risk. The good news: a 2021 federal infrastructure bill will offer states robust funding for efficiency and other clean energy measures.
Electrification efforts increased not only in the buildings sector but also in transportation, which accounts for the largest share (about 29%) of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. California and New York moved to require that all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold be zero-emission by 2035. Many states coordinated efforts to improve electric vehicle (EV) charging options by joining collaboratives, including the Regional Electric Vehicle West (REV West) and the Southeast Regional Electric Vehicle Information Exchange. In September, the governors of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin agreed to create a REV Midwest.
States pushed to promote electric trucks as well. Last year, Oregon, Washington, New York, and New Jersey followed California by adopting the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, which sets targets to increase sales of zero-emission trucks, and other states took steps to adopt the rule in the future. These actions build on commitments by 15 states and the District of Columbia in a 2020 memorandum of understanding to achieve 100% ZEV sales by 2050, with an interim target of 30% by 2030. Also critical for slashing transportation emissions are pairing electrification with smart growth land use to reduce vehicle miles traveled and promoting energy-efficient public transit.
As with electrification, new state laws sought to advance energy equity and affordability, which became more pressing issues as the virus-driven downturn exacerbated racial and economic inequalities.  
These laws include Minnesota’s Energy Conservation and Optimization Act, which increases funding for low-income energy efficiency programs, and Illinois’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which creates a health and safety fund for needed repairs to buildings occupied by low-income households. In addition: Massachusetts includes provisions to expand outreach to environmental justice populations; Nevada doubles energy efficiency funding for low-income customers and public schools in underserved communities; Oregon enables utilities to consider equity-related factors in determining customer energy rates; and Washington carves out funding for programs to help overburdened populations, including EV opportunities for low-income residents.
Efficiency Standards for Appliances, Cars, and Buildings
As the above map shows, some states included new or more stringent energy-saving standards for appliances and equipment in their clean energy laws. Other states adopted these standards as stand-alone measures. States also pushed to reduce energy waste with stricter efficiency standards for vehicles and buildings.
Appliance standards: States were particularly active in setting efficiency standards for products. New state laws in DC, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Rhode Island will require minimum energy and water use efficiency levels for more than 15 types of products, including air purifiers, computers, and restaurant equipment. In January, New Jersey signed into law new standards for 17 types of products. Massachusetts passed the first standards for EV chargers, and Nevada became the first state to adopt standards for gas fireplaces and air purifiers.
Fuel economy: While the federal government dragged its feet, states took action to improve the fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks. Virginia, Washington, Nevada, New Mexico, and Minnesota moved to adopt California’s clean car rules, including its low-emission vehicle regulations and zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) program. Virginia passed HB 1965, making it the 15th state to adopt California’s ZEV program.
Building codes: States advanced more-efficient building energy codes, many coinciding with long-term goals to establish “net-zero-energy"" codes and strengthen incentives for all-electric construction. Many states across the South, though, have sought to stymie these efforts by adopting prohibitions on gas bans and electrification codes. 

States adopting or implementing the 2018 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) in 2021 included Hawaii and Virginia. The new 2021 IECC, which the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has determined provides a 9.4% improvement in energy savings relative to the previous code, is also under review in many states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, as well as the District of Columbia.  

In addition, Illinois and Massachusetts passed legislation calling for new high-performance stretch codes, which require stricter efficiency than base codes, and Colorado became the second state, after Washington, to adopt a building energy performance standard for large buildings. Such a standard, a critical step for addressing energy waste in existing construction, requires buildings to meet performance targets by improving over time.
Pandemic’s Impact and Federal Funding
The COVID-19 pandemic had lingering disruptions to the energy efficiency industry, especially during the first half of 2020, that slowed overall progress. As a result, the amount of power saved by ratepayer-funded electric efficiency programs dipped 1.1% nationwide in 2020, from 26.9 million megawatt-hours (MWh) in 2019 to 26.6 million MWh. Of course, the impact varied across states, which took different approaches to addressing the pandemic.
Despite COVID’s overall impact, states can now tap new and unprecedented federal funding to advance their efforts. Last year, after months of negotiations, Congress reached an agreement on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed by President Biden in mid-November. The bill includes $3.5 billion for weatherizing homes of low-income households; more than $1 billion for building energy codes, new revolving loan funds supporting commercial building and home upgrades, public school and federal building upgrades, and worker training; $7.5 billion for installation of EV chargers; and millions more for industrial energy efficiency.
These investments—together with other federal funds via the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, Weatherization Assistance Program, and State Energy Program—offer states a historic opportunity to support a strong and equitable economic recovery and clean energy transition.
ACEEE will track how states take advantage of federal opportunities and move forward in multiple areas in its next edition later this year of the annual State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, which has analyzed states for more than 15 years.

Energy Efficiency Stands at Crossroads in Arizona, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire;"Utility regulators and lawmakers in Arizona, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire are set to make decisions in the coming weeks that will have major implications for these states’ climate efforts. The outcomes will determine the course of energy efficiency programs that serve millions of customers and could create thousands of clean energy jobs. 
Amid the backdrop of an ongoing economic recovery, these energy-saving programs provide a critical pathway to achieving ambitious climate goals by immediately cutting greenhouse gas emissions, creating jobs, and delivering other utility system, health, and equity benefits that are vital to building an inclusive clean energy future.
The upcoming decisions come as ACEEE is preparing to revamp and reimagine our State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, which annually ranks states on energy-saving progress. Many of the 2022 report’s new scoring metrics—including an expanded focus on advancing energy equity and electrification—will directly correspond to programs and policies under consideration in these states, and in turn could shape their respective performances in future State Scorecards.
Below we highlight exciting state policy developments we’re keeping an eye on and the energy-saving opportunities they could create.
Massachusetts
The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) stands poised this month to mark a historic evolution in its energy efficiency programs with a pending decision on whether to approve the newest three-year Mass Save plan. The 2022–24 plan includes a strengthened emphasis on electrification, equity, and workforce development and could serve as an important model for other states seeking ways to optimize the carbon benefits of energy-saving programs to support new climate targets.
The plan won unanimous approval from the state’s Energy Efficiency Advisory Council in October 2021 after stakeholders spent months developing programs to help the state meet the ambitious goals of climate legislation signed by Governor Baker in March that aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The plan also reflects critical updates the legislature has made in recent years to expand the scope and priorities of the state DPU, with an increased focus on equity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to ensure efficiency programs support the state’s efforts to decarbonize by midcentury.
This realignment of efficiency with decarbonization was also formalized last July. At that time, the state’s Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary that are designed to achieve a reduction of half a million metric tons of CO2 emissions from the electric sector and 341,000 metric tons of CO2 from natural gas programs. The goals include a focus on measures that will continue to yield cumulative savings over the next decade.
While Massachusetts has historically led the rankings of the State Scorecard on the strength of its strong commitment to energy efficiency, its fall to second place behind California in 2020 demonstrated the fierce competition it faces from other states that are doubling down on commitments to clean electricity and decarbonization. The 2022–24 Mass Save plan calls for programs—including enhanced efforts to bundle weatherization and efficient electrification, support all-electric construction, and help environmental justice communities and rental properties—that could position Massachusetts well to potentially reclaim its Scorecard throne later this year.
New Hampshire
Stakes are also high for the Granite State. An existential battle over the future of its energy efficiency programs is unfolding between the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (PUC)—which issued a decision late last year to gut program funding—and lawmakers who are working against the clock to pass legislation that would restore program support for this year and beyond. At risk are hundreds of jobs across the state and millions of dollars in energy bill savings for New Hampshire ratepayers.
The PUC decision in November 2021 effectively destroyed the state’s energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), a proven best-practice policy that has been instrumental in delivering energy savings and growing the efficiency industry in New Hampshire as well as 26 other states. But hope is still alive for programs under House Bill 549, which unanimously passed the state House of Representatives in early January. The bill would restore efficiency funding to 2020 levels, when the state reported net electric savings just above 1% (ranking 15th that year among states), though far short of levels proposed by utilities in their rejected 2022–24 plan.  
And last week the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee took House Bill 549 an important step further by unanimously voting for an amendment that would effectively reinstate the EERS. The measure requires the PUC to deliver triennial energy efficiency plans in perpetuity and provide for shareholder performance incentives that reward utilities’ efficiency progress. The bill also would restore the Granite State Test, a carefully designed cost-effectiveness screening tool the state approved in 2019 and which provides the cornerstone of the state’s efficiency efforts by ensuring programs save customers money.
New Hampshire utilities and policymakers have made laudable progress on energy efficiency under the state's EERS in recent years, yielding steadily growing levels of savings, and helping the state break into the top 20 of the State Scorecard with an 18th place finish in 2020. However, the recent PUC decision to retreat from its commitment to comprehensive cost-effective energy savings risks squandering that momentum and walking away from a carefully designed plan that would have written an exciting new chapter in energy efficiency for the state. We eagerly await potential next steps by the state legislature that could pull these programs back from the brink.
Arizona
Arizona’s energy efficiency future also stands at an important crossroads this week, with the Arizona Corporation Commission scheduled on January 26 to consider Energy Rules that have continued to persevere despite multiple delays and hurdles. The culmination of years of hard work and collaboration among utilities, commission staff, and advocates, the rules would finalize plans to decarbonize the Arizona grid by adopting a clean electricity standard, and would add Arizona to the list of 20 other states that have also approved similar 100% clean energy goals.
The rules extend and expand another important standard for electric utilities: the state’s EERS. Originally passed in 2010, Arizona’s EERS has been a key driver in developing strong utility efficiency programs to save customers money and strengthen local economies. These programs have saved ratepayers more than $1.4 billion over the past decade while supporting more than 40,000 jobs in recent years. For additional details about the rules and their rollercoaster regulatory journey, see our previous blog post.
These upcoming decisions mark a crossroads for these states. They will determine whether the three states choose to embrace the economic, health, and climate benefits of reducing energy waste, or risk surrendering the proven progress of these programs that have delivered billions in savings over the last decade. In each of these states, much of the hard work has already been done by stakeholders to carefully develop these common-sense plans and policies that would write an exciting next chapter in their clean energy futures. It’s now up to state legislatures and regulators to decide whether to turn the page.

Biden Must Boost Climate Impact of Truck and Bus Standards by Leveraging EV Momentum;"To maximize cuts in harmful emissions, the Biden administration needs to leverage the swift increase in electric vehicles (EVs) as it prepares this month to revise rules limiting the greenhouse gases and other pollutants that trucks and buses can emit. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will soon propose changes to heavy-duty vehicle standards, presenting a major opportunity to reduce emissions from these vehicles. The climate effort is expected to be part of a crucial larger rule that also will reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx), a dangerous local pollutant; the combined proposal is now pending in White House review.
The EPA needs to make substantial changes to the existing greenhouse gas (GHG) rules to take advantage of emerging technologies and avert unintended adverse outcomes.
Here’s why: The greenhouse gas standards at issue were set by EPA in 2016 and regulate a range of larger trucks and buses, or heavy-duty vehicles. These rules, known as Phase 2 emissions standards, did not anticipate—and hence do not capitalize on—the strong advances in electric trucks and buses now underway.
The average fuel efficiency and GHG emissions levels they require could be achieved with no EVs at all. As a result, they would allow petroleum-fueled trucks to stop improving, or even worsen, in fuel efficiency as more electric trucks are sold (which is now expected), squandering the emissions reduction benefit of this new technology. The EPA must update the standards at the first opportunity—model year 2027—to avert this outcome and help drive growth in EV sales.
States are boosting the electric truck market; EPA needs to pitch in by adjusting its standards
Several states have already adopted Advanced Clean Truck (ACT) regulations requiring annual ramp-ups in EV sales for major categories of heavy-duty vehicles, reaching 15%–20% by model year 2027. Several more have begun the process to adopt the rules or announced their intention to do so. Jointly, these states represent more than a third of the heavy-duty vehicle market, and their action will likely lead to increased EV sales beyond their borders as they help achieve economies of scale and increase the availability and variety of EV models in the broader market.
EPA must strengthen the GHG emissions targets to bolster these levels of EV adoption, along with the improvements in internal combustion engine vehicles on which the standards were originally based.
Simply increasing the stringency is insufficient, however. EPA must eliminate the EV “multiplier” in the Phase 2 rule. This multiplier can offset the emission reductions from any EV sale several times over by decreasing the average fuel economy that petroleum-fueled vehicles need to achieve. ACEEE estimates that, assuming the 3% EV sales that are mandated by the states that have already adopted the ACT, the multiplier would effectively reduce the GHG emissions benefit of the standards by at least 40%.
EPA also needs to act to prevent excessive EV multiplier credits earned prior to model year 2027 from being spent on vehicles in subsequent model years; otherwise, the credits from the multiplier can continue to be used, even after it is abolished, and will continue to weaken the standards for the foreseeable future. Model year 2024 through 2026 EV sales combined have the potential to generate EV multiplier credits in excess of the credits from model year 2027.
Meeting the President’s climate mandate
The EPA must take decisive action in its upcoming proposal. This is necessary not only to avert emissions backsliding from outdated credit multipliers, but also to take advantage of the major opportunity that state actions and industry innovation have created to push forward the vehicle market into the future. To ensure that the administration can meet its 50% economy-wide GHG reduction commitment and its pledge to contribute its share to ensuring that global warming is limited to no more than 1.5°C, we need nothing less.

Cities' Clean-Energy Equity Efforts Are Mixed, but Leaders Point the Way Forward;"This blog post is the first in a series taking a closer look at the findings of the 2021 City Clean Energy Scorecard.
Most cities are not doing enough to advance equity as part of their efforts to combat climate change, but cities such as Minneapolis and Chicago have started to take important steps and can serve as models for peers. In our 2021 City Clean Energy Scorecard, the 100 large cities we examined earned an average of only 15% of the points possible for equity-related actions, such as developing energy programs designed to reach communities of color and low-income residents.  
Cities must work to improve the efficiency of all types of buildings—especially those housing communities of color and low-income families—to reach their climate goals and make energy more affordable. On top of bearing the brunt of climate impacts, these communities pay a disproportionate share of their incomes on energy bills, and often live in older homes that are poorly insulated and are not energy efficient. Furthermore, low-income communities and those with fewer resources are less able to improve the efficiency of the buildings they live and work in and adapt to the effects of climate change.
There are ample opportunities for cities to take an equitable approach that ensures all communities can access clean energy programs, that benefits are equitably distributed, and that cities meet their climate targets. As historical patterns of exclusion shape housing and workforce disparities everywhere, including in cities, clean energy efforts that don’t intentionally target equity will often exacerbate inequalities and can leave the most marginalized community members vulnerable. Several cities offer examples of practices that can guide cities in their work.
City Scorecard’s Approach to Gauging Equitable Clean Energy Action
In line with the increasing recognition of the importance of focusing on equity at all levels of government, we’ve added more equity-related metrics and increased the points cities can earn for taking equitable approaches. ACEEE’s approach to recognizing an equitable energy system is outlined in figure 1 below.
The 2021 City Scorecard includes 14 equity-related metrics for which cities could earn a total of 19 points. We measure actions taken by cities in several sectors, including activities like requiring equity assessments for city policies and budgets, providing support for owners of affordable housing to achieve energy performance standards, funding subsidized access to public transportation for low-income communities, and creating utility-administered energy efficiency programs for low-income customers.
Figure 1. Evaluating equitable approaches in the City Scorecard
Cities need to continue to move to outcome-based metrics to ensure accountability to equity. Therefore, the Scorecard includes both metrics that measure city processes and policies and metrics that measure outcomes. For example, cities are scored both on policies requiring affordable housing in transit-oriented developments and on the proportion of their low- and moderate-income residents with access to efficient public transportation.
City Scorecard Findings
A closer look at cities’ performances in individual equity metrics in the City Scorecard provides insight on areas of strength and weakness. Figure 2 highlights the three most frequently pursued equity actions in the City Scorecard, and two actions that were taken by few cities.
Figure 2. Frequency of equity-related actions in the City Scorecard
As figure 2 shows, many cities earned points for local utility offerings for low-income households and multifamily properties and for subsidizing access to efficient transportation options for low-income households. Other than these few metrics, fewer than 50 cities earned any credit for individual equity metrics in the Scorecard. For example, as seen above, only a handful of cities support equitable workforce development in the renewable energy sector or take equitable approaches to locating charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.
Cities have the most room for growth in actions that ensure decisions are made with a recognition of how benefits and harms are distributed in a community. Governments can pursue strategies to address energy inequities as well as the local government’s role in creating these disparities through past policies. They can do this through actions such as adopting comprehensive accountability procedures that analyze the impacts of policies and ensuring that affordable housing is included in development near transit.
Cities Show Leading Models
While all cities have a long way to go to reach their potential to advance equity in their energy work, we profile examples of strong approaches below. Cities can use these to inspire their own work, informed by their own context.
Baltimore requires evaluation of equitable outcomes
In 2018, responding to longstanding, institutionalized inequity in the city, Baltimore lawmakers passed legislation that requires “city agencies to assess existing and proposed policies and practices for disparate outcomes based on race, gender, or income and to proactively develop policies, practices, and investments to prevent and redress those disparate outcomes.” This ordinance requires a staff member in each agency to manage the agency’s participation in the Equity Assessment Program and institutes a requirement for consistent tracking. It also requires the city to conduct an equity assessment with each annual budget as well as an annual equity progress report.
Chicago connects communities to high-quality transit and supports workforce development
The City of Chicago supports a robust public transit system while incentivizing development and affordable housing near transit areas. Chicago’s zoning ordinance offers reduced minimum lot areas, increased height allowances, parking reductions, and other incentives for developers to build near transit.
The city also gives preference to projects located near public transportation when allocating affordable housing funds through its Qualified Allocation Plan process. This helps equitably distribute the benefits of transit to all segments of the community. As a result, using the Center for Neighborhood Technology’s AllTransit tool, ACEEE found that 92% of low-income households in the city have access to high-quality public transit.
Chicago also supports the equitable development of a local clean energy workforce through its PACE program. The program provides low-cost financing for commercial properties to take on clean energy projects. All projects over $2 million are required to meet minority- and women-owned business contracting goals.
Minneapolis directs clean energy work to marginalized areas and supports the creation of affordable passive housing
Minneapolis scored the highest on our City Scorecard equity-related metrics, earning 12 points out of a possible 19. The city takes an innovative approach to directing its clean energy work toward marginalized communities.
The Green Zones initiative identified two geographic areas in the city exposed to disproportionate environmental harm. Committees of residents from each zone then proposed actions that would bring about positive change and plans to build healthy and resilient communities. This approach allows the city to target environmental programming to areas of Minneapolis with the highest concentration of people in need of resources. The Minneapolis Clean Energy Partnership then tracks renewable energy and energy efficiency projects across the city and specifically measures progress in the Green Zones. Data on participation in energy efficiency programs is mapped in annual reports, with the Green Zones specifically outlined.
In addition, the city’s passive house programming in its vacant lot redevelopment assistance program provides funding for 6 to 12 new and affordable, highly energy-efficient homes to be built on vacant city lots, bringing the benefits of efficient and healthy housing to overlooked segments of the community.
Washington, DC, aims to ensure the efficiency of affordable housing without risking displacement of residents
The District of Columbia took a bold step to improve energy performance by requiring buildings to meet building energy performance standards. However, such standards require strategic attention to ensure that affordable housing owners are able to comply and that residents aren’t displaced. Therefore, the District developed the Affordable Housing Retrofit Accelerator to provide financial and technical support for building owners to comply.
The District of Columbia also connects communities to high-quality transportation by requiring affordable housing units to be included in development projects near public transit. Similarly, the District gives preference to projects near transit when considering affordable housing proposals.
By emulating these examples and taking bold action to center equity, cities can answer the call to ensure that all segments of the community are included in their transition to clean energy.

Significant Progress in 2021 but Much More to Do;"The recently announced U.S. fuel economy standards aptly illustrate the past year—significant progress but much more to do. In late December, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued standards requiring cars to average about 40 miles per gallon by model year 2026. While a substantial increase from the approximately 32 mpg standard set by the Trump administration, it is only the beginning of improvements needed to close loopholes and fully decarbonize vehicles in the long term.
Another example is enactment of the federal bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which contains many useful provisions, such as investments in low-income weatherization, industrial assessment centers, and electric vehicle charging. It also invests in public transit but fails to invest enough in shared vehicles or bicycle and pedestrian-friendly options.
Unprecedented additional efficiency investments are in the Build Back Better (BBB) bill. The bill was dealt a blow just before Christmas, but discussions continue on salvaging much of it. BBB is a critical component of the U.S. strategy for meeting the United States’ 2030 climate targets. Getting it across the finish line is probably the leading example of “much more to do.”
ACEEE has been heavily involved in both bills. For example, we helped develop single-family and multifamily building energy retrofit programs and tax credits as well as several industrial provisions in the enacted and pending federal bills.
There are many other examples, including several that aim to reduce energy waste in homes and buildings. The Department of Energy (DOE) has proposed to phase out most incandescent light bulbs, which would finally implement a federal law that the Trump administration had blocked. But due to foot-dragging at the Office of Management and Budget, the rule will not be finalized for a few months. Likewise, DOE still needs to undo a Trump administration process rule—a step partially completed in November—before it can revise outdated efficiency standards for more than 25 types of appliances and equipment, including furnaces and water heaters.
DOE also issued a long-overdue draft efficiency standard for manufactured homes, but the proposal is weak for the lowest-income residents. Two other federal agencies—Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture—have been working to revise out-of-date energy requirements for government-assisted home construction, but they do not expect to issue a proposal until March.
And the federal government appropriated $350 billion for cities and states in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to help address the impacts of the COVID pandemic. Eligible uses include weatherization and climate change mitigation. States and communities are now developing plans on how to use those funds; ACEEE has identified model programs for them.
States and Cities in 2021
States were very active in 2021. Six states—Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, and (in December) New Jersey—passed new energy-saving standards for products not covered by federal standards.
Four states—Colorado, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Illinois—adopted major energy legislation. Colorado adopted the nation’s first requirements for gas utilities to reduce their carbon intensity, with energy efficiency a key strategy. Minnesota updated its energy efficiency programs to better empower and encourage emissions reductions. Massachusetts enacted comprehensive climate legislation that includes a particular focus on environmental justice communities. And Illinois passed comprehensive legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including provisions to expand energy efficiency and related workforce training efforts. In each state, efforts to implement these new laws are just beginning.
Not all states moved forward, however. In November, with the coldest months of the year looming, New Hampshire took a step that will make it more difficult for residents to save energy. Its Public Service Commission rejected a widely supported proposal to expand energy efficiency programs, deciding instead to scale them back in order to nominally reduce utility rates.
Cities have also been active, with Boston and Denver enacting building energy performance standards. Burlington, Vermont, and Gainesville, Florida, made progress in addressing energy consumption by adopting energy efficiency standards for residential rental housing. The just-published ACEEE City Clean Energy Scorecard documented 177 city actions in the past year. San Francisco—the leading city—updated its energy code for residential and commercial buildings and launched a new program providing home-energy-savings kits to those most burdened by pollution. Madison adopted requirements to install electric vehicle chargers in all multifamily and some commercial buildings.
However, as on the federal and state levels, cities need to do more. The City Scorecard found that city efforts to address transportation energy use and emissions were limited and need much more attention. We also found that cities continue to show limited progress toward their community-wide climate goals and need to increase their focus on creating equity-driven clean energy policies and programs.
This was also a very active year for ACEEE. We published 38 reports, white papers, briefs, and fact sheets and have grown to just over 70 staff.  
The Year Ahead
With much uncompleted work, 2022 is likely to be a busy year. A top priority will be efforts to adopt some variation of the Build Back Better bill early in the year. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) has signaled support for some climate and other provisions. Still, finding a package on which all Democrats can agree could be difficult.
Federal agencies, localities, and states will need to do a lot of work to implement the already-passed Energy Act of 2020, ARPA, and the infrastructure bill. For example, DOE is planning to add 1,000 staff and contractors to help it implement its portions of the infrastructure bill. ACEEE plans to be heavily involved in assisting these efforts. 
As 2022 is a federal election year, we don’t expect much legislation from Congress after the first few months. In addition to the funding bills, the federal focus is likely to turn to regulation, including new EPA clean air rules, tentatively scheduled to be proposed in the summer, and more than two dozen appliance standard revisions to be proposed this year.
The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to issue draft corporate climate disclosure rules early in the year. HUD and other agencies will be revising their building energy code requirements, and work will begin on the next round of fuel economy standards for both heavy-duty and light-duty vehicles as well as improved transportation planning requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
At the state level, recent laws will need to be implemented and new laws considered. Washington Governor Jay Inslee has proposed a large climate package, substantial climate legislation is being negotiated in Maryland, and Pennsylvania is poised to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Localities will be developing ARPA plans and considering their own legislation, such as pending building energy performance bills in Montgomery County, Maryland.
And while much of the focus of this post has been on policy, individuals and private companies are also taking many actions to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions. For example, the steel industry is beginning to invest heavily in new steel-making processes with much lower greenhouse gas emissions.
ACEEE’s research finds that energy efficiency can get us halfway to zero carbon by 2050. We made progress in 2021, but we need to make much more this year.

DOE Opens Path to Cut Energy Waste from Gas Furnaces, Water Heaters, Boilers;"Washington, DC—The Biden administration took a key step late Monday toward updating efficiency standards for gas furnaces, water heaters, and boilers—a move that could save consumers money and cut planet-warming emissions. In a final rule, the Department of Energy (DOE) undid a Trump administration action that had blocked its ability to significantly improve efficiency standards for these products, which are the highest energy users in many homes and buildings.
“Getting rid of this roadblock was critical, and now the department’s bigger challenge ahead will be setting strong standards for each of these products,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP). “It’s a really big job and the clock is ticking.”
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), said, “These products are the biggest energy users in many homes, but a lot of the new models sold today needlessly waste energy. This administration has opened the path to ensure the equipment is more efficient, and getting the job done is a must for the climate and for reducing home energy costs.”
Reversing long-standing DOE policy, the Trump administration’s rule had required separate “product classes” for gas equipment that captures and uses some of the heat that would otherwise go up the flue, legally separating these “condensing” models from their less-efficient counterparts. This ensured the continued sale of less-efficient models. That rule was requested in a 2018 rulemaking petition to DOE from the American Gas Association, American Public Gas Association, National Propane Gas Association, Natural Gas Supply Association, and Spire, Inc.
This week’s final rule undoes the Trump action and will allow DOE to consider setting strong standards for each product at issue in individual rulemakings.
Efficiency standards for home gas furnaces have not been meaningfully updated since 1987, and those for home water heaters have not been updated since 2010 (DOE has missed legal deadlines for both). A 2020 ACEEE/ASAP report found that these products are two of the biggest opportunities for the Biden administration’s DOE to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through efficiency standards.
Strengthening standards for the equipment affected by this week’s rule could, by 2035, save households $3 billion annually on their gas utility bills and cut climate change emissions by an amount equal to the total emissions of more than two million typical U.S. homes today, according to the report.
President Biden directed agencies in a January 20 executive order to identify Trump-era actions that merited “suspending, revising, or rescinding,” and to complete action doing so by the end of 2021. DOE identified each of the key Trump rollbacks and roadblocks, including the one undone this week, in its memo.
DOE still needs to finalize a proposal undoing Trump-era process hurdles related to setting new standards (it recently finalized a rule undoing several of these hurdles). And it must take final action to undo Trump-era rollbacks on standards for light bulbs, clothes washers and dryers, and dishwashers.
As of Inauguration Day this year, DOE had missed 28 legal deadlines for considering new standards. By January 2025, another 19 will come due, meaning that the new administration has 4 years to consider updating standards for 47 product categories.

Biden's Auto Standards Set Stage for Transformative Progress Ahead;"Washington, DC—The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy released the following statement from Avi Mersky, senior transportation researcher, in response to the Environmental Protection Agency’s revised standards for cars and light trucks through model year 2026:
“The standards announced today will reverse much of the damage of the Trump administration’s rollback and save consumers money. They are more stringent than the proposed version and will enable the administration to develop more-ambitious rules next year to meet the president’s climate pledges.
“In particular, the new rule envisions significant electric vehicle sales by 2026, and the administration will need to embrace that imperative as it begins developing the next standard.
“While today’s standards improve substantially upon the proposal, loopholes in the standards mean that the emissions reductions will be about a quarter lower than they otherwise would be. An all-hands-on-deck approach for the climate will mean doing away with these giveaways next time.”
ACEEE submitted comments to EPA in September on its proposed standards, calling for the agency to set the standards at a more stringent level and remove a number of proposed incentives, credits, and multipliers that would reduce their effective stringency.

Report: Deep Retrofits Can Halve Homes’ Energy Use and Emissions;"Scaling Them to Address Climate Crisis Requires Federal Support
Upgrading homes with thick insulation, thorough air sealing, efficient heat pumps, and other measures can more than halve their energy use and planet-warming emissions, offering a win-win opportunity to improve residents’ comfort, lower their utility bills, and address the climate crisis, according to a report released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). The report shows that, to rapidly scale these retrofits, federal support is needed to offset upfront costs.
Deep retrofits that include a robust package of such upgrades can cut a home’s energy use by 58% to 79% and its emissions by 32% to 56%, depending on the home’s age and regional climate. They include simple measures, such as switching to LED light bulbs or buying insulated shades, and costlier ones, such as replacing the furnace, the windows, and the roof. For longer-term carbon reductions, they also include a shift to electric heating and cooling, notably via heat pumps. Such retrofits improve indoor air quality, even out temperatures, and reduce noise, but at $42,600 to $56,750, they cost more than most homeowners can afford.
“Simple steps deliver great bang for the buck, but if we’re serious about climate action, we need to do a lot more and make deep retrofits affordable and accessible to millions of homes,” says Jennifer Amann, the report’s lead author and a senior fellow in ACEEE’s buildings program. “The government needs to help scale these retrofits by subsidizing them, training contractors, and encouraging electrification.”
  To guide potential government investments and boost customer interest, the report analyzed retrofit packages based on the most common pre-2000 home type in each major U.S. climate zone. It looked at breaking these packages into two stages to better manage their costs and meet customer needs. The analysis shows that completing retrofits in stages can be an effective strategy for scaling deep retrofits and achieving energy and carbon savings.
“One solution does not fit all,” says Dr. Rohini Srivastava, report co-author and an ACEEE senior researcher. She adds, “A home’s age and region matter. An old home in cold Chicago may need a different and more extensive mix of upgrades than a newer home in temperate Seattle.”
The report finds:
·        Older homes in cold, mixed-humid, and marine climates benefit most from envelope upgrades (e.g., new windows; attic, wall, floor insulation) that can significantly cut energy use and emissions. A staged approach that prioritizes such upgrades delivers near-term gas savings, with more savings in later phases when HVAC and water heating are electrified. 
·        For newer homes in hot-humid and hot-dry climates, new HVAC equipment and select envelope measures (e.g., attic insulation) can reduce heating and cooling loads and contribute to energy and carbon savings.
·        High-efficiency heat pumps and heat pump water heaters present the best opportunity for electrification when heating loads are smaller.
  “Consumers can benefit by taking any of these approaches,” Amann says. “If they have an old and dying HVAC system, switching to an efficient electric heat pump along with air sealing and attic insulation may be good first steps. Rather than doing everything in the perfect order, it’s more important that they get started and do something.” She notes that less expensive measures, such as storm windows or insulated shades, ceiling fans, and high efficiency dehumidifiers, can quickly reduce energy use and emissions while improving residents’ comfort.
Rapid scaling of deep retrofits is needed to meet U.S. and global climate goals. A 2021 International Energy Agency report projects that existing residential buildings need to be retrofitted at the rate of 2.5% each year to reach the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.
While the technology for deep retrofits exists, the report notes several barriers that limit its adoption: a lack of standardized insulation packages that reduce time and error; a limited range of heat pump products that deliver high-efficiency at lower cost; and the limited use of passive technologies that decrease building loads. In addition, most contractors are not yet ready to undertake a deep retrofit’s complexity, nor are homeowners ready for its costs.
To address these challenges, the report recommends that energy efficiency programs standardize retrofit packages, split upgrades into two or more phases, include electrification, and offer both financing and incentives.

Scorecard: Cities’ Climate Efforts Held Back by Lagging Transportation Initiatives;"San Francisco Takes Top Spot in Clean Energy Rankings for First Time
  Washington, DC—Most large U.S. cities have yet to institute strong policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, and they are not on track to meet their climate goals for the sector—or have yet to set any—according to the 2021 City Clean Energy Scorecard. The report, released Wednesday by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), ranks 100 major U.S. cities on efforts including reducing energy waste in homes and buildings and moving toward a cleaner power grid—and doing so equitably. It identifies the leading cities, the most improved, and those with ample room for progress, citing opportunities for each to advance.
Register for the report webinar today, Dec. 15 at 2 pm ET, featuring San Francisco Mayor London Breed and sustainability directors from Madison, Washington DC, and SF
San Francisco took top honors for the first time in this sixth edition of the Scorecard, followed by Seattle (#2), Washington, DC (#3), Minneapolis (#4), and Boston and New York (tied for #5). San Francisco launched a new program that provides free home energy-saving kits to residents in areas that are disproportionately burdened by multiple sources of pollution and are economically disadvantaged. The city also updated its energy code for new residential and commercial buildings with requirements that will reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and it was the top scorer on transportation policies.
Cities earned credit for policies and programs such as requiring large buildings to reduce energy waste or subsidizing access to transit and other efficient transportation options for historically marginalized groups, and for their success in reducing their overall greenhouse gas emissions.
For the first time, ACEEE assessed cities’ progress toward their climate goals for the transportation sector—which are based on either greenhouse gas emissions or vehicle miles travelled—using a comprehensive review of their reported data. Twenty-five cities have adopted such goals, and only three are on track to achieve them. Seventeen of the 25 cities could not provide sufficient data to assess their progress. San Diego showed the strongest progress in this category, achieving a nearly 3% annual reduction in transportation greenhouse gas emissions since 2015.
The report also found that cities’ most recent clean energy policy actions have primarily focused on sectors other than transportation. Of the 177 new city clean energy actions scored in the report, only 23 were related to transportation, which is responsible for the largest share of U.S. emissions.
“Most cities haven’t set a goal for reducing vehicle travel or transportation emissions, and of those that have, only a few show progress, so that points to a big area for improvement,” said Stefen Samarripas, local policy manager at ACEEE and lead author of the report. “From investments in transit to incentives for installing electric vehicle charging stations and zoning changes that allow dense, mixed-use development, cities have to use all their tools to support an affordable transportation system that works better for all while slashing greenhouse gas emissions.”
Cities continued to show limited progress toward meeting their overall community-wide climate goals. While 63 have adopted such a goal, only 38 have released sufficient data to assess their progress, and of these, only 19 are on track to achieve their goals.
This year’s report uses new and expanded criteria to assess cities’ commitment to race and social equity in energy policies, finding that only 30 of cities’ 177 new clean energy actions were equity-driven. An increasing number of cities have initiated procedures that give historically marginalized communities ways to provide input, make certain decisions, and hold their local government accountable on clean energy strategies, but few have created equity-driven clean energy policies and programs, and much more is needed.
The new equity measures in the report include credit for several city initiatives including policies such as mandating efficiency upgrades for affordable housing while offering financial or technical assistance to help building owners comply and ensuring that owners of affordable housing who receive city retrofit incentives keep improved units affordable for those with low incomes. Only seven cities were able to earn half or more of the available points on measures of equity.
Minneapolis scored the highest on equity. The city’s Green Zones Initiative identified two areas of the city that have been disproportionately affected by environmental pollution and convened task forces of community members to create five-year plans for sustainably supporting their communities.
The report, which evaluated cities from May 2, 2020, to July 1, 2021, also found:
·       The top five cities were separated by only 4.5 points.
·       Rounding out the top 10 cities are Denver (#7), Los Angeles (#8), San José (#9), and Oakland (#10).
·       Seattle’s advocacy in the state legislature allowed its municipal utility to expand its electric vehicle charging initiatives; Washington, DC earned points for incentivizing the purchase of new electric vehicles by waiving the excise taxes on them.
·       Madison (Wisconsin) (#39), Charlotte (#42), and Honolulu (#24) are this year’s most-improved cities. Madison increased its investments in renewable energy and adopted requirements to install electric vehicle chargers in all multifamily and some commercial buildings. Charlotte created a program to train energy efficiency and renewable energy workers and directed city agencies to purchase efficient vehicles. Honolulu adopted a new climate action plan.
·       Many cities dropping in rank fell by not keeping up with peers who have adopted leading clean energy practices, increasingly rewarded in the Scorecard’s metrics.
·       Many cities encountered funding, staffing, and operational challenges for their clean energy efforts because of the COVID-19 pandemic, though a small number adapted their operations and plans quickly and effectively. Overall, the pandemic slowed many cities’ actions through 2020, but efforts generally recovered in the first half of 2021 with a renewed focus on the buildings sector.
“COVID relief and infrastructure funds from Congress provide a big opportunity for all cities to step up their efforts,” said Samarripas. “Cities can invest in upgrading buildings to cut costly energy waste. They can invest in efficient transportation, including public transit, to help lower-income residents reduce their travel costs and protect the climate. The leading cities provide helpful models for those at much earlier stages of their efforts.”
San Francisco Mayor London N. Breed said: “I’m so proud of the all the work we’ve done in San Francisco to achieve the top City Clean Energy ranking this year. Thanks to consistent investments in our city’s clean energy program, innovative policies to decarbonize our buildings, and advancing environmental solutions centered around equity, we’ve shown that it’s possible to drastically reduce our carbon emissions while growing our population and economy. I’m looking forward to our continued work with ACEEE and cities around the nation to continue striving toward bold climate action.”
Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said: “Madison is deeply committed to combatting climate change by investing in energy efficiency, clean energy, and sustainable transportation. Our investment in bus rapid transit is key to moving our economy forward in a low-carbon way. Our Green Power solar workforce training program is preparing people for good, green jobs while moving us toward our goal of 100% renewable energy for city operations. And our fleet is moving quickly to reduce emissions, including bringing the nation’s first all-electric fire truck into service. But we’re not resting on our laurels, because we know how important it is for every city to lead on climate.”
  The Scorecard ranks cities in five policy areas: 
·       Community-wide initiatives. Seattle earned the top score in this category; it is on track to achieve its 2030 emissions reduction goal. It requires all policies and programs to complete a Racial Equity Toolkit at their inception.
·       Buildings policies. Denver scored highest, with its stringent building energy codes and enforcement of them. The city requires all new residential construction to be equipped for the installation of solar panels, and it partners with a local organization to train workers in installing them.
·       Transportation policies. San Francisco took the top spot. To make more housing available near transit, it has allowed increased building height and density in transit-rich locations.
·       Energy and water utilities. Boston topped this category; the energy utilities that serve the city save significant amounts of energy through their efficiency programs for customers, and a network of providers helps low-income households make energy-saving improvements.
·       Local government operations. Boston, Orlando, Portland, and San Francisco tied for first place. They are on track to substantially reduce municipal greenhouse gas emissions with ongoing investments to create energy-efficient vehicle fleets, install renewable energy systems, and retrofit their buildings.
For the first time, the Scorecard grouped cities into six types based on the population of their metropolitan areas and their rates of growth, allowing for an examination of trends across city types.
The Scorecard includes a new analysis and scoring of cities’ smart growth strategies and a new tool (developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) to quantify the potential of a city’s transportation system to connect people to services and activities in an energy-efficient, convenient, and cost-effective way.
The Scorecard is accompanied by individual fact sheets that describe each city’s performance and recommend ways to improve.
The Scorecard evaluated the largest cities in the country’s most populous metropolitan areas, together with the second-largest cities in those areas if their population exceeds 250,000. It is based on data collected from cities, utilities, and numerous publicly available sources. Staff from all 100 cities were given the opportunity to comment on a draft of the findings.

Here to Stay: Remote Home Assessments Prove Popular Option for Energy Upgrades;"Remote home energy assessments are an excellent alternative to in-person assessments and will likely continue after the pandemic ends, according to a report released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). Well liked by customers, they can expand the reach of energy efficiency and encourage energy-saving upgrades.
Register for the Report Webinar on January 12
In a remote assessment, homeowners typically use their smartphones to walk the energy assessor through the home while the assessor collects data. At the end of the session or during a follow-up phone call a few days later, the assessor goes over the findings and recommendations, usually including a summary report. Customers generally report the process to be convenient, straightforward, and easy, saying they learned more about their homes.
While the idea of remote assessments has been around for some time, it wasn’t until the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that they started to become more prevalent. Initially used to continue reaching customers during the pandemic, the remote assessments allowed many efficiency workers to remain employed and showed promise in reducing program costs. Fewer transportation demands and a larger customer base, including formerly hard-to-reach households, can save programs time and money and increase the number of homes assessed.
Combining remote assessments with in-person assessments can be particularly effective when the former are used as a screening tool to determine which, if any, upgrades may be needed before sending a contractor to the home. A screening can also help determine what type of specialized contractor should visit.
Not only are remote assessments convenient for both customers and energy assessors, they create greater customer engagement than in-person ones. Because they require customers to lead the assessor around the home, the process is inherently engaging for homeowners, and the assessor has more opportunities to educate them about their home and recommended upgrades. This direct engagement can increase the likelihood of conversion, or the follow-through on recommendations.
ACEEE’s report finds that the best candidates for remote assessments appear to be younger, more tech-savvy customers, as they reported significantly higher overall satisfaction compared to in-person and fewer technical issues. They also tended to follow through with recommended upgrades and installed free items (e.g., lightbulbs, power strips) more often than older customers, especially those age 65 or older (for whom satisfaction with remote assessments declined more than 13% compared to in-person assessments). Remote assessments require a good Wi-Fi connection throughout the home and customer ability to move from room to room. If customers cannot meet such criteria, an in-person assessment is most likely better.
ACEEE’s report highlights behavioral techniques that can increase the effectiveness of remote (and in-person) assessments. For example, empathizing and developing rapport with customers and tailoring the assessment and recommendations to each customer’s individual concerns can go a long way to persuading customers to follow through with suggested upgrades.
Providing reasons why upgrades are recommended (why they should do it), and using vivid, real-world analogies (“not cleaning refrigerator coils is like asking your fridge to breathe through a paper bag”) can also help customers understand the magnitude of their energy waste and the importance of the recommended upgrades.
ACEEE has created a contractor tip sheet summarizing these and other suggestions. The report provides more information and examples of how assessments can apply these techniques. Check out the report and tip sheet. To learn more, please register for our free webinar next month on remote assessments.

DOE Moves Toward Ensuring Light Bulbs Save Energy, but Hurdles Remain;"Washington, DC—The Biden administration took a major step late Friday toward ensuring most new light bulbs do not waste the bulk of the energy they use, but it is unclear how long inefficient bulbs will remain on the market. The Department of Energy (DOE) proposed to require that everyday light bulbs meet an efficiency standard—easily achieved by today’s LEDs—that had been set to take effect last year before the Trump administration prevented it from doing so. 
Each additional month that light bulb standards are delayed costs consumers nearly $300 million in needless energy bills and causes 800,000 tons of preventable carbon dioxide emissions over the lifetime of the inefficient bulbs sold in that month. 
DOE is now certain to miss a year-end deadline for finalizing the rule; it hasn’t yet begun a 45-day comment period on the proposal. In an inauguration day executive order, President Biden directed DOE to consider “suspending, revising, or rescinding” Trump-era rules that conflict with his climate objectives. DOE in February identified rules it would review and take final action on by a year-end deadline in the order, including President Trump’s two major light bulb efficiency rollbacks. 
Bulb manufacturers requested earlier this year that DOE allow for potentially years of continued sales even after the rule is finalized. The new proposal calls for unspecified “enforcement discretion” and floats a “staggered implementation” approach. 
“This progress is welcome news for consumers and for the planet, but the administration is not acting here with the urgency needed to address the climate crisis,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “The department needs to get this finalized and ensure compliance rapidly because every day manufacturers are making more energy-wasting bulbs for sale.” 
Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), said, “It’s time to get this done. The manufacturers have already received a couple extra years beyond Congress’s deadline to sell bulbs that have a short lifespan and waste a lot of energy. Now they’re pushing for more. The department needs to remember that any extra time it takes and compliance flexibility it gives come at the expense of consumers and the climate.” 
While sales of LED bulbs have grown rapidly, the newest data available show that about 30% of light bulbs sold nationally in 2020 were still incandescent or halogen incandescent bulbs, which both turn most of the electrical energy they use into heat, not light. 
The proposed rule would provide $3.7 billion in annualized total net benefits in today’s dollars, according to DOE, including $2.9 billion in annualized net cost savings for consumers, complemented by the social benefits from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants from power plants. The DOE found that the proposal would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 222 million metric tons over thirty years. 
The rule would require that bulbs produce at least 45 lumens per watt (a measure of how much visible light is produced for a given amount of electricity) by reinstating a ""backstop"" standard mandated by Congress in a bipartisan 2007 law. The Obama administration’s DOE determined the legal backstop had been triggered, setting the stage for the standard to take effect at the beginning of 2020. 
After Trump entered office, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)—representing major light bulb manufacturers (Philips [now known as Signify], General Electric, and Sylvania/LEDVANCE)—sued DOE over the Obama determination and a related rule concerning which types of bulbs must meet the standards. The Trump administration settled with NEMA that year, committing to revisit the issue. DOE issued two final rules in 2019, one asserting that the backstop standard had not been triggered and the other exempting types of bulbs that the Obama administration had determined should be covered by standards. 
This year, light bulb manufacturers have called for a continued period of sales for halogen and incandescent bulbs should the new proposal be finalized. In June, NEMA submitted comments to DOE asking the agency for another year to continue manufacturing and importing inefficient bulbs, followed by a year more to sell stockpiled inventory. Signify, the world's largest lighting company, seconded the request for more time to make or import wasteful bulbs, followed by the ability to sell the bulbs for a to-be-determined period. The People’s Republic of China called for a “transition period of at least three years.” 
The department separately proposed in August to ensure that federal light bulb standards cover not only pear-shaped A-type bulbs but several other common types that the Obama administration had determined should be included, such as reflector bulbs used in recessed and track lighting, candle-shaped bulbs used in wall sconces and other decorative light fixtures, and globe-shaped bulbs often installed in bathrooms. That proposal also has a year-end deadline for finalization.

Utilities Need to Revamp Their Energy-Saving Efforts to Meet Climate Goals;"Utilities’ energy efficiency programs have a proven record doing what they were originally intended to do: save energy. But that mission isn’t quite the same as one focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. States and utilities should seriously consider redirecting their efficiency efforts toward tackling the climate crisis, according to an ACEEE report released today.
As one of the main sources of U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—second only to transportation—the power sector knows it has a responsibility to change. It’s why more than 50 U.S. utilities have announced carbon-free or net-zero targets. Yet few are on a path to meet their targets, according to a Sierra Club study.
Utility energy efficiency (EE) programs, which offer customers incentives to make energy-saving home and business improvements, have for decades been designed to prioritize the financial benefits, to both the utilities and their customers, that come with reducing energy waste. Our report lays out a new framework for these programs that, in addition to energy savings, prioritizes environmental protection, equity, and economic development. We are calling this framework climate-forward efficiency.
We identify climate-forward efforts as those that
Treat EE as an intentional driver of GHG reduction.
Scale to meet the magnitude of the decarbonization goals in policy and utility corporate commitments.
Leverage EE as a tool to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change on customers by advancing equity, enhancing resilience, and improving health outcomes.
Prioritize EE investments based on their time, seasonal, and geographic impacts.
Enable prioritization of investments across fuels, systems, and sectors, particularly from electrification.
The growing role of renewable energy in the electric grid is changing what is needed from energy efficiency. Because the set of generating power plants that produce electricity at any given moment changes regularly, so too will the avoided emissions achieved through energy efficiency. For example, at midday in spring in California, solar production is high and system load is low. One MWh saved during these hours will result in roughly half the emissions savings of one MWh saved at night in summer or in winter, when those conditions are reversed. Yet conventional EE programs, which measure success based only upon the MWh savings per year, cannot distinguish between those two cases.
As more renewable power comes online, utilities should be allowed to incentivize customers to switch from equipment powered by fossil fuels to more-efficient electric-powered models when appropriate from an environmental and economic perspective, a transition referred to as fuel switching. Replacing an old propane furnace with an electric heat pump, rather than just a more-efficient furnace, can save energy and reduce emissions. Yet many energy efficiency programs are currently discouraged or prohibited from incentivizing efficient fuel switching. 
Without intervention, affluent customers are likely to be the first to adopt climate-forward technologies (e.g., electric vehicles). To avoid exacerbating existing inequities, utility programs must focus on reaching low-income customers, customers of color, and those most at risk from climate change during this transition. If states and utilities fail to prioritize these communities for building envelope and HVAC upgrades, they risk stranding them on shrinking fossil fuel systems, causing these communities to face higher rates and other inequities.
Utilities’ energy efficiency investments are dependent on state and occasionally federal or local policies, each of which may require changes to maximize GHG reductions from customer programs. Our new report offers a set of nine principles for states and utilities to consider when establishing metrics that capture progress toward equitable decarbonization and economic development:
State/corporate alignment. Metrics should facilitate direct comparisons to state and utility climate policy commitments.
Cumulative emissions. Metrics should capture full lifecycle impact of climate-forward efficiency measures on carbon emissions.
Accuracy. Metrics should match the level of detail required by policy goals.
Inclusivity. Metrics should capture emissions reductions that result from all types of climate-forward efficiency activities.
Market transformation. Metrics should capture progress toward market transformation activities that will drive long-term emissions reductions beyond those that maximize direct reductions in the immediate program cycle.
Equity. Metrics should capture progress toward equity goals established in state policy.
Robust development. Metrics should be developed transparently with participation from all stakeholders, especially those who are traditionally underrepresented.
Data pipeline. Metrics should be supported by access to sufficient data to calculate metrics for the duration of the programs.
Avoid perverse incentives. Metrics should not incentivize sub-optimal resource acquisition or unwanted activities (e.g., importing electricity with high carbon content).
A few leading states are already taking steps to redefine the range of incentives that qualify as efficiency and modify how they measure success. Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland, for example, have already adopted or are considering savings goals that apply across fuel types. Vermont and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District have adopted a common metric of avoided GHG emissions for efficiency and electrification programs. Starting in 2024, California’s investor-owned utilities will begin to capture all cost-effective energy efficiency as measured by the state’s Total System Benefit metric, which puts a dollar value on the life-cycle energy, capacity, and GHG reductions that a measure provides to the electric and natural gas systems. 
In a companion report in early 2022, ACEEE will provide a roadmap for how states, utilities, and regulators can build on that momentum and ensure that utilities are realizing the potential of energy efficiency as a climate change mitigation tool.

DOE Nixes Key Trump-Era Roadblocks for Updating Appliance Efficiency Standards;"  Washington, DC—The Biden administration finalized a rule today that will help enable it to cut greenhouse gas emissions by updating energy-saving standards for dozens of types of appliances and equipment. The Department of Energy (DOE) action undoes key provisions of a Trump administration “process rule” that had set hurdles for updating standards.
“This removes some of the big roadblocks the previous administration left behind, and now the Department has several more to finish tackling. Undoing all these hurdles will clear the way for the Department to really get moving on updating the standards for dozens of types of appliances and equipment,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said: “This administration came in with a backlog of standards that hadn’t been updated for years, as well as a series of hurdles placed in front of it. Time is of the essence because every extra month it takes to update a standard, inefficient products are sold that hurt the climate and saddle people with needless energy costs.”
The Trump administration’s process rule, finalized in 2020, added more time-consuming steps and other hurdles to DOE’s already lengthy standard-setting process. Today’s final rule would remove several of these key hurdles. It would return the process rule to nonbinding guidance status, eliminate the strict minimum energy savings threshold for DOE to set a standard, loosen the requirements to adhere to manufacturer-developed testing procedures, and reinstate the potential for a stakeholder negotiation process that enables quicker standard setting in some instances. It would also eliminate a requirement to conduct a comparative analysis of potential standards that conflicts with statute and a mandatory 180-day waiting period between a test procedure final rule and a proposal for a new standard.
DOE still needs to finalize a separate proposal to undo several additional hurdles in the Trump administration’s process rule not addressed in today’s final rule. That proposal would undo: a provision that made it difficult for DOE to set standards for commercial heating and cooling equipment that are stronger than those set by an industry professional society in which product manufacturers have a strong voice; a provision mandating that DOE conduct multiple rulemaking steps before even proposing an updated standard; and a provision requiring DOE to conduct a “coverage determination” process before initiating a rulemaking to set a standard for a product for the first time, even though information learned during the rulemaking process has traditionally itself informed the coverage determination.
DOE also needs to finalize a proposal to undo a rule that effectively blocks DOE from setting strong standards for gas furnaces, water heaters, and boilers in homes and commercial building. And DOE needs to take final action to undo Trump-era rollbacks on standards for lightbulbs, clothes washers and dryers, dishwashers, and showerheads, and a rule allowing manufacturers to write their own test procedures for evaluating the efficiency of products.
President Biden directed agencies in a January 20 executive order to identify Trump-era actions that merited “suspending, revising, or rescinding,” and to complete action doing so by the end of 2021. DOE identified each of the Trump rollbacks and roadblocks in its memo.
As of Inauguration Day this year, DOE had missed 28 legal deadlines for considering new standards. By January 2025, another 19 will come due, meaning that the new administration has 4 years to consider updating standards for 47 products.

Weak Auto Efficiency Progress Shows EPA Needs to Rein in “Flexibilities”;"Washington, DC—The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy released the following statement from Avi Mersky, senior transportation researcher, in response to EPA’s 2021 Automotive Trends Report. This report shows that 2020 model year vehicles fell far short of the 4.3% annual efficiency improvements targeted in federal standards: 
“The automakers’ performance presented in the EPA report is a big disappointment. We’re facing a climate crisis, yet automakers are producing cars that are barely more fuel efficient on average than what they sold a year earlier, even as technology improves. They’re following the letter of the standards but exploiting all the weaknesses in the regulation to keep making gas guzzlers. It's terrible for the climate and it costs drivers at the pump, especially now as gas prices are increasing.
“EPA has a critical opportunity in its pending update of vehicle efficiency standards to eliminate the various incentives, credit schemes, and multipliers that the manufacturers inevitably exploit. The agency can learn the lesson and eliminate these ’flexibilities’ to help ensure the targets it sets now are actually met.
“The problem is compounded by the automaker-led shift to larger, heavier, and more-expensive vehicles. Fuel standards are set by vehicle size, allowing automakers to repeatedly miss the topline fuel economy targets. In future standards, EPA should put a floor on year-over-year increases in average efficiency, regardless of trends in vehicle size.”
Background 
Today’s EPA report shows that 2020 model year light-duty vehicles had an average fuel economy of 25.4 miles per gallon, a 2.0% improvement over 2019 vehicles. Federal standards for 2020 model year vehicles—finalized in 2012—targeted a 4.3% improvement over the previous year’s vehicles. The Trump administration’s SAFE rule weakened standards only for subsequent model years.
ACEEE submitted comments to EPA in September on its proposed standards for model year 2023-2026 vehicles, calling for the agency to remove a number of proposed incentives, credits, and multipliers that would reduce the effective stringency of the standards.

ACEEE Seeks Partners to Tap $1B in Federal Funds to Improve Home Health and Efficiency;"As people grapple with rising energy prices this winter, states can take steps to help. They can tap nearly a billion dollars in federal funding—via the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)—to remedy home health issues, such as lead and mold, as part of broader energy-saving weatherization services that will also reduce utility bills.
No state has yet fully seized this opportunity to address energy efficiency in tandem with health. Today, ACEEE is building on its prior research by launching an initiative to help a small group of states that sign up as partners to pursue CHIP funding to incorporate health measures into energy efficiency programs. Many states have unused CHIP funds that could be matched to address health needs via weatherization.
Home weatherization is an opportunity to not only improve the health of vulnerable communities but also curb both utility bills and greenhouse gas emissions. Many energy programs are now looking to leverage links between housing, energy, and health to retrofit more homes.   
Promoting Health and Equity through Residential Program Design
This issue is critical because housing impacts health. Unhealthy living conditions can contribute to discomfort, serious respiratory illnesses such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and even early death. Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous communities are disproportionately likely to face inadequate housing conditions, and in turn face higher rates of these housing-related harms.
Energy utility shutoffs also cause harm, especially to vulnerable groups like newborns and older people who are at higher risk of injury or death from uncomfortably hot or cold temperatures. High energy bills from inefficient housing put families with limited resources at greater risk for these shutoffs, as well as for tradeoffs between critical temperature control and other necessities, like food and prescription medication.
Physical changes to homes, such as improved air sealing and ventilation, from a weatherization program can improve energy efficiency and provide health and social benefits, such as mold remediation, asthma mitigation, and safety measures that help older adults age in place.
Designing energy efficiency programs to maximize their health benefits can broaden and strengthen the case for funding this work.
Unlocking Opportunities to Expand In-Home Services and Improve Children’s Health
To seize opportunities for increased weatherization, ACEEE began providing training earlier this year to program administrators across the country seeking to incorporate health into residential energy efficiency program design. We brought together hundreds of program implementers and other advocates and distilled our research into guidance materials for the group.
As a next step, we are now seeking to support a small cohort of states in developing partnerships and plans for a Health Services Initiative (HSI)—a flexible mechanism through CHIP to fund programs that address unmet health needs. Many states have unused CHIP funds that could be matched to support HSIs, but few have taken advantage of this option.
States have used HSIs to fund programs as different from one another as in-school vision screenings, special care for new mothers, and services to support homeless youth. Several, including Maryland and Michigan, are already using HSIs to improve health by modifying housing, particularly for lead remediation. Yet so far none have used HSIs to address health needs in a way that also delivers energy benefits.
ACEEE will support a small group of states to explore using HSIs to fund cross-cutting health and energy programs. We will provide technical assistance to state partners to identify and develop needed partnerships, plan out key program elements, identify appropriate matching funds, and ultimately submit a CHIP State Plan Amendment to establish an HSI. We will regularly meet with these state representatives over the next year to troubleshoot common challenges and identify lessons learned to share with others.
We invite you to reach out to us here to join this initiative or learn more about this opportunity.

Report: Efficient Electric Water Heating Could Slash Multifamily Buildings’ Carbon Emissions;"  Efficient electric water heaters in multifamily buildings cause less than half the greenhouse gas emissions of gas-fired products, presenting a key climate opportunity, according to a study released today. The report by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) and New Buildings Institute (NBI)—which arrives at a time of rising natural gas prices—calls for policymakers to ramp up efforts to help building owners replace old equipment. Ecotope and the Association for Energy Affordability served as data partners for the report.
Heating water efficiently is critical because in multifamily buildings with five or more units water heating uses more energy than space heating, cooling, or lighting. The new analysis shows that converting gas-fired water heaters to advanced technology—electric heat pump water heaters (HPWHs)—would cut the greenhouse gas emissions the equipment is responsible for by an average of 58%. If powered entirely by clean sources, HPWHs cause zero emissions, making them a critical tool for decarbonizing the economy.
These replacements will likely remain limited, largely because of their higher upfront cost unless policymakers act. Building owners lack the incentive to invest in these technologies, especially if tenants are paying the energy bill.
“Gas water heaters are the biggest energy users in multifamily buildings, but most owners don’t have the incentive to switch to a more efficient electric option,” said Amruta Khanolkar, senior project manager at NBI and report co-author.
Hannah Bastian, research analyst at ACEEE and fellow co-author, said, “We need to get this critical carbon-cutting technology into millions of buildings. We need new utility programs, tax incentives, and training for contractors to install these water heaters, and quickly. Today’s natural gas prices are a reminder that relying on energy with big cost fluctuations can be a real risk for those paying the utility bills.”
Multifamily buildings can heat water through in-unit equipment or a central system, either of which can use electric heat pumps. Replacing all the gas water heaters that are now in multifamily buildings nationwide with electric heat pumps would save 175 trillion British thermal units per year of energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an amount equivalent to what is emitted by 1.4 million passenger vehicles, the report finds.
Heat pump water heaters, when connected to the electric grid, can also shift electricity consumption from hours of peak demand to times of low demand. For example, they can heat water in the middle of the day when solar energy production is high in some regions, and stop heating in the early evening when many residents return home and electricity demand generally peaks. They effectively serve as thermal batteries—reducing strains on the electric grid and helping enable the widespread use of renewable energy. The report finds that HPWH in multifamily buildings could together potentially store 3.5 terawatt hours of energy—an amount equal to the electricity used by 325,000 homes over a full year.
“Heat pumps not only cut greenhouse gases but can heat the water at times when the electric grid has plenty of renewable energy and store it to be used when the grid is strained,” said Khanolkar.
The report finds that there are cost challenges when replacing gas products with HPWHs in multifamily applications. They are largest in cold climates and regions with low gas prices or high electricity costs, such as the Mid-Atlantic states. Federal, regional, and utility financial incentives and policy changes are key to support the adoption of HPWHs in multifamily buildings.
The analysis was based on data from the federal Residential Energy Consumption Survey. The report accounts for direct greenhouse gas emissions from gas equipment and for the emissions from power plants providing the electricity used by heat pumps. The emissions attributed to the electricity were based on average 2030 projected power sector emissions in each region from the Energy Information Agency’s Annual Energy Outlook reference case.
Congress could soon make a significant step forward: the latest version of the pending Build Back Better investment plan would provide rebates and larger tax credits for HPWHs (as well as for other efficient equipment). Yet more federal, state, and local policy initiatives will be necessary.
Many utilities offer incentives for building or unit owners to install in-unit heat pump hot water heaters, but few programs are designed specifically for multifamily buildings, which offer unique challenges; these projects can be complex and owners lack the capital and time to pursue them. Also, several states’ laws and regulations fail to encourage—or outright prohibit—incentivizing switches from fossil fuel equipment to electrified equipment.
The report identifies five utility programs models across the United States that specifically incentivize HPWH technology in multifamily buildings and could provide models for other utilities. It recommends that:
Utilities create new programs to incentivize adoption of electric HPWHs and consider electricity rate schemes that incentivize heating water when power is abundant on the grid.
States and utility regulators enable utility programs that incentivize electrification.
Federal and state governments offer or expand tax credits.
Utilities help train contractors to install electric HPWHs.
Manufacturers research and develop increasingly efficient models.

New Hampshire Regulators Order Drastic Cuts in Utility Energy Efficiency Funding;"As the coldest months of the year approach, New Hampshire has taken a worrisome step backward that will make it harder for residents to save energy. In a radical departure from the state’s prior progress, its Public Utilities Commission issued an order late Friday that slashes funding for utility energy efficiency programs. The order would cut their budgets nearly in half by 2023, compared to 2020 levels—depriving New Hampshire residents and businesses of much-needed help in reducing their utility bills as natural gas and electricity prices rise.
Today many New Hampshire residents can receive rebates for upgrading to more efficient home heating systems, financing for home weatherization, and other incentives. But those programs will now likely be cut back.
Given recent headlines about rising energy prices, and coming on the heels of further news about the urgency of the climate crisis from the COP 26 summit in Glasgow, this move is out of step with the rising focus on the importance of energy efficiency.
Moreover, what makes this move particularly unusual and disappointing is that the Commission had before it a proposed settlement agreement that actually significantly increased utility energy efficiency funding from present levels. As I mentioned in a blog post in January, that settlement plan was supported by every formal party to the case, including all the state’s utilities (Eversource, Liberty, Unitil, and the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative), the state residential ratepayer advocate, and a number of nonprofit organizations.
Testimony in that case indicated that the expanded efficiency programs in that settlement would have created 17,500 job-years and produced $3.5 billion in increased economic output in New Hampshire. Although not a party to the case, the Business and Industry Association (BIA) filed a comment letter opposing the proposed increase in funding and calling for funding to stay at current levels. But the Commission ultimately went much farther than that.
Rather than approving the consensus settlement, or even freezing funding at current levels, the Commission chose on its own initiative to completely reverse course and dramatically scale back utility efficiency funding. In its order, the Commission reached way back to invoke a 1998 order that called for the development of “market based, not utility-sponsored and ratepayer-funded, energy efficiency programs.” (The New Hampshire Consumer Advocate has noted that this current order flies in the face of numerous orders and legislation subsequent to that 1998 decision and may be highly vulnerable on appeal.)
That phrasing sounds similar to the “let the market do it” rhetoric that was common in the utility deregulation era of the late 1990s. That was a concept we pretty thoroughly debunked in a study featuring extensive interviews with market participants , described in an ACEEE report in 2001 (Can We Just ""Rely on the Market"" to Provide Energy Efficiency?). Subsequent ACEEE research has followed the experience in numerous states in the past two decades and has abundantly demonstrated the success and importance of state policies requiring energy efficiency resource standards for utilities.
Another factor that state policymakers and regulators might want to consider as they weigh this issue is that New Hampshire has to import 100% of the natural gas, coal, and petroleum products that it consumes, which leads to a drain from the state of nearly $4 billion per year. Energy efficiency can help retain some of those dollars in the local economy.
The order is chock full of other destructive elements for utility energy efficiency. For instance, it eliminates the existing practice of providing performance incentives for utilities for energy efficiency achievements. More details about the order, including some procedural history and a lengthy list of specific elements of concern, can be found in a letter from the New Hampshire Consumer Advocate to his advisory board.
It would be a significant benefit to New Hampshire residents and businesses if regulators would rethink this policy reversal and get back on the track of increasing energy efficiency efforts in the state—which would help customers combat rising energy costs, boost the state’s economy, and reduce carbon emissions in the region.

Congress Needs to Build on Infrastructure Bill’s Efficiency Funding with Additional Transformative Investments;"Washington, DC—The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy released the following statement from Steven Nadel, its executive director, in response to the U.S. House of Representatives passing a major infrastructure bill on November 5 and sending it to President Biden for his signature:
“This bill will invest several billion dollars in measures to save energy, and that’s a major positive step. It increases funding for low-income home weatherization, public transit, small manufacturing plants, and industrial decarbonization demonstrations, among other programs. However, it also includes unbalanced highway funding that perpetuates an unsustainable transportation system.
“To reduce high energy bills and address the climate crisis, Congress needs to do much more. It needs to follow up with transformative investments in the upcoming budget bill.
“We have no time to waste. Today the climate is growing more extreme, and families are facing rising energy prices. The Build Back Better budget bill offers unprecedented opportunities to improve affordable housing, upgrade home heating, transform industry, boost affordable transportation options, and make other timely investments—all of which would reduce people’s expenses and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Congress needs to step up and pass this bill.”
Background:
ACEEE has previously outlined many of the efficiency investments in the infrastructure bill in more detail, and reviewed its transportation-related measures while calling for stronger measures in the budget bill.
The infrastructure bill includes (among other programs):
$3.5 billion in new funds for weatherizing homes of low-income households
More than $1 billion for building energy codes, new revolving loan funds supporting commercial building and home upgrades, public school and federal building upgrades, and worker training
$39 billion in additional public transportation funds; however, these funds are paired with much larger investments in roads and highways that sustain an energy-intensive transportation system
$7.5 billion primarily aimed to install more electric vehicle chargers and $2.5 billion for zero-emission and alternative fuel school buses
$150 million to boost industrial assessment centers that help small manufacturing plants identify possible efficiency improvements, and a new $400 million grant program to help plants implement them
$500 million for industrial demonstration projects and $50 million for smart manufacturing
The Build Back Better budget reconciliation bill still pending in Congress includes (among other programs):
$5.89 billion in rebates for homeowners who make whole-home efficiency upgrades, plus $360 million for training contractors, with at least 25% for homes of low- and moderate-income households
$6.25 billion in rebates for homeowners and multifamily building owners to electrify—such as with heat pumps—with $3.8 billion of this funding dedicated for low- and moderate-income households and tribal communities
$2 billion (with up to $4 billion in lending authority) for improving the energy and water efficiency—and climate resilience—of multifamily affordable housing
Updated and expanded tax incentives for efficient new and upgraded homes and commercial buildings—including much-improved incentives for constructing new homes that are zero energy ready and for deep energy retrofits of commercial buildings
$300 million to support the current model building codes and codes for zero-energy buildings
$4 billion in grants for states, municipalities, and other entities to invest in transportation infrastructure projects that reduce carbon emissions
New incentives for the purchase of electric trucks and buses, as well as $5 billion in grants and rebates, including $2 billion specifically for areas where air quality does not meet federal standards
$10 billion for transit projects supporting access to affordable housing and enhancing mobility for residents in disadvantaged communities
Major updates and expansion of tax credits for electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, vehicle chargers, and new credits for used electric vehicles and electric bicycles
A first-of-its-kind $4 billion investment toward decarbonizing the industrial sector via cost-sharing funds for deploying advanced industrial process technologies
Broader funds that could be used for efficiency, including $29 billion in greenhouse gas reduction funds for state and local governments and nonprofits, about $12 billion for rural electric co-ops and other rural grants and loans, $8 billion for energy communities and environment and climate justice block grants, $3.6 billion for loan guarantees, and more than $90 billion for public and assisted housing

Community-Led Strategies Can Help Advance Equitable Clean Energy Investments;"Growing up in the South Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, I experienced firsthand social, economic, and environmental injustices. One of the most polluted places in California, Watts suffers from cumulative environmental burdens. These environmental hazards are evident in the Alameda Corridor, a 20-mile-long freight line responsible for air pollution, and a Superfund site adjacent to the local public high school. The pollution is one reason the residents of Watts live 10 fewer years on average than those residing in nearby affluent neighborhoods. Just by living there, my life expectancy was likely reduced. 
My commitment to working at the intersection of social and environmental justice is personal; it stems from my years having to advocate for access to clean air, clean water, affordable energy, and the right to live in a neighborhood not plagued by environmental neglect. But my experiences are not unique—many people of color and low-income communities across the nation live in neighborhoods that face staggering environmental, health, and social challenges. 
In an ACEEE report and accompanying digital StoryMap released today, we identified six effective community-based clean energy strategies and case examples of community-based organizations (CBOs) working to advance equitable, local clean energy solutions for communities plagued by disinvestment and systemic injustices. These new resources offer recommendations for decision makers interested in engaging and supporting community-based clean energy efforts.  
Community-Focused Strategies in Action 
The new report analyzes 32 CBOs working to advance clean energy developments and assesses strategies they employ to support equitable clean energy development, bolster the local workforce, build community resilience, improve energy affordability, and spur economic prosperity. Here are six strategies these CBOs use to drive clean energy outcomes in local communities: 
Our resources dive into case studies of CBOs modeling one or more of these strategies. In our StoryMap, we present videos and stories from three CBOs and highlight resources for decision makers seeking to foster equity in clean energy in the communities they serve. 
The following are two examples of strategies CBOs may employ to develop effective programming and empower residents to become leaders, educators, and advocates in their communities.  
Deliver Clean Energy Services to Maximize Benefits to Local Communities 
CBOs can design and deliver local energy efficiency programs to reduce residents’ energy expenses and make their homes healthier. Independently or under hire by the local government, they can reach households that would otherwise struggle to access these resources due to high upfront costs. Programs that hire locally have the added benefit of providing residents well-paying jobs weatherizing homes in their community.
In West Buffalo, New York, People United for Sustainable Housing Buffalo (PUSH), a nonprofit organization, offers a community-based energy efficiency program called PUSH Green.
The program delivers energy efficiency services to residents and small businesses, nonprofits, and multifamily properties and bolsters the local workforce while reducing the dependency on fossil fuels. PUSH Green offers residents free or reduced-cost comprehensive home energy assessments, solar installations, and educational workshops on energy efficiency, weatherization, and solar energy. Since 2012, PUSH Green has provided services to more than 700 low- to moderate-income households and created 50 high-paying, high-quality jobs in the emerging green sector and construction industry.
Build Capacity in Communities for Locally Led Clean Energy Efforts 
Empowering residents to bring about change in their communities can strengthen a new base of community leaders and advocates. CBOs are well suited to provide support and training to residents and partner organizations to advocate for energy equity and develop campaigns to ensure that public funds for energy efficiency and renewable energy are spent equitably and benefit all residents.  
The Partnership for Southern Equity offers the Just Energy Academy,a seven-month energy equity leadership program that educates, trains, and empowers local community members to engage with stakeholders.
Participants gain skills and tools to advocate for energy equity, racial equity, climate justice, and energy policies that benefit their communities. The Just Energy Academy and similar community empowerment programs are crucial for strengthening and supporting local leaders.    
Achieving Equitable Clean Energy through Local Government-CBO Partnerships 
CBOs play a vital role in advancing equitable clean energy progress, and our report offers recommendations for local officials seeking to support them. Prioritizing accountability in collaborations between decision makers and CBOs can help address disparities in clean energy policy, program development, and evaluation processes while enabling the CBOs to define and drive clean energy initiatives.  
The involvement of community members and organizations in clean energy planning and decision-making processes can ensure that residents—and future generations—benefit from these services and programs.

Energy Upgrades in Texas Homes Could Avert Blackouts at Lower Cost than Proposed Gas Plants;"Washington, DC—Rather than build new power plants at high cost, Texas could avert future blackouts at a lower price by instead improving the energy efficiency of its homes and using technologies to shift electricity use away from times of peak demand, according to a report released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
The report arrives as Texas policymakers, regulators, and utilities seek to address electric reliability challenges in the wake of Winter Storm Uri. It shows that wide-scale efficiency and demand response investments through utility programs could provide the same degree of added reliability as proposed gas plants for at least 39% lower cost—not even accounting for the operations and maintenance costs of those plants.
Extreme temperatures can not only shut down some power generators but also cause electric demand to spike as residents crank up the heat or air-conditioning. Those spikes can be acute in Texas, where the most common type of home heating is inefficient electric furnaces and half of single-family houses have inadequate attic insulation, according to federal data.
“Electric demand is always going to go up when there’s hot or cold weather, but it’s a manageable problem if you have efficient houses,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of ACEEE and lead author of the report. “Wasting electricity in Texas when power demand is peaking just doesn't make sense. Home efficiency upgrades and technology that shifts when electricity is used simply costs less than building new plants, and we have the numbers to prove it.”
ACEEE modeled the potential impact of Texas’s electric utilities expanding their programs (and creating new programs) that incentivize homeowners to upgrade from electric furnaces to efficient heat pumps when existing systems need to be replaced, improve attic insulation and duct sealing, switch to smart thermostats, and install heat pump water heaters. ACEEE also considered three potential demand response programs, in which electric customers are provided an incentive to allow their utility to shift when their central air conditioners, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers are used away from times of the highest stress on the power system.
The 7 programs, deployed aggressively under Public Utility Commission direction over 5 years (beginning in 2023), could offset about 7,650 MW of summer peak load and 11,400 MW of winter peak load, ACEEE found. This approximately equals the electricity that would be generated under 2 separate private proposals this year to build 10 or 11 new gas power plants that would be used at peak times.
While the gas plants would cost $8 billion, the efficiency and demand response measures would have a 5-year total programmatic cost of about $4.9 billion, or 39% less. They would also fully avoid the power plants’ additional costs for fuel, maintenance, and transmission infrastructure.
And while new power plants might only be put to use during peak power demand events, efficiency programs would reduce energy bills for many Texans year-round. Some of the modeled programs would also make homes healthier and safer for residents.
The ACEEE report focuses on single-family homes and multifamily buildings because during recent summer and winter times of peak electric demand, the residential sector accounted for about half of recent temperature-sensitive peak loads. Other policies not examined in the report could unlock additional demand reductions through cost-effective efficiency and demand response in the commercial and industrial sectors.

What’s the Latest and Greatest in Energy Efficiency? EER Speakers Offer U.S. Snapshot;"Across the United States, utilities, cities, and states are taking action to address climate change and economic challenges with new and expanded energy efficiency policies and programs that aim to advance equity, build the clean energy workforce of the future, and ensure a clean, reliable grid.
Please join us next week for discussion of the latest and greatest developments in energy efficiency at the virtual National Conference on Energy Efficiency as a Resource (EER). This 11th biennial event is the premier conference on policies and programs to reduce customers' energy waste and help utilities meet customers’ energy needs. 
REGISTER for EER
The conference will feature keynote addresses by Senator Tina Smith (D-MN) on federal policy and the Department of Energy’s Shalanda Baker on energy equity. Aside from networking opportunities, it will also include more than 20 interactive sessions, plenaries on state climate goals and scaling energy efficiency, and 4 half-day workshops that explore equity-focused metrics, a resilient and inclusive workforce, grid-interactive efficient buildings, and health in residential program design.
For the popular regional roundup, I will moderate a conversation with seven energy efficiency (EE) leaders representing all parts of the United States. To give you a preview, I asked them to highlight some of the most exciting trends in their regions. Here are excerpts:
California: Serj Berelson, director of policy and strategy at the California Efficiency and Demand Management Council
Energy efficiency in California has had a typical busy year in 2021! First, the California Public Utilities Commission has adopted a new filing process, cost-effectiveness threshold, and—in keeping with this month's most important holiday—a mysterious new metric for EE portfolios! Second, grid reliability has been an issue of the highest importance in California over the past year due to wildfires, droughts, and other effects of climate change. This has led to a new proceeding, an emergency proclamation from the governor, and new potential opportunities for EE to meet grid needs. You'll have to attend to learn more about these developments in the state ranked #1 in ACEEE's State Scorecard!
South Central: Kelly Herbert, acting executive director, South-Central Partnership for Energy Efficiency as a Resource
One of our biggest focuses right now is grid resilience and reliability. While in the past much of Texas's peak loads have occurred in the summer heat, with more extreme weather conditions and storms occurring, we will begin to also witness these peak loads, and potential blackouts, in winter months. An increased focus on and implementation of energy efficiency measures can ease the demand on ERCOT (the Electric Reliability Council of Texas) during a winter emergency or more-predictable summer needs. We know energy efficiency and permanent load shifting (investments to permanently reduce total demand or reshape the demand profile), as well as demand response, are required to reduce the systemic inefficiencies that are driving peak load and high costs in our state.
The future of the Texas grid will rely on energy diversity through advanced technologies to ensure a system that is more reliable, efficient, and affordable for customers. But it is also likely that without a market of its own—because of the millions of individual actions required to obtain efficiency at scale—we are unlikely to approach an optimum level of efficiency investment as a society. We are working with other organizations at the Public Utility Commission of Texas to assist in the market redesign to ensure a more reliable grid this winter!
Southwest: Elise Jones, executive director of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project (SWEEP)
One of the “latest and greatest” contributions to energy efficiency in the Southwest comes from Colorado’s 2021 state legislature, which adopted a groundbreaking four-bill clean buildings package that provides a model for slashing carbon emissions from the building sector while producing good jobs and better indoor air quality in the process. An overarching “clean heat” bill sets climate pollution reduction targets for gas utilities and directs them to craft plans to meet these through strategies like efficiency and electrification.
The other three measures, conceived and promoted by SWEEP, provide pathways for meeting these goals. A building electrification measure has electric utilities develop strategies to help their customers swap out gas-powered furnaces, water heaters, and stoves for electric ones. Another measure improves the efficiency programs of gas utilities, and the third bill directs large commercial building owners to benchmark their buildings’ energy performance and then requires low performers to improve their efficiency over time.
Midwest: Stacey Paradis, executive director of the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance
I’m inspired by the passion and commitment for equity and to ensure efficiency comes to underserved populations. In the Midwest, all members of the EE community (utilities, government, contractors, implementers, advocates) are prioritizing developing and running programs to bring the economic and environmental benefits of efficiency to new people and new communities. Additionally, there is a recognition and a goal to diversify and expand the EE workforce so that it is representative of all the communities across our states.
In a number of states in the Midwest, through recent legislation or executive action, energy efficiency is finally being recognized and appreciated as a key component of the clean energy future. There are supporting not only utility programs, but also efficiency programs focused on new and existing buildings. We all recognize the economic, environmental, and societal impact of our industry, but more so governors, legislators, and regulators are also recognizing it.
Northeast: Arah Schuur, executive director, Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnership (NEEP)
A flurry of legislative and executive action in recent years means that (nearly) every state in NEEP’s region now has binding emissions reduction targets. In response, cities and states across the region have advanced policies, such as building benchmarking and performance standards, that recognize the fundamental importance of building energy consumption in meeting emissions targets. The region continued to invest in robust energy efficiency programs and to evolve these programs to include new tactics, including demand management and beneficial electrification, recognizing that energy efficiency continues to be the least-cost means to meet climate and energy goals.
At the same time, the region is beginning to make progress in acknowledging and addressing the unequal distribution of energy efficiency benefits. This dialogue has intensified as the non-energy benefits of energy efficiency—from occupant health to job creation—are increasingly counted and recognized, and as community-led climate action planning has highlighted the need for equitable decarbonization. Policy makers and energy efficiency councils have responded, forming equity advisory groups, incorporating equity targets and incentives into program design, and passing new laws that require assessing impacts of energy and climate decisions with an environmental justice lens.
Southeast: Aimee Skrzekut, president of the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance
Recently there has been a shift among utilities, regulators, and decision makers in the Southeast toward recognizing the need for climate change mitigation and adoption strategies that highlight the benefits of energy efficiency and prioritize equitable solutions. Like many places across the country, cities and states in the Southeast are working to improve the air quality and efficiency of schools and homes and setting electric transportation goals. In addition to this progress, the Southeast is taking significant leaps forward in adopting building codes, transforming the energy workforce, and adapting to the impacts of climate change. Regulators are adopting more robust building energy code standards and processes that promote healthier, more resilient homes, schools, and workplaces.
In response to stronger storms driven by climate change, public service commissions are reviewing grid resiliency and investing in upgrades. The movement toward an energy-efficient Southeast depends on private and public investment in a more diverse workforce. Workforce development at technical colleges, nonprofits, and historically black colleges or HBCUs will provide a broader and more diverse candidate pool and ultimately a workforce that can support the energy needs of all communities.
Northwest: Susan Stratton, executive director of the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA)
Heat pump technology has been at the forefront of NEEA’s accomplishments, with a solid 10% of new electric water heaters capturing this technology. Natural gas heat pump technology is on the way as well. To enhance the Northwest’s reach with market transformation, NEEA is working with Midwest states and other interested parties to share our market transformation knowledge base so that we can better collaborate for greater influence with manufacturers, distributors, and retailers for more-efficient products. 
ENERGY STAR® is one example of such a broad market transformation success. Other national collaborations like PAWS (the Partnership for Advanced Window Solutions) and the AWHI (Advanced Water Heater Initiative) can also enhance the leverage of our local efforts. Further, we know that the future value of energy efficiency lies in connected buildings that can contribute capacity to the grid. There’s lots of work to do!

ACEEE and 800+ Groups Celebrate Energy Efficiency Day;"Statement by Steven Nadel, ACEEE executive director:
Happy Energy Efficiency Day! Nearly 900 local governments, universities, organizations, corporations, and utilities are participating in #EEDay2021 today—and we hope you will join us. Using energy more efficiently is the heart of a clean energy future: It saves Americans billions of dollars each year on utility bills, supports more than 2 million jobs, and contributes to healthier and more comfortable homes.
This year, increasingly frequent extreme weather events—from drought and fires to record-breaking flooding—have underscored the urgency of addressing climate change. Reducing energy waste is a crucial tool. Bold efficiency measures can slash U.S. energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by about 50% by 2050, getting us halfway to our national climate goals.
As Congress considers historic efficiency investments that could boost the economic recovery, cities, counties, and states across the nation are touting their energy-saving efforts. More than 30 cities, counties, states, and universities have issued official proclamations declaring Wednesday, October 6 as Energy Efficiency Day—including Michigan, Mississippi, and Columbus, Ohio.
We can all do more to save energy in our everyday lives; even small actions such as cleaning an air conditioner filter or replacing incandescent light bulbs with LEDs can make an impact. Start thinking about how you can incorporate efficiency into your life and join us as we celebrate this sixth annual event.

Report: States’ Climate Efforts Will Be More Costly, Less Equitable without Stronger Efficiency Steps;"Washington, DC—A slew of states with robust climate goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions risk incurring higher costs for households and businesses and seeing less-equitable outcomes because they have limited plans for using energy more efficiently, a report today warns. Most of their signature state climate policies, such as clean electricity standards and emissions reductions goals, have not articulated the important role of energy efficiency in plans to decarbonize state electric grids and economies, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) finds.
Without clear direction, state agencies and utility regulators may not prioritize energy-saving efforts, missing a key opportunity to help ensure clean energy and climate targets are achieved—and done so equitably and at lower cost. Policymakers could, for instance, adopt rules that enable utilities to provide customers incentives for buying electric heat pumps, set building energy performance standards that spur energy-efficient retrofits, or invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure coupled with comprehensive transportation planning efforts.
“Transitioning away from electricity sources that produce greenhouse gases is a big undertaking, and reducing energy waste is one of the most important tools. If your state doesn’t have a pretty clear plan for how to improve efficiency, it’s on an uncertain and potentially costly path toward decarbonization,” said Weston Berg, senior researcher for state policy at ACEEE and lead author of the report. “It doesn’t make sense for any state to go after a big transformation of its energy system with one hand tied behind its back. We don’t want to look back in a decade or two and see that these states left some of the best tools on the table.”
ACEEE’s review of the 17 U.S. states and territories with laws requiring a transition to 100% clean electricity found that only Virginia’s and Washington State’s include specific efficiency targets. And of the 24 states (and the District of Columbia) with greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, 8 make no mention of energy efficiency, while 15 mention it in an undefined way. Only New York’s and the District of Columbia’s emissions targets encompass specific energy consumption reduction goals.
Most of these states have a separate goal for reducing energy use through utility programs that incentivize customers to make energy-saving improvements; many have undertaken efficiency efforts on other policy fronts, such as buildings and transportation. But the report argues that vague or missing efficiency commitments in greenhouse gas reduction goals or clean electricity standards indicate the states have not prioritized the needed ramp-up of efficiency efforts and risk addressing energy waste in piecemeal fashion or as an afterthought.
Several studies show that improving energy efficiency is a key tool for decarbonization. The International Energy Agency’s global roadmap to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, for instance, calls for efficiency improvements averaging 4% per year through 2030, about 3 times the average over the last 2 decades.
The ACEEE report argues that vastly expanded energy efficiency efforts—driven by state goals, direction, and mandates—would:
·       Reduce the costs of meeting clean electricity standards by greatly reducing the amount and cost of new renewable energy needed. Combined with demand response measures that shift electric loads to times when renewable energy is abundant, efficiency measures can reduce the challenge of peaks in electric demand and the amount of needed renewables. Efficiency improvements will also reduce the vast land area that will be needed for future solar and wind power facilities.
·       Aid the electrification of home equipment and transportation. The large-scale electrification of buildings, transportation, and industry will require not only additional energy generation but also new transmission and distribution investments. Efficiency measures will be critical for mitigating these needs and thus easing the costs of electrification. Measures like weatherization are also crucial for maintaining safe home temperatures in increasingly frequent extreme weather events and associated power outages.
·       Make the transition to a decarbonized economy more equitable. Low-income, Black, Hispanic, and Native American households spend a larger share of their income on energy expenses than the average household. Targeted efficiency improvements—particularly for households that are struggling the most—can ensure program benefits extend to all households and immediately and directly reduce energy waste and inequities. Investments in public transit and electric vehicle charging in low-income communities could help ensure clean transportation is available for everyone.
The report highlights examples from states that have demonstrated growing efforts to expand energy efficiency programs in support of state climate plans and, in certain cases, fully align them as part of an integrated statewide strategy. In Minnesota, a new law allows utility efficiency programs to offer customers incentives to switch from fossil fuel equipment to electrified equipment like heat pumps; utility regulators in New York have updated rules for efficiency programs to cut more greenhouse gas emissions; and Virginia lawmakers passed a bill last year setting energy-saving targets for utilities alongside a 100% clean electricity target. Other states passing important energy legislation this year aligning efficiency with climate goals have included Colorado, Illinois, and Massachusetts.
The report calls on states to harmonize and coordinate efficiency goals with clean electricity standards and greenhouse gas emissions targets, and in turn set a series of complementary policies to improve energy efficiency.
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), a nonprofit research organization, develops policies to reduce energy waste and combat climate change. Its independent analysis advances investments, programs, and behaviors that use energy more effectively and help build an equitable clean energy future.

"Get Ready for Energy Efficiency Day; ACEEE Staff Share Their Ideas";"Next Wednesday, October 6, is Energy Efficiency Day. This annual nationwide campaign recognizes and celebrates the multiple benefits of energy efficiency — the least expensive, fastest way to meet our energy needs, reduce consumer bills, and cut pollution.
Energy efficiency is also an economic engine, directly employing more Americans (at least two million) than any other single energy sector. As we push to end the COVID-19 pandemic and revive the economy by putting millions of people back to work, the efficiency sector offers opportunities for good local jobs.
This year, more than 800 local governments, universities, organizations, corporations, and utilities are participating in #EEDay2021. We invite you to join these groups and let others know about the 6th annual Energy Efficiency Day, organized by a network of environmental and energy efficiency organizations, including ACEEE. You can help spread the word by emailing your colleagues and friends or posting on social media.
To spur ideas for your efficiency journey, we reached out to ACEEE staff to see how they have incorporated energy efficiency into their lives.
Corinne Abbott, Director of Development
Corinne, a homeowner in Virginia, recently replaced many of her drafty, warped, wood-framed, double-hung windows with vinyl ENERGY STAR® windows. These windows have two panes of glass with a layer of inert gas, in this case argon, between them. They help minimize heat transfer between indoors and the outside, so the HVAC system won’t need to work as hard. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, installing such windows throughout a home can save $101-$583 per year when replacing single-pane windows, or $27-$197 per year when replacing double-pane windows.
Hannah Tsimmerman, Development Associate
Hannah and her spouse recently bought a home in Cortland County, New York and replaced some very dated chandeliers with dimmable light fixtures designed to use LED bulbs. They like how the new lights have warm and cool settings, don’t add visual clutter, and save them money on their rural electric bills. These savings can be substantial. The U.S. Energy Information Administration says lighting accounts for about 4% of an average home's electricity use, and using LEDs can save the average home about $40 in energy costs per year.

Mariel is committing to buying more of her food, especially produce, locally. As Mariel puts it, “I am fortunate to live in an area with a lot of farm stands. I can get fresher veggies than what I would buy at the supermarket, which has to travel 3,000+ truck miles from California to reach the East Coast.”

Ben reminds us that taking individual action can also mean advocating for energy-efficient transportation and buildings. He likes to ask his local elected officials in Washington, DC, to champion bus and bike lanes and to support efforts to reduce energy use in buildings. “If you haven’t picked up the phone or written that email to say what you want them to do, you’re sitting it out,” he says. “Don’t be shy!”
Please share your own energy efficiency success stories with us on social media on October 6. We look forward to celebrating Energy Efficiency Day with you.

Scaling Energy Efficiency Is the ‘Elephant in the Room’: EER Speakers Discuss Its Urgency;"Extreme weather events, exacerbated by rising temperatures, as well as mounting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have underscored the urgency of the climate challenge and the vital need for energy efficiency. We know that efficiency can halve emissions by 2050 and get the United States halfway to its climate goals. We also know that the actions utilities take to meet climate commitments are critical to those efforts. But how do we ensure progress? And can we achieve it equitably and quickly?
ACEEE takes on this issue next month at its 11th biennial National Conference on Energy Efficiency as a Resource (EER), the premier conference on policies and programs to reduce customers' energy waste and help utilities meet customers’ energy needs. This two-week virtual event will include more than 20 interactive sessions, networking breaks, four half-day workshops, plenaries, and a lightning round session.

“We’re closing the conference with a bang,” says Gene Rodrigues, vice president of market development at ICF and moderator of the last plenary—Getting Energy Efficiency to Scale: Breakthroughs and Breakouts. He says speakers will share “no-holds-barred perspectives” on moving beyond status-quo thinking about efficiency policies and programs. “There will be no ‘admiring the problem’ allowed during this closing plenary,” he says. “Come to participate in a fast-paced and fiery exploration of what must be done to unleash the full potential of energy efficiency.”
To get a sneak peak, we asked a few questions of the panel’s four speakers: Andy Frank, founder and president of Sealed; Lisa Wood, vice president of customer solutions at the Edison Electric Institute; Chris Duffrin, president of the Center for Energy and Environment; and Bill LeBlanc, chief instigation agent at E Source. Here are excerpts of our conversation:
  Why focus on the need to scale up energy efficiency (EE) to meet our climate goals?
Andy: I think scaling energy efficiency (and the challenges thereof) is the elephant in the room. At our current pace, it will take more than 500 years to retrofit every home in America. But we don't have 50 years, much less 500 to make this happen. So if we're not talking about solutions that scale, we're not serious about addressing our climate challenges. 
Chris: We are not going to be able to solve the climate crisis simply by constructing a 100% clean grid and electrifying everything. There’s a lot to do on the supply side, but if we are going to meet the challenge, we have to make energy loads more efficient, responsive, and optimized. I’m reminded of the old Regulatory Assistance Project line: “Efficiency is the answer. Now what’s the question?” We have to get it in gear and start scaling—like now. 
Lisa: Energy efficiency provides key benefits in achieving carbon reductions. A cleaner energy future means dramatically reducing carbon emissions, and EE is a flexible part of the solution to this problem.
What are the largest barriers to scaling energy efficiency rapidly and equitably?
Bill: The implementation side of the efficiency industry has been built in a piecemeal fashion. Utilities and some government agencies, mostly local, all have their own unique approaches to solutions, incentive design, and marketing/implementation methods. This means it's tough to get economies of scale, which are seen in other industries that are more consolidated. HVAC, lighting, and building contractors also are very localized. So it's tough to get everyone rowing in the same direction. The biggest equity barrier continues to be the landlord-tenant gap. 
Andy: There are many barriers to scaling energy efficiency, but fundamentally the industry focuses on the wrong value propositions. Historically, energy efficiency has been sold as a vegetable—it is good for you and prudent to save money on your energy bill. But people don't like vegetables :). The good news is that energy efficiency actually means a healthier, more comfortable quality of life. In other words, to scale, energy efficiency needs to be sold as having your cake (and eating it too). 
How can these barriers be overcome most effectively?
Bill: When we conducted a two-day design workshop in late 2019 with some of the smartest EE people in the country, we addressed this very question. The top answer that resulted was pushing more midstream and upstream programs. Right behind that recommendation was to create standardized approaches to EE implementation so that scale can be reached and costs can drop. The third answer was to push for more building code efficiency statutes (mostly state and local). These are all tough to accomplish but would each contribute greatly to overcoming barriers to EE adoption. 
Chris: Significant federal investments like we see in the U.S. House reconciliation bill proposal for both efficiency and electrification sure would help. Perhaps more important than the dollar amounts in the bill is the 10-year commitment the House proposes for these investments. To scale up a larger, more diverse energy efficiency workforce, we also need long-term commitments and funds for worker training. Strong state policy remains critical, but we need a significant federal policy response.
Which sector of the economy is ripest for scaling efficiency and why?
Bill: Tough question. It may not be as much about the sector as it is finding the right households and businesses that are most ripe for EE from a readiness and potential savings perspective. We need to use our rich data sets and data science to reach the right customers at the right time with the right messages. My second answer is that the sector with the biggest efficiency potential is transportation. Electric vehicles are so much more efficient than ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles, and can use carbon-free energy more readily, as well as providing grid advantages. 
Chris: The correct answer is probably transportation, because of recent technological advances and just how behind we are in the United States in this area. But I think there is a case for building-shell efficiency, particularly in the residential and multifamily sector. We have been field testing cold-climate heat pumps for the past seven years and are impressed by the advances in this technology, but in order to maximize their potential for heating electrification, we are going to have to dramatically improve the efficiency of our building stock, particularly in our colder regions. Air sealing and insulation are the enabling technologies for electrification in the North.
Which breakthrough or breakout in particular holds great promise?
Andy: I think air source heat pumps are still an unappreciated energy efficiency technology. For me, they are the closest thing to magic that we have in energy efficiency. And the manufacturers have made tremendous gains over the last 10 years to ensure that heat pumps can work in even the coldest climates. At Sealed, we have seen amazing response to air source heat pumps—people just love them and not always for the reasons you think. 
Lisa: Once we start to measure electric utility energy efficiency programs in terms of carbon reductions (in addition to kWh savings, which is happening in California), heads will turn. This will take energy efficiency out of its silo and help scale it to levels we haven’t seen before.
Are you optimistic that we can scale efficiency quickly and massively enough to address the climate crisis?
Lisa: Corporate customers today are moving beyond simple renewable energy solutions to achieve carbon reductions… As “suppliers” start to shape solutions for corporate customers, energy efficiency and demand response will be a part of these solutions, because they allow customers to better time their energy use (as does storage, but EE is so much cheaper). I see this as the pathway to scaling EE—it becomes part of the carbon reduction pie and is very, very cost-effective.
Andy: I'm very confident that we can scale efficiency as long as we are bold and work our way back from what is required to address the climate crisis. I'm a history nerd and am always inspired by the way in which successive generations have addressed problems that seemed both existential and unsolvable at the time. Ultimately, we need bold policy solutions through performance standards and other mechanisms, but industry needs to do its part by demonstrating how energy efficiency solutions can not only scale but actually lead to better quality of life. Think Tesla not Volt.

Efficiency Plans Before Congress Would Save Money, Create Jobs, Protect the Climate;"As Congress scrambles to develop a bill to invest trillions of dollars in economic recovery, it seeks to create jobs, slash climate-warming emissions, and help people struggling to pay their bills. Transformative energy efficiency investments would deliver major progress on all three.
In a new analysis, we look at almost $350 billion of investments to save energy in every sector of the economy, largely proposals currently before Congress as it develops a “reconciliation” bill. We find that these investments could achieve over the lifetime of the investments and savings:
3.2 million added jobs (job years)
4.5 billion tons of reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, equivalent to total U.S. emissions for 11 months
$282 billion in energy bill savings and other consumer benefits (e.g., manufacturing cost, health, and comfort benefits) above the investment
The new analysis does not include savings from expanding utility efficiency programs. However, in a recent fact sheet we present an analysis that found that spurring utilities through a combination of payments and fees to expand assistance for households and businesses to undertake energy-saving measures could cut another 2.4 billion tons of emissions, with a federal cost of just $4-10 billion.
$350 billion is a big investment, far more than what the government spends now on efficiency, but over 10 years, it’s less than private spending on efficiency (and less than what supporters are seeking in the bill for renewable energy). We also found that a smaller $126 billion package could achieve more than half the impacts.
How do we reap these benefits? These results combine our analyses of 21 potential investments across eight areas, as shown in the figure below.
  These analyses are revised (some significantly) from a fact sheet we published in June, as proposals have been refined and new ideas brought forward.
Here are a few of the key possibilities pending before Congress; a couple other items are in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that also is pending.
Industrial decarbonization: The greatest carbon savings per federal dollar, by far, would be for measures to reduce emissions and reduce costs in manufacturing plants, yet these proposals have received relatively little attention to date. For example, the First Three proposal would provide federal cost-sharing for the first three full-scale applications of new transformative industrial technologies that promise massive reductions in emissions, such as direct reduction of iron with “green” hydrogen. These incentives would be especially effective in pushing a transition to a clean industrial sector, with estimated savings of one billion tons of CO2. Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL) recently introduced a bill to authorize such a program.
Home retrofits and electrification: A second key area is energy efficiency retrofits of homes—especially for low- and moderate-income households that rent apartments and that live in single-family houses—and installation of efficient heat pumps and heat pump water heaters. Although these measures have relatively modest carbon and energy savings per dollar invested, their equity and affordability benefits are large. They are essential to improve health and reduce costs for many people who are struggling to pay bills or living in poor conditions. And they are essential to help spur the market toward retrofits needed to reduce emissions from the more than 100 million existing homes that will still be around in 2050.
An example is the GREAHT proposal to fund efficiency and heat pump upgrades, as well as solar panels, health and safety improvements, and resilience measures in buildings with nearly 9 million subsidized and naturally occurring affordable apartment units. GREAHT would cut 200 tons of CO2 emissions while providing $24 billion in energy savings and more in other benefits.
Electric trucks and buses: Our recent post makes clear that we need new investments in our transportation system that serve both travelers and the climate. One key step is a tax credit for the purchase of new electric trucks and other commercial vehicles, which are far behind electric cars in development and availability. A 30% tax credit, as proposed in the Senate Finance Committee’s Clean Energy for America Act and Rep. Don Beyer’s (D-VA) Green VAN Act, would help shift the freight sector to non-polluting vehicles. It could result in half a million more electric trucks and save 12 billion gallons of diesel fuel.
Utility efficiency programs: A key Biden administration goal for the reconciliation bill is to use a combination of tax credits, payments, and fees to push the electric sector to 80% clean sources by 2030. To make that transition reliable, cost-effective, and equitable, we believe reducing and managing demand are as important as developing new sources. To that end, in addition to the investments described in this white paper, we’ve called for the bill to include provisions to spur utilities to meet a growing portion of energy needs through efficiency programs that help their customers save energy and costs. Boosting utilities’ efficiency work will make it easier to meet remaining energy needs with clean power, help incorporate more electric equipment and more variable renewable power, and reduce costs for electric customers.
With these energy efficiency investments, we can take a big step forward on the way to an economy that benefits all consumers, workers, and our climate.

Upcoming Budget Bill Needs to Invest in Sustainable Transportation;"The infrastructure bill recently passed by the Senate was hailed as a bipartisan success on many fronts, but it missed a crucial opportunity to equitably reorient transportation funds toward addressing climate change. While the package took small steps by funding some electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure programs and sending more dollars to strained public transit systems, the bill still uses massive spending to perpetuate the unsustainable transport system in the United States today.
The transportation sector is the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the United States and is a critical economic driver, connecting people to jobs and services. With changes to the infrastructure bill unlikely, Congress will need to use its budget reconciliation bill to make some headway toward a low-carbon transportation system.
What does the infrastructure bill include on low carbon transportation?
The infrastructure bill largely incorporates provisions from the Senate’s Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act of 2021, while leaving a number of key climate-centered provisions from the House of Representatives’ INVEST in America Act on the cutting room floor. Congress had an opportunity to resolve the major differences between these bills to ensure that future investments reduce—rather than exacerbate—transportation’s climate impacts and inequities, but the infrastructure bill skipped that process.
The infrastructure bill includes the following provisions:
Up to $12.5 billion for electric vehicle programs – The infrastructure bill ostensibly includes $7.5 billion to deploy a national network of publicly accessible EV chargers as well as $5 billion for the acquisition of clean school buses. However, a closer look at the details shows that this money isn’t entirely dedicated to electric vehicles and EV charging infrastructure; some of it can instead be used to purchase low-emissions diesel buses, as well as to fund the installation of propane and natural gas fueling facilities. These technologies don’t have the same greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction potential as electric vehicles.
$39 billion in additional public transit funding – Public transit agencies have seen a staggering drop in ridership and fare-based revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public transit serves as the backbone of major urban centers, is the single cleanest and most efficient way to move people en masse, and is disproportionately used by low-income communities and households of color. While the additional $39 billion is a good first step toward addressing existing capital-related needs, transit agencies need more than one-off injections of funds. They need consistent federal funding to ensure that they can meet future clean mobility needs—particularly for marginalized communities— while also addressing the $90 billion project backlog.
$6.4 billion for state projects to reduce carbon emissions from transportation – The bipartisan bill funds a program that awards grants to state projects that reduce transportation GHG emissions and encourages states to create a carbon reduction strategy. There are, however, no requirements for tracking the impact of these projects on GHGs nor any repercussions for not meeting achieved goals.
$6.5 million for multimodal freight projects – A new authorization for Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight Projects would increase funding available to expand the use of lower-emissions freight modes such as rail and short-sea shipping between coastline ports. The bill also supports freight system efficiency by requiring environmental concerns, decarbonization, community impacts, and e-commerce to be addressed in the national freight strategic plan; establishing a multimodal freight infrastructure and policy office; and reauthorizing the national freight research program.
What do we need to see in the budget reconciliation package and in future legislation?
There will be a new opportunity for the coming budget reconciliation bill to partially fill critical gaps in climate-forward transportation investments left wide open by the infrastructure bill. The bill could use tax credits and grant programs to support an equitable, low-carbon transportation system—though even that will only be the starting point to adequately address transportation emissions. Here are several top priorities Congress needs to include this month and in future legislation:
Incentives for medium- and heavy-duty EVs – On EVs, it’s critical that Congress create a purchase incentive for medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles (passenger EVs have long been eligible for a federal tax credit). EV trucks can cost up to twice as much as their functionally comparable diesel counterparts, making purchase incentives critical for spurring electrification in the heavy-duty sector. The Senate’s Clean Energy for America Act and Representative Beyer’s (D-VA) Green Vehicle Adoption Nationwide Act both call for a tax incentive that would cover 30% of the upfront cost of purchasing an electric truck or bus. This is a necessary step given that the infrastructure bill effectively raided the pot of money available for EV bus purchases by loosening qualifying requirements and allocating fewer dollars than expected.
Sustained funding for public transit – Congress will also need to allocate a more sustainable stream of money to public transit operations and maintenance. Historically, federal transportation funding has favored highway construction and maintenance. While up to 20% of Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenues are nominally dedicated to transit expenditures, between 2010 and 2019, an average of just 12.8% of the HTF was spent on public transportation. The additional $39 billion allocated through the infrastructure bill is a solid first step, but the reconciliation bill could offer an opportunity to create sustained increases in revenues directed toward public transit in line with the 50/50 split (public transit/highways) that many advocates are calling for.
GHG tracking in transportation funding – Finally, the reconciliation bill presents an opportunity to fund climate-focused transportation infrastructure in ways not addressed by the $6.4 billion in the bipartisan bill and to assign specific GHG- and equity-based tracking and impact requirements for that money. Provisions in the INVEST in America bill lend themselves as a good template. That bill’s $8.4 billion allocation for climate programs is accompanied by requirements for states to incorporate GHG emissions reduction and improvement of mobility access into their transportation planning. And it would direct the U.S. Department of Transportation, in collaboration with the EPA, to establish performance measures that will help states evaluate the GHG emissions and mobility access impacts of their transportation systems.
Attaching “teeth” to a pot of climate-focused investments will help reduce the GHG impact and improve the equity of the transportation system. The bottom line, however, is that the infrastructure bill’s massive new highway spending, untethered from climate and equity priorities, is not only a missed opportunity but a backward step. The reconciliation bill cannot fix all of this, but it should be used to the fullest extent possible to support low-carbon, equitable transportation.

Congress Can Slash Emissions by Supporting New Low-Carbon Industrial Technologies;"As Congress prepares its budget reconciliation package, one of the most effective ways it can reduce the large greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the industrial sector is by supporting commercialization of transformative industrial technologies.
The federal government has funded research, development, and demonstration projects for some of the critical technologies. However, these projects do not frequently reach commercial-scale deployment because potential investors often consider initial deployments, which can cost $1 billion or more, too high risk. Federal co-funding could address this challenge, accelerating adoption of these technologies.
An ACEEE policy brief released today proposes federal co-funding for the first three installations at production scale of new technologies that decarbonize industrial processes. Legislation to establish a program along these lines was introduced Friday by Rep. Kathy Castor, the chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.
We rallied environmental, industry, and labor stakeholders this week to call on Congress to include this proposal and other industrial decarbonization investments in the budget reconciliation bill this fall.
Under our plan, factory owners, technology providers, and other partners would work together to submit proposals for cost-sharing of the first, second, or third applications of new transformative industrial technologies. The Department of Energy would then select the proposals that would best maximize long-term GHG reductions for co-funding. The maximum grant would be 60% of the total cost for the first application of a new technology, 45% for the second application, and 30% for the third.
A review of large demonstration projects worldwide found that the average public share of costs was 64%, so this program, with a 30%–60% public share, will be less generous than the global average.
A recent ACEEE analysis found that this proposal, which we call “First Three,” could reduce U.S. GHG emissions by more than one billion metric tons over several decades, by far the largest reduction among policy proposals we examined. This emissions reduction is equivalent to the current combined annual emissions of California and Texas.
The new ACEEE brief also provides examples of transformative technologies poised for adoption that this new program could support. Examples include low-GHG hydrogen production, GHG reductions in virgin iron and aluminum production, and process changes to reduce GHG emissions in Portland cement production.
Congress is now working on a budget reconciliation bill that will include multiyear funding for a variety of programs to dramatically reduce U.S. emissions. The proposed First Three program would be one of the most cost-effective investments (in terms of terms of emissions reduction per federal dollar), that Congress can make while also putting the United States on the path to long-term industrial decarbonization.

Biden Wants to Retrofit Affordable Housing. Energy Efficiency Should Be a Key Part.;"As Congress works on trillions of dollars in investments this month to help people recover from the pandemic and to transition to a clean energy economy, it should not overlook a critical but often neglected area: affordable rental housing.
We’re talking in particular about multifamily buildings that tend to be older and less energy efficient, often burdening residents with high utility bills. By investing in energy-saving upgrades for affordable rentals, Congress and the Biden administration can reduce energy bills and climate-warming emissions, create jobs, and improve quality of life for millions of the Americans who need it most.
We should seize this opportunity to make the pandemic recovery more equitable by funding the GREAHT (Green, Resilient, Efficient, and Affordable Homes for Tenants) proposal as part of the upcoming reconciliation bill. This plan, developed by ACEEE and the National Housing Trust (NHT), calls for up to $75 billion in federal investment over 10 years to fund energy efficiency upgrades as well as health and safety improvements, electrification, solar power, and better resilience in low and moderate-income multifamily housing. The current proposal includes two components: (1) grants through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to retrofit HUD-assisted housing and (2) funding to Community Development Financial Institutions to help market rate affordable housing make upgrades while retaining affordability.
The proposal aligns with President Biden’s American Jobs Plan, which seeks to “[m]ake housing more energy efficient and resilient for millions of families… through a historic investment in building upgrades.” And it was included in major housing infrastructure legislation introduced by House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters last month.
A recent ACEEE analysis estimates that with full funding GREAHT could avoid carbon emissions equivalent to 40 million cars being driven for a year and create tens of thousands of jobs for several years.
The proposal could retrofit up to 8 million affordable housing units by giving landlords grants and loans to improve their buildings’ energy efficiency, water efficiency, and resilience. It would include an array of improvements that make homes healthier and more comfortable. The investments could include measures such as insulation, better windows, updated appliances, and reflective roofing. A switch to electric heat pumps and heat pump water heaters would get added funding. Also eligible: mold mitigation, moisture control, floodproofing, solar panels and battery storage.
Improving quality of life for those who need it most
The GREAHT proposal would support households that may not have the money or authority to retrofit or renovate their own homes. It provides government funding to building owners who might not otherwise make the efficiency improvements needed to improve tenant safety and comfort. It will make housing more affordable for residents by lowering energy bills.
By contrast, many existing programs aimed at increasing building efficiency give homeowners tax rebates or other incentives that encourage them to invest some of their own money in efficiency upgrades. While these efficiency gains are important, they sometimes don’t help people in the greatest need.
Multifamily residents often bear disproportionally high energy burdens. Our research has shown they spend a larger share of their incomes on energy bills than do occupants of single-family homes, making it more difficult for them to afford necessities such as food or to save money for the future.  Using efficiency upgrades to reduce energy bills while improving the quality of multifamily housing is crucial.
Congress should include the GREAHT proposal as part of its major infrastructure and recovery investments. The nation’s renters deserve resilient affordable housing with healthy indoor air and reduced climate-changing emissions. Now is the time.

Energy Efficiency Funds in Infrastructure Bill Should Tee Up Historic Investments This Fall;"The infrastructure bill recently passed by the U.S. Senate includes billions of dollars in energy efficiency funding and should lay the groundwork for transformative investments needed ahead.
Thanks to key support from Senators Shaheen (D-NH), Portman (R-OH), and Manchin (D-WV), the bill includes major new funding for a series of efficiency investments. It also includes provisions, particularly in transportation, that are disappointing. The U.S. House, meanwhile, is considering a resolution this week that would advance both the infrastructure bill and the budget, which sets the template for a future “reconciliation” bill that can pass the Senate with only 51 votes.
As temperatures rise and wildfires spread, we need dramatic action to cut our greenhouse gas emissions. We estimate larger efficiency investments across buildings, industry, and transportation—if incorporated in an upcoming reconciliation bill—could add more than four million jobs, save almost $500 billion, and slash greenhouse emissions by more than 6 billion tons (see these analyses). That’s more than the total net U.S. greenhouse gas emissions for a year.
Here is a brief recap of several of the wins for energy efficiency in the Senate’s infrastructure bill and areas where we need to see far more—in other words, our priorities for the reconciliation bill ahead.
Efficiency programs and a clean electricity standard
The infrastructure bill includes $500 million for state energy offices and $550 million for local energy efficiency and conservation block grants to assist a broad range of state and local initiatives and financing, as well as several specific programs that state and local governments would run (some mentioned below).
The budget anticipates a “Clean Electricity Payment Program” to push utilities to clean generation through payments and fees. But as our recent issue brief and fact sheet discuss, we also need far more investment in efficiency and demand management to enable a cost-effective, equitable, and reliable clean grid and electrification.
Industrial decarbonization
The infrastructure bill includes $150 million to boost Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs), which help small manufacturing plants identify possible efficiency improvements, and a new $400 million grant program we proposed to help the plants implement them. It also includes $500 million for demonstration projects under last year’s Clean Industrial Technology Act and $50 million we sought for smart manufacturing, as well as billions of dollars for carbon capture and hydrogen technologies broadly, though with limited focus on industrial applications.
That’s a start. But other than Buy Clean proposals for procurement of products that are less carbon-intensive, industrial decarbonization has mostly been missing from the debate over the reconciliation bill. To decarbonize industry by 2050, we need to get moving now. We are working with members of Congress on proposals to enable commercial-scale applications of transformative technologies (First 3), transformation of industrial clusters, and effective energy management. 
Home and building retrofits and electrification
The infrastructure bill includes $3.5 billion for low-income home weatherization, a new revolving loan fund supporting commercial building and home upgrades, funds for public school and federal building upgrades, and worker training (including a program we proposed for commercial buildings similar to IACs).
Much more help is needed to upgrade homes and commercial buildings, and we are engaged in ongoing discussions on the HOPE for HOMES training and retrofit proposal, the GREAHT proposal for multifamily retrofits and electrification, and numerous proposals for rebates or tax credits for heat pumps and heat pump water heaters, including the Zero-Emission Homes Act.
Zero energy homes and buildings
The infrastructure bill includes $225 million for grants to states and others for implementation of building energy codes.
New homes and commercial buildings need to move rapidly beyond current codes to slash energy use on the way to zero-net energy. The Clean Energy for America Act, a collection of tax changes introduced in the Senate and intended for the reconciliation bill, would revamp current incentives to encourage zero-energy-ready homes and commercial buildings (as well as improved incentives for home and building upgrades). In addition, support for building and rehabilitating affordable housing should ensure residential buildings are built right so they don’t waste energy.
Electric vehicles and efficient transportation
The infrastructure bill encompasses the regular 5-year transportation bill (based on last year’s Senate proposal), which takes some comparatively small steps to address greenhouse gases from transportation, now the largest-emitting sector. It includes $7.5 billion aimed mostly to install more electric vehicle chargers and $2.5 billion for zero-emission school buses. While the bill allocates $39 billion more to public transportation and includes a new $6.4 billion loosely defined carbon-reduction program, it largely fails to reorient federal transportation funding away from highways toward more-efficient passenger and freight mobility options. Look for a separate blog post soon on the missed opportunity to create sound, climate-focused transportation policy.
For the reconciliation bill, we are especially supportive of incentives for electric trucks, which are behind electric cars in development (these are also in the Senate tax bill), as well as much more funding for universally accessible vehicle charging. We also need serious funding for climate-focused transportation programs with strong greenhouse gas emissions tracking and performance criteria for both passenger and freight transportation.
The biggest challenges are ahead
The hard work of turning the budget blueprint into a reconciliation bill that the Senate can pass with a simple majority will take several weeks or months, with committees due to submit their pieces of the overall legislation by September 15. Lawmakers have the opportunity to make historic efficiency investments across the economy that will reduce emissions, create jobs, and help consumers by reducing energy waste and costs.

Biden’s Efficiency Proposal for Manufactured Homes Must be Strengthened;"Washington, DC—A Biden administration proposal to set long-overdue efficiency standards for manufactured homes would yield some significant energy and carbon savings, but it risks allowing manufacturers to continue producing many inefficient models, leaving residents—including many low-income households—with high energy costs.
Energy efficiency requirements for manufactured homes (sometimes called mobile homes) have not been updated since 1994. The Department of Energy (DOE), in a proposed rule posted online this week, offers a “primary” option that would leave many homes with standards little stronger than those created nearly three decades ago (and weaker than those proposed by President Obama). It also presents an “alternative” option that is stronger, but still appears to miss significant opportunities to save residents money and cut greenhouse gas emissions.
“The department’s primary proposal would leave many low-income residents of manufactured homes with decades of high energy costs. The alternative proposal appears to be a better start, but the department needs to look at stronger options to reduce overall costs and emissions,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “For decades we’ve allowed the manufacturers to make poorly sealed, lightly insulated homes that waste a lot of heating and air conditioning and cause needless greenhouse gas emissions. To tackle this problem, the administration needs to develop a stronger standard in the final rule.”
Under DOE’s primary proposal, some homes would be required to have more insulation, better windows, and fewer drafts than today’s models. But others—those with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price under $55,000—would have a far weaker standard. That standard would leave residents paying more overall (when factoring both energy costs and home purchase prices) in the long run than they would if their homes were built to the standard proposed for higher-priced manufactured homes, according to DOE’s calculations.
The average sales price of a single-wide manufactured home has historically been close to the standard’s threshold, so the weak standard would apply to a sizable portion of the market, typically the lowest-income buyers. In addition, setting a retail price threshold risks gaming of the threshold and inadvertently shifting the market toward these less-efficient manufactured homes.
Under DOE’s alternative proposal, all new manufactured homes would need to meet the higher standard. Under the higher standard, residents of new single-wide homes would save $1,727 over 30 years (net of costs); residents of multi-section homes would save $2,511 over 30 years, according to DOE’s proposal. But DOE seemingly limited the scope to improving the efficiency of building components that were covered in a 2016 proposal, thus missing significant energy savings that are in the 2021 model energy code for site-built homes (which by law must be the starting point for this standard).
About 100,000 new manufactured homes are shipped each year. The median household income for people living in manufactured homes is $33,000, making them one of the most important types of low-income housing in the United States. Residents of manufactured homes typically spend $1,750 on energy each year. A quarter of residents of manufactured homes have severe energy burdens, meaning they spend more than 10% of their income on energy costs, ACEEE has found.
While most new home construction is governed by state or municipal building energy codes, manufactured homes, which are made in facilities that may ship to multiple states, are regulated by the federal government. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) sets a building code for the homes, but it has not updated the energy provisions since 1994.
Recognizing the need to reduce wasted energy in these homes, Congress—in a bipartisan energy bill in 2007—directed DOE to develop and finalize a separate energy standard for manufactured homes by 2011. The Obama administration issued a proposal in 2016, but DOE has still not issued a final standard. The Sierra Club sued DOE over its failure to publish a rule by the legal deadline; the department agreed in a settlement to propose a new standard by August 16, 2021 and publish a final rule by May 15, 2022.
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), a nonprofit research organization, develops policies to reduce energy waste and combat climate change. Its independent analysis advances investments, programs, and behaviors that use energy more effectively and help build an equitable clean energy future.

Congress Can Pass a Carbon-Cutting Energy Efficiency Standard via Reconciliation Bill;"A national energy efficiency standard could dramatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions, by an amount that exceeds those from all passenger vehicles in the United States for a year, ACEEE found in an analysis published today. The policy, which Congress could approve with a simple majority via a budget reconciliation bill, could also cut enough energy waste to save households and businesses about $160 billion on energy bills over the 2022-2050 period.
President Biden has proposed an energy efficiency and clean electricity standard (EECES), although details have not been offered. Today, 27 states have energy efficiency resource standards (EERS) that require electric and often gas utilities to save a certain amount of energy by providing incentives to customers who buy efficient equipment or weatherize their homes or buildings.
We developed the specifics of how this proven policy could be implemented nationally while meeting budget reconciliation rules and analyzed the impacts. We found that over the 2022-2050 period, a federal efficiency standard could reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 1400-2400 MMT (depending on how clean the U.S. power grid becomes). The lower end is equivalent to the carbon emissions from 304 million passenger vehicles in a year, while the upper end is equivalent to the combined annual emissions of Texas, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, New York, and Michigan. This is about double the emissions avoided by the most effective federal carbon reduction investments analyzed in our June 2021 fact sheet.
As described in a recent ACEEE policy brief, an energy efficiency standard can complement a clean energy standard because it reduces the amount of electricity demand that must be met with clean energy to meet climate and air quality goals. As a result, it reduces the cost of a clean energy standard to utilities and their customers and can enable greater carbon savings. It also provides many other benefits, such as increased home comfort and improved health.
Under our proposal for a federal standard, Congress would authorize the Department of Energy to set customized energy efficiency targets for medium and large electric and gas utilities (about 373 electric and 165 gas utilities); smaller utilities would not be covered. Each utility’s 2022 target is based on the savings it achieved in 2021. Starting in 2023, each utility’s target for new savings would increase by 0.25% each year, up to specified caps. A utility’s total energy savings would grow rapidly as new savings combine with continued savings from previous years’ measures still saving energy.
A utility achieving savings in excess of its target would receive payments from the federal government; a fee would be charged for shortfalls. We expect that federal payments and fees would approximately balance each other.
A federal energy efficiency standard is an important component of efforts to meet the new U.S. goal under the Paris Agreement of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% by 2030, compared to a 2005 baseline. Achieving this climate target will be difficult, even using all available tools. But without a federal energy efficiency standard, meeting the target would be more expensive, more wasteful, and less likely.

Cities Are Using an Emerging Model to Boost Renewables, but What about Energy Efficiency?;"Across the United States, more local governments are adopting a utility alternative for providing customers with electricity that boosts use of renewable energy. Yet most taking this option—known as community choice aggregation (CCA)—do not yet pursue energy-saving initiatives that can help meet climate goals, according to the first report ever to assess the role of energy efficiency in CCA.
The ACEEE report, published today, shows community choice aggregators (CCAs) are gaining momentum, with hundreds active in several states and new ones starting this year in Providence and other cities in Rhode Island. Formed by one or more local governments, CCAs give customers an alternative to the local utility. While the utility still transmits electricity, manages billing, and provides other services, often including energy efficiency programs, CCAs procure electricity from alternative sources, such as wind and solar. They generally offer electricity mixes with higher renewable content that is cost competitive with the local utility.
So far, nine states have passed legislation allowing CCAs, and Maryland recently empowered Montgomery County to pursue a pilot program.[1] While many CCAs aim to increase renewables and reduce climate-warming emissions, they can also address equity issues by lowering energy bills for residents struggling to make ends meet. Whether the goal is to reduce emissions, reduce costs, or both, energy efficiency can help.
By surveying CCAs, our report recommends ways they can overcome the regulatory and cost challenges that often stymie them from incorporating energy efficiency.
Source: Lean Energy U.S.
Current Energy Efficiency Approaches
Most CCAs either do not engage in energy efficiency at all or they connect their customers to existing utility-administered programs. However, CCAs have lots of opportunities to leverage energy efficiency. For example, Valley Clean Energy, which serves several cities in California, offers a hub for customers to access energy-saving opportunities available to them through utilities, tax incentives, and other sources. Some cities offer energy-saving options separate from their CCA. For example, Cincinnati administers WarmUp Cincy, which offers energy assessments, upgrades, education, and bill assistance to low-income residents. While Cincinnati has a CCA, the CCA is not directly involved in WarmUp Cincy.
We have identified CCAs, though, that administer their own varying energy efficiency initiatives, such as rebates for buying energy-saving appliances. With the exception of Cape Light Compact in Massachusetts, all of these CCAs operate in California.
—In the San Francisco Bay Area, Marin Clean Energy (MCE) offers its customers several opportunities in addition to those provided by the local utility. Such options include its Low-Income Families and Tenants Pilot Program that provides rebates for a variety of energy- and water-saving products, such as furnaces, appliances, water heaters, and windows. Over the lifetime of its energy efficiency programs, MCE has saved its customers $11.7 million.
—In Massachusetts, Cape Light Compact’s energy efficiency services have saved customers more than $100 million since the services began in 2001. Cape Light Compact offers financial incentives for energy-efficient new home construction. Customers also have access to zero-interest loans and rebates for energy efficiency projects, as well as comprehensive energy assessments.
—In Northern California, Redwood Coast Energy Authority has supported energy efficiency in schools and residential and commercial buildings. It has provided expertise and organizational support for 22 school districts implementing energy efficiency measures, such as fuel substitution and improvements to refrigeration, HVAC,  and hot water systems. over the past five years. Through its own funds, Redwood Coast provided more than 250 residential energy consultations and 90 residential energy efficiency kits to its customers in 2020 and provided no-cost energy assessments to commercial customers.
Recommendations, Strategies, and Challenges
CCAs may be able to strengthen existing energy efficiency efforts of utilities and governments by targeting hard-to-reach customers and leveraging relationships in their community.
Compared to CCAs, most utilities have greater financial resources and longer histories of offering energy efficiency services. So, if the programs already available to a given CCA‘s customers (via the utility) are strong, effective, and equitable, then the CCA may best serve its customers’ interests by directing them to existing programs.
However, if a CCA finds that existing utility programs are not reaching all customers or are otherwise inadequate, developing its own programming may be advisable. A CCA’s capacity, regulatory context, community needs, and existing local offerings should guide its approach. CCA programs can often help distribute the costs and benefits of energy equitably by understanding the demographics and needs of their communities.
Some CCAs explicitly identify equity as a program goal, and more should do the same. There is room for all CCAs to do more to contribute better societal outcomes and incorporate accountability for equity into their initiatives. As more communities pursue a CCA to reach their climate goals, this report provides a resource on how energy efficiency can play a vital role.

Biden Administration Takes Major Step to Ensure Light Bulbs Don’t Waste Energy;"Washington, DC—To reduce climate-warming emissions and save consumers money, the Biden administration took a major step today to finally ensure that light bulbs don't waste energy. In a rule, the Department of Energy (DOE) proposed that some of the most common types of bulbs be required to meet federal standards for energy efficiency.
The bulbs at issue are used in two billion sockets in the United States. They include reflector bulbs used in recessed and track lighting, candle-shaped bulbs used in wall sconces and other decorative light fixtures, and globe-shaped bulbs often installed in bathrooms.
The DOE reiterated today that it is considering an additional step to ensure these light bulbs as well as pear-shaped bulbs—used in another 3.4 billion sockets—do not waste most of the energy they use by converting it to heat. In May, the department solicited initial public comment on that step, which would require that bulbs produce at least 45 lumens per watt (a measure of how much visible light is produced for a given amount of electricity) by reinstating a ""backstop"" standard Congress set in 2007 that is easy for today's LED light bulbs to meet.
“This saga is winding to an end and the question now is whether the manufacturers are going to be able to squeeze out a few more years of profits from these wasteful products,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “The Biden administration needs to get this done promptly because every extra month energy-wasting bulbs are sold locks in $300 million in needless energy costs for consumers.”
The cost to the climate of a full extra year of delay in phasing out incandescent light bulbs would be 9.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, according to an analysis by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) submitted to DOE. That’s equivalent to the emissions from two million cars operating for a year.
“We’re talking about 19th century technology that burns out every year, which has worked out much better for the sellers than for the buyers,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of ASAP. “The LED options are so affordable and last so long that it’s just predatory at this point to sell incandescent bulbs that cost a lot to use and need to be replaced frequently.”
The Obama administration’s DOE—directed by law to consider updating which bulb types should be exempted from federal efficiency standards—determined in January 2017 that several types of common bulbs should not be exempted. It also said that the legal backstop had been triggered, setting the stage for the 45-lumen-per-watt standard to take effect at the beginning of 2020.
After President Trump entered office, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)—a trade group representing major light bulb manufacturers (Philips [now known as Signify], General Electric, and Sylvania/LEDVANCE)—sued DOE over the Obama rules. The Trump administration settled with NEMA that year, committing to revisit the issue. DOE issued two final rules in 2019, one reinstating the exemptions and the other asserting that the backstop standard had not been triggered.
Since then, California and Nevada have implemented 45-lumen-per-watt standards. Consumers in those states are already guaranteed efficient bulbs, generally LEDs. A typical incandescent bulb emits approximately 15 lumens per watt; in comparison, its LED equivalent emits more than 100 lumens per watt.
Nationally, while sales of LED bulbs have grown rapidly, the newest data available show that about 30% of light bulbs sold in 2020 (in states excluding California) were still incandescent or halogen incandescent bulbs.
In June, NEMA submitted comments to DOE asking the agency for another year of continued manufacturing and importing of inefficient bulbs followed by a year more to sell out stockpiled inventory. Signify, the world's largest lighting company, seconded the request for more time to make or import wasteful bulbs, followed by the ability to sell the bulbs for a to-be-determined period. The People’s Republic of China called for a “transition period of at least three years.” By law, the backstop should have become effective in January 2020. 
DOE has until the end of the year to potentially finalize today’s proposal as well as a possible action reinstating the backstop standards, based on provisions of an executive order from President Biden and a subsequent memo from DOE.

Its independent analysis advances investments, programs, and behaviors that use energy more effectively and help build an equitable clean energy future.

Five States Set Appliance Efficiency Standards in Banner Year;"As much of the United States continues to suffer from drought and extreme heat, five states have adopted energy- and water-saving appliance standards since late March, a rapid series of victories for consumers, businesses, and the climate. The new state laws in Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Rhode Island will require minimum energy- and water-use efficiency levels for more than 15 types of products including air purifiers, computers, and restaurant equipment. The standards will reduce utility bills and carbon dioxide emissions, bringing each state closer to meeting their climate goals.
This year’s momentum builds on other recent victories, with 11 jurisdictions in total—also including California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Vermont, and Washington—adopting standards since 2018. And legislation is still pending in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Despite this progress, more states need to cut emissions and pave the path for new national standards that deliver even larger reductions in climate-warming emissions.
State and federal standards work in concert
Historically, state standards have been the impetus for federal action. Standards for most of the roughly 60 products regulated at the federal level started out in the states. While states take the lead in creating standards for products that are not yet included in the federal program, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is working to catch up on a backlog of reviews of existing federal standards inherited from the prior administration to make sure they are keeping pace with efficiency improvements.
In most cases, the new state standards require a minimum amount of water or energy efficiency for products that have no federal standard. The exceptions have been several water-using products, such as faucets and showerheads, where DOE granted states permission years ago to set stronger standards than the federal ones.
More-efficient equipment in homes and businesses
This year marks several firsts. Massachusetts adopted the first standards for electric vehicle chargers, a critical step as vehicle charging is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. Nevada was the first state to adopt standards for gas fireplaces and air purifiers (the District of Columbia adopted air purifier standards in December 2020). As the air purifier market grows quickly in response to wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important that consumers have access to efficient products.
Oregon became the second state, after Washington, to adopt a standard for grid-enabled water heaters. The standard requires electric water heaters to be able to automatically adjust their power usage in response to changes in electricity prices or the needs of the power grid. This feature will allow utilities to scale up valuable demand response programs, which can save consumers money, reduce the need to operate polluting peaker power plants, and potentially prevent dangerous blackouts. Nevada legislators authorized their state energy office to adopt similar grid-enabled standards for energy-intensive appliances like air conditioners and water heaters.
We estimate that the combined standards will save residents of the five states $470 million on their utility bills annually by 2035 and cut cumulative greenhouse gas emissions through 2035 by 4.3 million metric tons—an amount equivalent to removing 935,000 cars from the road for a year. The standards will also save nearly 16 billion gallons of water annually by 2035.
Standards for products such as faucets or lawn spray sprinklers are especially important for drought-prone states, particularly in the west. California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington have already adopted standards for a handful of water-using products. Other western states that face similar challenges, such as Utah and Arizona, have not yet set such standards. However, time is of the essence. Bold leadership is needed as droughts are certain to worsen. Fortunately, state legislatures looking for new ways to combat water shortages, save residents money, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions can do so with efficiency standards.
Tackle climate emissions with state and federal progress 
But state-based initiatives alone are not sufficient. We need national momentum. The good news is that when numerous states make progress, it creates momentum for federal standards. Carbon emissions will decrease faster as states and DOE continue to work on parallel tracks to adopt new and updated efficiency standards. This is why state leadership on energy efficiency standards has never been more important.

Biden’s Proposed Car Standards Come Far Short of Undoing Damage of Trump Rollback;"Washington, DC—The Biden administration today proposed to decrease the emissions of new passenger vehicles, but it did not go far enough to make up for the extra greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by the prior administration’s rollback of clean car standards. The standards proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency would at best recapture only 67% of the emission cuts that would have occurred under the prior Obama-era rules, according to calculations by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
President Biden has set ambitious 2030 climate goals, but to undo the damage caused by the weakened Trump standards, his new proposal needed to significantly exceed targets set by President Obama. His proposal falls far short of what is needed to regain lost ground. But the administration still has the ability to be more ambitious with the final rule. Tackling passenger vehicle emissions is crucial as transportation is the top emitter of GHG in the United States.
“We need to not just catch up to the Obama standards but make up for emissions caused by the Trump rollback. We have to fully reclaim the emissions reductions from the Obama standards if we are to have any chance of meeting our long-term climate goals. This proposal doesn’t take advantage of how far electric and hybrid vehicles have advanced in the market. We’re in a very different place than we were in 2012 and the rules need to reflect what we know is possible now,” said Peter Huether, senior research analyst for transportation at ACEEE.
The proposed standard includes a one-time 10% increase in stringency for model year 2023, followed by 5% per year increases in stringency through model year 2026. However, it maintains many flexibilities that reduce the overall ambition and emissions reductions. The GHG rules would bring us only to the gasoline equivalent of 51 miles per gallon (MPG) in model year 2026 compared to the 59 MPG equivalent we need to recover the Obama emissions reductions. 59 mpg equivalent is the minimum target needed to reestablish momentum in the United States auto industry toward greater efficiency and electrification of our passenger vehicles.
The proposal also extends counterproductive giveaways to automakers for producing electric vehicles (EVs). Treating EVs as entirely zero-emission vehicles—which they are not—and giving them extra weight when calculating an automaker’s average efficiency will only increase overall emissions.

Industry Decarbonization Risks Getting Shortchanged in Upcoming Trillion-Dollar Bill;"The bipartisan infrastructure bill that is poised to pass the U.S. Senate includes modest steps to reduce energy waste and emissions—a sort of down payment toward decarbonizing the U.S. economy. Congressional Democrats are aiming for more significant provisions this fall as part of the budget reconciliation bill, which requires a simple majority to pass. So far, Washington debate over potential climate provisions has focused on the power, transportation, and buildings sectors. But Congress should not overlook industry.
The industrial sector accounts for more than one-fourth of U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Its decarbonization will require a multi-pronged approach that includes energy management, new lower-carbon industrial processes, switching to electricity and carbon-free fuels, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).
Such decarbonization will require early investments because of the long lifetimes of equipment, the time required to transform production, competition with other countries, and industry’s role in multiple supply chains.  
The bipartisan bill has some industrial efficiency and decarbonization provisions. It provides $500 million for demonstration projects under the Clean Industrial Technology Act enacted by Congress last year. It devotes more than $2.5 billion to CCUS, some of which will be in the industrial sector. It provides $150 million to expand the Industrial Assessment Center program that provides energy audits to small industrial firms while also training engineering students in energy management. It also includes $400 million in grants to help small industrial firms implement audit recommendations.
Yet much more is needed if we are to meet the U.S. goal of a 50%–52% reduction from 2005 levels in GHG emissions by 2030 as we push to decarbonize the entire economy by 2050.
Decarbonizing industry can provide a lot of “bang for the buck.” In ACEEE’s analysis of potential efficiency investments, released in June, industry accounted for 11% of the spending in our “base package” but 71% of the emission reductions. This package includes $107 billion in spending and estimated long-term carbon dioxide emissions reductions (cumulative reductions over 2022–2050) of 2,410 million metric tons across all sectors of the U.S. economy. Those reductions equal the carbon emitted by more than 600 coal-fired power plants in 1 year.
Several important industrial provisions in our analysis do not appear to be included in reconciliation discussions. The biggest item is a proposal for the Department of Energy (DOE) to co-fund the first three commercial-scale applications of transformative industrial technologies, such as the direct reduction of iron ore using hydrogen, which can reduce carbon emissions of primary steelmaking about 97% relative to processes used today. A couple members of Congress are planning to introduce legislation to establish this program soon.
Also in development by a House member is a proposal for DOE to provide competitive grants to consortia working on decarbonization and supply chain challenges facing regional industrial clusters (described in a recent ACEEE blog).
Programs to assist medium and large industrial firms with energy management and decarbonization are important as well, including the Flex-Tech program covered in a bill recently introduced by Rep. Paul Tonko (NY) and several proposals now being developed by other legislators. ACEEE fact sheets provide additional information on these proposals, which together will need about $15 billion in federal funding over the next decade.
For the United States to decarbonize by 2050, industry must play a critical role. Congress should include—not overlook—programs that advance industrial decarbonization in its upcoming budget reconciliation legislation. Federal investments can spur large emissions reductions in the sector and will assist U.S. firms to best compete in a decarbonized world.

Energy Equity for Renters Initiative Kicks Off with Guide for Cities;"Dramatically cutting home energy use is essential to achieving the Paris Agreement’s emission-reduction targets and averting the worst impacts of climate change. We need an aggressive campaign of energy-efficiency retrofits, appliance upgrades, and decarbonization of electricity sources. In pursuing all three, we cannot afford to ignore the more than one-third of American households that currently rent their homes.
To focus on this crucial market segment, today ACEEE launched the Energy Equity for Renters initiative and published a guide to help city policymakers improve the efficiency of rentals in existing buildings.
Rentals consume 15% more energy on a per-square-foot basis and have 30% higher energy costs than other homes. Although new construction gives us the opportunity to build efficient homes from the ground up, it can be particularly difficult to realize meaningful efficiency gains in existing rental housing.
Local governments concerned with the climate crisis, housing affordability, and energy burdens should have special motivation to improve rental energy efficiency. Nearly one-third of renter households have high energy burdens (i.e., they spend more than 6% of their income on energy bills). Compounding this problem, landlords who have lost rental revenue during the pandemic may be forced to delay maintenance and upgrades that would have lowered energy bills and greenhouse gas emissions.
Upgrading rental properties to be more efficient without paying attention to housing affordability runs the risk of creating housing that is only accessible to high-income residents.
Our new guide explains that if cities want to preserve—and hopefully grow—their stock of affordable housing, they must stipulate this as a priority, build and maintain partnerships within and outside local government, and design initiatives with low-income renters and renters of color in mind.
Take the example of Minneapolis, MN, featured in the guide. The 4d Affordable Housing Incentive program helps owners of unregulated affordable housing qualify for a state property tax abatement. Property owners can reduce their taxes by keeping at least 20% of units affordable to low-income residents. Participating properties can also join the city’s 4d Energy Efficiency program, which provides up to $50,000 in retrofit incentives per building. Our new guide features several case study cities and shows how cities can maximize the number of homes reached and achieve deep energy savings.
ACEEE’s initiative recognizes that renters deserve to benefit from advances in energy-saving technology just as much as owners, and that collectively we all benefit from upgrading our housing stock and preserving affordable housing. It has three main components:
Continue the successful collaboration between ACEEE and the Urban Sustainability Directors Network. Since summer 2020, this working group has provided a platform for local governments to exchange information about policies and programs designed to equitably improve the energy efficiency of rental properties.
Work closely with a few cities and community-based organizations to prioritize energy efficiency. We will provide targeted, customized technical assistance in at least five cities to help local governments and community-based organizations design and implement programs.
Track new policies, including through ACEEE’s City Clean Energy Scorecard, and provide update on notable policies.

DOE Moves to Ensure Dishwashers, Washers, and Dryers Don’t Guzzle Energy and Water;"Washington, DC — A Department of Energy (DOE) proposed rule announced today would ensure that all new dishwashers, clothes washers, and dryers meet federal energy and water efficiency standards set years ago. The proposal, if finalized, would effectively undo two rules issued last year by the previous administration that could allow certain models to use unlimited energy and water.
The 2020 rules created separate “product classes” for dishwashers and clothes washers and dryers that have a short cycle as the “normal” cycle, effectively absolving such models of the need to meet existing energy and water standards. These models could use unlimited energy and water because DOE has not set a standard for them. Fortunately, no major manufacturer has created a model so far to exploit the loophole and many publicly opposed the 2020 rules.
“This was a silly but dangerous loophole that could be exploited to make products that waste wild amounts of energy and water, and it’s good that they’re closing it,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP).
The 2020 rules were unneeded because the vast majority of today’s dishwashers already offer short cycles, which in some instances consume modestly more energy than the default cycles but are used infrequently, according to surveys. And many clothes washer and dryer models already have short cycle times and meet the efficiency standards.
“Now the task is for the Department to promptly strengthen the standards for each of these products, because they’re years past the deadlines,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
At the time of President Biden’s inauguration, DOE had missed 28 legal deadlines for reviewing efficiency standards – including for dishwashers, clothes washers, and dryers. Many more are coming due in the years ahead. ASAP and ACEEE are urging the Biden administration to move quickly to #RaiseTheStandards to save consumers money and reduce climate change-causing emissions.
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), a nonprofit research organization, develops policies to reduce energy waste and combat climate change. Its independent analysis advances investments, programs, and behaviors that use energy more effectively and help build an equitable clean energy future.

Analysis: Congress Should Adopt Biden’s Energy Efficiency and Clean Electricity Standard;"Washington, DC—To cut the climate-warming emissions that are intensifying heat waves, droughts, and wildfires, Congress should adopt energy-saving targets as part of President Biden’s proposal for a federal energy efficiency and clean electricity standard (EECES), the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy argues in an analysis released today. The plan would build on state policies that are saving enough additional electricity each year to power two million homes by incentivizing utility customers to make efficiency upgrades.
Biden proposed an EECES in his American Jobs Plan, echoing a 2020 campaign proposal in his clean energy plan. This week, noting the “devastation” of climate change that “Americans across the country can see and feel,” he social media to again back the policy. The administration has not yet offered details on how the plan would incorporate energy efficiency.
Successful programs in 27 states and the District of Columbia show vast promise for national energy-saving targets. These states have set their own energy efficiency resource standards (EERS) that require electric and often gas utilities to save a certain amount of energy through efficiency programs for customers. These efforts include measures such as discounts on efficient appliances and equipment and technical assistance to companies to improve energy management.
ACEEE has found that states with these standards have an average of 4 times the level of electricity savings from utility programs (1.2% new savings per year) relative to states without them (0.3%), with large programs saving electricity at just 2.4 cents/kilowatt-hour. In 2019, programs under these standards saved an additional 22 billion kilowatt-hours—enough to power at least two million homes for a year. Continued savings from measures taken in previous years were far higher. Yet much of the country has no such standard today, and the stringency of the policies varies widely among states that do.
“We need to move to clean energy far more rapidly, and reducing the amount of energy we waste is a critical tool to get there,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of ACEEE. “Using electricity more efficiently will lower costs, help us integrate renewable energy, and offset added demand as we electrify more of our economy. Biden was right to include this in his plan, but Congress needs to work on the details and pass it.""
Most states with binding renewable or clean energy standards also have an EERS. The new analysis argues that ramping up energy savings will provide immediate reductions in greenhouse emissions because three-fifths of utility-scale electricity generation is still from fossil fuels.
Investing in energy efficiency will help speed and lower the cost of transitioning to renewable energy. It will lessen the need for using fossil fuels at peak times, help speed the retirement of fossil fuel plants, and avoid the building of new ones. As electricity for heating continues to increase, efficiency and demand management programs can reduce demand spikes on winter mornings, which are hard to meet using renewable sources.
By guaranteeing increased investment in utility efficiency programs, energy efficiency standards offer regulatory certainty for utilities and the contractors, manufacturers, and retailers that make up the efficiency workforce and supply network.
The ACEEE analysis argues that Congress could adopt energy efficiency targets separate from a clean energy standard or could combine them. It could take either approach through the reconciliation process, which requires a simple majority vote in the Senate, by levying fees on utilities for underperformance in meeting energy efficiency targets and providing payments for overperformance.

To Undo the Damage of Trump Rollbacks, Biden Needs to Set Car Standards Stronger than Obama’s;"The Biden administration can soon undo the damage of President Trump’s clean car rollback, but only by setting more stringent standards to make up for lost progress. In the face of recent climate change-related extreme heat and flooding events, the administration can’t afford to lose this opportunity when it proposes new standards, due this month. 
We modeled the impact of several options. We found that, at a minimum, Biden would need to ramp up to a fleetwide standard of 55 miles per gallon-equivalent (mpg) or 161 grams per mile (gpm) of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by the 2026 model year to undo the damage of the less-efficient models being sold now because of the Trump rollback.  
Anything less ambitious would bring several more years of needlessly inefficient vehicles, locking in 15 years or more of extra greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. If the administration set standards that simply reached the same fleetwide average as the Obama standards by 2026, it would recover only two-thirds of the emissions reductions possible under the Obama program. Achieving the President’s climate goal of a 50-52% reduction in overall emissions by 2030 almost certainly requires stronger action.  
Obama vs. Trump Standards 
The Obama administration’s standards, set in 2012, required approximately 4.7% annual growth in efficiency for model years (MY) 2021 to 2025, reaching 47 mpg-equivalent or 190 gpm (this is below the originally announced figure of 54.5 mpg largely due to a larger than expected share of vehicles sold being light trucks rather than cars). However, the Trump administration undid these standards with the Safe Affordable Fuel Efficient (SAFE) rule, which requires only 1.5% annual growth. ACEEE’s analysis found that the SAFE rule would mean losing almost 80% of the lifetime emissions reductions for MYs 2021-2026 compared to the Obama standards. Some of this damage is already done: The MY 2021 and 2022 cars are here. At stake now are the standards for the 2023-2026 model years.   
Possibilities for a New Standard 
The standards for MY2023-2026 could take a variety of forms. Below we highlight the impacts of possibilities discussed by observers.  
California MOU Standard 
To ensure momentum in vehicle efficiency, in 2019 California announced it had reached a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with four automakers (now five) to require an annual growth rate of 3.7% for these automakers. While this is an improvement over the Trump standard, it still provides fewer emissions benefits than the original Obama standards.  
One possibility mentioned in the press is using the California MOU as the basis for new federal standards. This would mean a 3.7% annual growth rate for all automakers for MY 2023-2026, not just the five current signatories to the deal. We found that this standard would recover only about 31% of the possible emissions reductions under the Obama standards for MY 2021-2026, reaching 43 mpg-equivalent or 205 gpm by the 2026. This is a result of both smaller annual improvements in efficiency and added flexibilities given to automakers in the MOU. The biggest flexibility is that automakers can meet one percentage point of the 3.7% annual growth by giving extra weight to electric vehicles (EVs) sold. This is known as the “EV multiplier” and is explained further below. Our analysis assumes that in all scenarios, EVs reach about 10% of new light-duty vehicles sales by 2026.
Obama Fleetwide Average  
If the new standards were to reach the same fleetwide average efficiency in 2026 as the original Obama standards, they would recover only two-thirds of the emissions savings of the Obama standards. This means that lifetime emissions for MY 2021-2026 would be about 6% higher than if the Obama standards were never rolled back.  
This scenario assumes that the standards account for the emissions from the electricity powering EVs, called “upstream accounting” (explained below) and that there are no multipliers for EVs. Without upstream accounting and with EV multipliers, the annual rate would have to be higher to avoid more erosion in emissions reductions. Because we need to make up for lost time because of the Trump rollback, simply achieving the improvement rate of the Obama standards would be insufficient.
Full Emissions Reduction Standard 
To recover the full emissions reductions that the Obama standards would have delivered, the new standards would need to reach a compliance level of at least 55 mpg-equivalent or 161 gpm by MY 2026. This would make up for near stagnation in the standards for model years 2021 and 2022 by surpassing the Obama standard for MY 2026, which is 47 mpg-equivalent or 190 gpm. This ambitious rate of growth can be achieved using current technology and increased electrification, with both greater use of hybrid technology and full battery-electric vehicles. Since the Obama standards were first introduced, technology has advanced rapidly with more affordable and high-performing hybrids and EVs. We should not limit our ambition to the assumptions of 10 years ago when designing new standards.
This scenario also assumes upstream EV accounting is included and that and no EV multiplier flexibilities are provided to maximize emissions reductions from the new MY 2023-2026 standard. Appropriately accounting for EVs can have a significant impact on real-world emissions and is increasingly important as EVs proliferate. If either or both of these assumptions do not hold, the annual growth rate from the new Biden standards will need to be 1-2 percentage points higher.
Impact of Compliance Flexibilities  
If the Biden administration were to build in flexibilities like those in the California MOU, the ambition of the standard would be significantly reduced. EV multipliers allow automakers to give extra weight to EVs (often 1.5 or 2x weight) when calculating their fleetwide average, which means that they can use EVs to offset the sales of larger, higher-emitting vehicles. Automakers need to meet an annual sales-weighted average efficiency level and the EV multipliers give disproportionate weight to EVs, which are generally more efficient. This means that each electric model sold actually increases overall fleetwide emissions despite EVs themselves emitting less. Also, while the multipliers may have been introduced to spur EV sales, there is evidence to suggest they are not having that effect and may actually hinder EV sales. The Obama standards included a phase-out of these multipliers by MY 2021. 
Another major flexibility involves not counting upstream emissions for EVs. This means that EVs are treated as entirely zero-emission vehicles, which ignores the carbon dioxide emissions from generating the electricity they run on. This treatment, like the EV multiplier, gives too much credit to EVs and increases overall emissions by allowing automakers to sell less efficient internal-combustion engine vehicles. The lack of upstream accounting can actually make the negative effect of EV multipliers worse. Because EV multipliers give greater weight to EVs in compliance, if EVs are also treated as having zero emissions, their sales make it even easier for automakers to comply while selling inefficient vehicles. Both of these flexibilities should be avoided in the upcoming standards.
The Biden administration has an important opportunity with these standards to set the United States on a course for greater fuel efficiency, increased vehicle electrification, and larger GHG emission reductions from vehicles. If we are to meet our national greenhouse gas emissions targets, it is vital that, at a minimum, the new standards fully recover the benefits of the Obama program.

With Schools Set to Reopen, U.S. Needs to Help Them Clean the Air and Save Energy;"If each K-12 student in the United States were to bring a check for more than $3,000 to their school and ask for a healthier school environment in return, how should the school spend that money? That is the multibillion-dollar question all schools are facing during their budget planning this summer as they prepare to receive a vast infusion of federal relief funds.
This funding, totaling $190.5 billion via the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) fund, gives schools an unprecedented opportunity to make vital improvements. They can benefit by improving ventilation as part of a broader retrofit that includes more efficient heating and cooling. This win-win strategy can reduce the risk of virus transmission and exposure to environmental health hazards and, at the same time, reduce energy waste and utility bills.
Schools need to act swiftly—and wisely. Cranking up ventilation without a holistic HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) approach could increase energy use and climate-warming emissions. The federal relief funds can plant seeds for change, but schools need more support to upgrade effectively and address competing priorities. We need to think creatively to leverage additional resources—as outlined in this post—to help schools achieve multiple goals at once.
Schools face serious challenges
Although the United States spends heavily on education, significant funding gaps still exist, particularly in most minority and low-income school districts. According to a study by the Century Foundation, the total funding gap is $150 billion, and low-income school districts are more than twice as likely to have a funding gap as higher-income districts.  
Many schools also have aging and inadequate facilities. An estimated 41% of public school districts need to update or replace HVAC systems in at least half of their schools, representing approximately 36,000 schools nationwide, according to a 2020 Government Accounting Office (GAO) report. Another field study, published by science journal Indoor Air, revealed that 87% of the sampled classrooms had ventilation rates below levels recommended by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). It also found that these ventilation rates are correlated with students’ academic achievement.
Schools need to combat several chronic respiratory or communicable diseases, not just the coronavirus causing COVID-19. About 7% of children have asthma, and the number has been increasing every year, especially among Black children. And let’s not forget influenza viruses and rhinovirus, the predominant cause of the common cold. As schools make classroom sanitization their top priority, cleaning products that contain volatile organic compounds can cause adverse health effects, such as asthma attacks, upper respiratory irritation, and fatigue. In addition to hygiene and sanitation practices, effective ventilation is a key measure to ensure a healthy indoor environment in schools.
Federal relief funds present an unprecedented opportunity
The federal relief funds aim to help schools address the many impacts of COVID-19 on education. Schools can use the funds to hire additional teachers, pay for extended learning and enrichment programs, and buy technological devices to assist remote learning. They can also use the money to improve ventilation, not only to reopen quickly and safely, but also to pay for an enormous backlog of projects that address deferred maintenance and overdue capital improvements.
While the federal ESSER funding amounts to an average of $3,378 per student nationwide ($190.5 billion divided by 56.4 million K-12 enrollments in 2020), it will be distributed to states based on their share of Title I funding. In other words, states with a higher share of low-income students will get relatively more funding.
Unfortunately, there are few comprehensive statewide assessments to determine school facilities' needs and this task is left to school districts. Many schools have competing priorities, especially those in disadvantaged communities. Indoor air quality and energy efficiency are not likely the top priorities for school boards or principals. On average, schools spent slightly more than 8% of their budget on operation and maintenance in the past two decades.
Improving ventilation is a complicated task. Many schools cannot implement the recommended strategies for improving indoor air quality to minimize the risk of coronavirus or other indoor virus transmissions because of outdated HVAC systems, according to a joint report by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and ASHRAE.
Without a comprehensive facility assessment and upgrade planning, adding high-efficiency filters or increasing outdoor air supply is like putting a band-aid on a broken leg. After a class-action lawsuit alleged that a company misrepresented how well its air cleaning devices protect against the spread of the coronavirus, a Newark, California, school district had to disconnect more than 550 classroom air treatment devices costing nearly $360,000.
Energy community should help schools achieve goals
Modernizing aging school facilities is a long-term effort that requires significant investments from the public and private sectors. We recommend that federal agencies, local governments, utilities, nonprofit organizations, and other stakeholders collectively take the following steps to mobilize resources and provide technical and financial support.
— Conduct statewide facilities’ assessment to identify and prioritize needs. The GAO report revealed that most states do not conduct statewide assessments to determine school facilities’ needs. Local education agencies, which will receive at least 90% of the ESSER funding, need help from energy experts to develop quick and feasible ways to assess schools’ efficiency and indoor air conditions.
— Broaden communication with school districts and align efficiency with health and academic goals. Although the Better Buildings Initiative at the Department of Energy (DOE) has engaged 40 school districts as partners, that is less than 3% of the 13,800 public school districts in the United States. We need to broaden stakeholder groups and create more effective communication with educators—helping local education agencies, school boards, and other stakeholders understand the synergy among energy efficiency, carbon reduction, indoor air quality, and student academic performance. 
Numerous studies have proven that a healthy indoor environment has a direct positive impact on students’ physical and mental health and their academic performance. Illness results in 184 million missed school days each year nationwide, hurting academic performance and possibly widening income-based achievement gaps. For example, absenteeism has a more substantial impact on the performance of Hispanic English language learners. Efficient building systems not only reduce carbon emissions but also provide a more comfortable and healthier indoor environment at a lower operation and maintenance cost.
— Support schools to develop customized strategies at scale. Based on experiences and challenges from 47 school districts, the USGBC/ASHRAE report noted that these districts want a customized plan to address their unique circumstances. Schools could start by monitoring indoor air quality and use the data to develop performance-based ventilation practices. Many schools may not know that they have indoor air quality problems. Indoor air sensors are fairly affordable and easy to use. Local universities and nonprofit organizations could lend their expertise and volunteer technical support.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Health Learning Environments and DOE’s Better Buildings for schools have provided technical resources to build healthy, efficient schools. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 directs DOE to review existing programs and initiatives across the federal government and to give states and local education agencies technical assistance for boosting energy efficiency. DOE is developing an Efficient and Healthy Schools Campaign to advise schools on how to improve ventilation as part of broader retrofits that save energy and improve indoor air quality.
— Create and leverage other funding sources on efficiency and resilience. The $190.5 billion federal relief funds consist of $13.5 billion from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, $54.3 billion from the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSA), and $122.7 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act. While schools can use these funds to upgrade HVAC systems that improve ventilation, many schools will likely spend them on other priorities, such as hiring teachers.
In an interview with The New York Times, Dr. Perrigan, the superintendent of a rural Virginia school district and the president of a school coalition, emphasized that improving school facilities would have a lasting impact on their communities for generations to come. Unfortunately, the schools are deterred from using the funds as a down payment on long-term capital improvements, because the funds must be spent by 2025.
More federal funding dedicated to improving school efficiency and resilience is needed. Senator Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., recently introduced the Resilient Schools Act of 2021 to provide $40 billion to promote climate resilience, with energy efficiency as a critical component. Rep. Bowman, a former school principal, also proposed the Green New Deal for Public Schools Act that would, among other things, retrofit every public school building to remove asbestos, increase energy efficiency, and install renewable energy on-site or procure clean energy.
Utilities and other local sources should leverage their funding to bolster the federal programs. For example, the Tennessee Valley Authority has launched a School Uplift program to invest $7.3 million over the next three years to help 160 public schools in seven states upgrade aging facilities.
Public–private partnership is essential to transform K-12 public schools in the next decade. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic has started to recede in some parts of the U.S., we need an all-hands-on-deck approach to develop a short-term plan that helps schools reopen quickly and safely and supports long-term goals that modernize school facilities and provide every American child with a healthy, efficient, and resilient learning environment.

Energy Department’s Showerhead Plan Would Fix Loophole;"Washington, DC — A proposed rule announced by the Department of Energy (DOE) today would undo a loophole created by the previous administration and ensure showerheads do not needlessly use more water than Congress directed nearly three decades ago. To date, few manufacturers have chosen to produce products that exploit the loophole, but such showerheads could waste water at a time when much of the western United States is in drought.
Congress set a standard in 1992 limiting showerheads to spraying 2.5 gallons of water per minute, helping reduce the strain on water supplies and cut energy use from water heating. Manufacturers subsequently improved their models; today’s highest-rated fixtures use significantly less water than the standard allows, and researchers have found no significant impact on user satisfaction from some models that do so (nine states or jurisdictions have standards that are stronger than the 1992 standard).
But in December 2020, following comments by the then-president concerning showerheads, DOE issued a final rule allowing models with an unlimited number of nozzles that each could use 2.5 gallons of water per minute.
“People aren’t clamoring for these things, and the department is right to close the loophole,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “They should get this one finished and move quickly on setting standards for products that are overdue for updates.”
Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), said, “It’s a good and necessary step. At a time when a good portion of the country is experiencing serious drought exacerbated by climate change, there’s no place for showerheads that use needless amounts of water.”
Only a handful of models available for sale today through major online retailers appear to potentially exploit the current loophole and feature multiple nozzles that together may exceed 2.5-gallons-per-minute.
At the time of President Biden’s inauguration, DOE had missed 28 legal deadlines for reviewing efficiency standards for products ranging from refrigerators to room air conditioners, and the agency has yet to complete a review of any of them. Many more are coming due in the years ahead.
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), a nonprofit research organization, develops policies to reduce energy waste and combat climate change. Its independent analysis advances investments, programs, and behaviors that use energy more effectively and help build an equitable clean energy future. 
The Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) organizes and leads a broad-based coalition effort that works to advance, win and defend new appliance, equipment and lighting standards which deliver large energy and water savings, monetary savings and environmental benefits.

U.S. Can Cut Emissions by Helping Transform Industrial Clusters;"As the Biden administration seeks to cut climate-warming emissions from industry, it needs to provide support for an approach that is showing promise in the United States and abroad: clusters of industrial companies.
These clusters—concentrations of companies providing specialized goods or services—offer a unique and powerful approach to developing and deploying low-carbon infrastructure. They can promote both competition and cooperation that spur companies to operate more productively in sourcing materials, accessing utilities (e.g., water, power), and advancing technology. Research Triangle Park, for example, is a cluster in North Carolina where the leveraged learning of co-located companies and three nearby universities has led to rapid advancements in biotech and pharmaceuticals expertise and capabilities.  
Clusters of companies are also starting to collaborate on the path to step-change reductions in greenhouse gases (GHGs), which is important because industry accounts for more than one-fourth of U.S. GHGs. To spur the growth of these clusters and capture their full potential, government must play a role.
To that end, ACEEE is proposing (thanks to input from more than 60 organizations across industry, labor, and NGOs) a new Department of Energy program to advance industrial clusters and create jobs. In our Innovation and Competitiveness at Industrial Clusters proposal, DOE would use a competitive bidding process to strengthen clusters that have strategic plans to pursue low-carbon technology, improve supply chain agility, increase efficiency and resilience, train workers, and reduce environmental impacts in surrounding communities.
We see industrial clusters as a linchpin for rapidly reducing harmful (GHG and chemical) emissions. Single companies acting alone cannot pull off the swift transformation needed to slash emissions in industry, which is particularly challenging to decarbonize. Companies will need to collaborate.
Clusters: A Proven Approach
Companies have been clustering in the United States for centuries, often to capitalize on complementary resources, transportation, proximity to customers, and a skilled pool of workers. For example, California's wine cluster takes advantage of industries that support grape growing and wine making and of local universities' viticulture programs. In Silicon Valley, a specialized workforce in information technology drives innovation. On the Gulf Coast, petrochemical clusters have ready access to a specialized workforce, relatively low-cost energy and feedstocks, and transportation.
Clusters can be geographically concentrated, but they do not have to be. In Europe, they are considered key actors across specialized industries, and they aim to improve competitiveness and lower emissions across entire value chains.
Clusters can account for a large portion of emissions, waste, and water use in many sectors. For example, in Europe, some 3,000 industrial clusters account for 20% of the continent’s GHG emissions, not including transportation. Local communities and those downwind can be affected by these environmental impacts, which disproportionately hurt low-income communities. This pollution raises serious environmental justice and equity concerns. Clusters need to exert leadership to address challenges and opportunities in parallel. 
The good news: clusters’ sizeable energy use can provide a large customer base for low-carbon electric technologies (supplied by renewable electricity). In the United States, for example, the Port of Los Angeles recently debuted hydrogen-powered electric vehicles (trucks, forklifts) as part of its $82.5 million near-zero emissions freight facilities initiative. Similarly, the potential for Houston’s Hydrogen Cluster to serve as a launching pad for a low-carbon hydrogen industry was recently highlighted, along with the need for innovation, market transformation, and a targeted policy and funding approach.    
Cluster Innovation in the U.S. and Abroad
Innovation is also occurring abroad. For example, the Suzhou Industrial Park in China targets by-product circularity, a distributed clean energy microgrid, and other approaches to be carbon neutral by 2050. In the Netherlands, the Port of Rotterdam has gathered cluster partners to develop one project to transport industrial carbon dioxide to offshore empty gas fields (Porthos) and another project (HyTransPort) to make the port the backbone of hydrogen infrastructure in northern Europe. And in Germany, the Get H2 consortium aims to transport low-carbon hydrogen to the country’s industrial heartland, starting with a former natural gas pipeline, so it can be used in steel, chemicals, and refinery clusters.
To address hard-to-abate CO2 sources, Valero has proposed capture, transport, reuse, and storage of CO2 from clusters of ethanol and other industrial facilities in the U.S. Midwest. In the United Kingdom, at the Humber cluster, 12 entities are collaborating to generate green hydrogen from offshore wind to power facilities. 
Innovation will be necessary to effectively implement such technologies, improve efficiency, and recast multiple supply chains. California highlighted six cluster areas for an Innovation Hub Initiative, and North Carolina (e.g., Research Triangle Park mentioned earlier) seeks to strengthen innovation-related activities across business, universities, workforce agencies, and government.
Clusters as Job Creators
Decarbonizing industrial clusters could be a big job creator. New Jersey recognizes in its State Strategic Plan that industrial clusters account for 46% of employment and 60% of wages in the state. In the European Union, clusters that use hydrogen could create 900,000 jobs. The European Commission established the Cluster Collaboration Platform to aid the transformation to a low-carbon economy as part of the 100 billion (EUR)—or $118.6B (USD)—Horizon fund.  
However, to rapidly pursue transformative technology, companies need help to take on enormous investments and risks. For example, a single direct reduction iron plant and a large demonstration CCUS (carbon capture, utilization and storage) facility both cost approximately $1 billion.  A recent case study examining the prospect of a net-zero hub in the Houston area estimated infrastructure costs of $28 billion to reduce 25 million tons of CO2 per year. It concluded that substantial public policy support would be needed to attract private investment. 
Companies cannot address this transformation by themselves or even with extensive partnerships because of the upfront costs with no or low near-term economic returns, the exceptionally high technical risks, the accelerated timeframe, and innumerable uncertainties.
Federal policymakers need to help with investments that support technology demonstration and speed its commercialization. By stepping up and establishing a dedicated DOE program, they can spur collaboration in industrial clusters.  The future depends on it.

EPA Can Maximize Fuel Savings of Partially Automated Vehicles;"The term “autonomous vehicle” (AV) evokes the idea of fully self-driving cars that let humans completely disengage from the act of driving. But this ignores what is actually happening on the road today, where cars with some computer-controlled driving abilities are becoming commonplace. These vehicles have the potential to improve fuel economy, but that opportunity will depend on the actions of federal regulators, according to a new ACEEE white paper.
Our paper, Near-Term Impacts of Automated Vehicle Technologies, points to research showing that the partially automated cars on the road today—or likely to be developed and sold in the next 10 years—could have a wide range of possible impacts on individual vehicle fuel economy, either increasing it by up to 46% or actually decreasing it by up to 14%, compared to vehicles with purely human drivers. The paper investigates the near-term potential fuel economy impacts of automated vehicles, the gaps in the current federal fuel economy program’s treatment of these vehicles, and how the EPA might begin to fill in those gaps to guide the AV market toward better fuel efficiency.
Partially automated cars—those with cruise control (CC), adaptive cruise control (ACC), lane keeping assistance (LKA), and other features—are already a significant part of the market and continue to grow in both market share and complexity. Vehicles equipped with both ACC and LKA systems, which can function together, grew from 2% to 10% of new car sales from 2018 to 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, 26% of new cars delivered to dealerships were equipped with either ACC, where computers can control vehicle acceleration, or LKA, where computers can control vehicle steering, both under supervision and in limited traffic conditions. The fuel efficiency impacts of these partially automated vehicles are too large to continue to ignore.
Many drivers know that the way they drive can affect fuel economy. The same is true for computer-controlled and partially computer-controlled vehicles. The fuel economy impacts of ACC systems, for example, depend on the automakers’ design choices.
Yet AV technology’s impact on efficiency is not reflected in the fuel economy sticker that buyers see on the car, nor in the fuel economy standards that automakers must meet. Vehicle fuel economy is tested on dynamometers, essentially large treadmills, where vehicles must drive at preset speed cycles at all times. Automakers’ decisions about how their vehicles’ automated features change vehicle movement are excluded, by design, from the testing process. While there is an EPA program to reward automakers for fuel economy improvements that are not captured during the preset cycles on the dynamometer, such as more-efficient climate control systems, this “off-cycle” credit program is costly, time consuming for both automakers and the EPA, and not currently equipped to handle the coming growth in variety and complexity of automated vehicle systems.
To encourage automakers to design AVs that improve fuel efficiency, a good place to start is updating test protocols to detect and quantify such improvements. ACEEE’s new white paper recommends that EPA do the following:
Sort automated vehicle features into discrete groups based on capabilities. For example, systems that work only on freeways and combine both LKA and ACC would be treated the same.
Not allow AV features primarily designed to improve safety, such as automatic emergency braking, to earn off-cycle credits.
Design test protocols for each eligible group of AV features.
Design test protocols for features that are already market available or expected to be sold within 3 years.
Award credits based on how often AV features are actually used. EPA should estimate this value and use real-world data for AV features that have already been introduced into the market. These data and usage estimates should be updated regularly, and credits for future model years should be based upon the most recent data usage estimates.
These recommendations can be adapted into the off-cycle credit program without changes to required testing procedures. Therefore, over the short term, EPA should allow credits to be earned in this process on a voluntary basis. As the market for AVs grows, EPA should consider changing the required fuel economy testing procedures, mandate AV tests, and impose penalties for AV implementations found to decrease fuel economy.
If we fail to guide AVs toward better fuel efficiency, we may not only miss out on opportunities to increase fuel economy, but actually see fuel economy decrease, oil consumption increase, and air pollution worsen as a by-product of the deployment of AV technologies. These problems may be exacerbated by less direct impacts of vehicle automation, such as increased tolerance for long commutes or changes in traffic patterns, though such indirect impacts were beyond the scope of this paper.

How Much Can Industry Decarbonize? Summer Study Author Discusses EPA’s New Estimate;"With industry accounting for more than 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, its decarbonization will be crucial for meeting U.S. climate goals. Yet industry is not as easy to electrify as other parts of the U.S. economy, because some of its processes require higher temperatures than electric heat pumps can currently handle. So, how much and how quickly can industry really decarbonize?
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers an estimate in a paper to be presented at next month’s biennial Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry. The EPA analysis is one of more than four dozen papers that this 14th biennial event, hosted virtually this year, will publish on technologies, policies, and programs to reduce industry’s energy use and emissions.

“This analysis shows that many different approaches are needed to achieve deep decarbonization by 2050,” says Elizabeth Dutrow, the founding manager of EPA’s ENERGY STAR Industrial Partnerships, former Summer Study panel leader, and long-time conference contributor. “Industry needs to start now,” she adds. Dutrow co-authored the paper with Gale Boyd of Duke University, Josh Smith of consulting firm ICF, and Ernst Worrell of Utrecht University — all long-time conference contributors.
The authors estimate the potential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. manufacturing overall and in the seven most carbon- and energy-intensive industries. They used the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook as their Reference Case forecast of industrial activity and combined it with a review of literature on industrial emissions technologies and practices.   
I reached out to Dutrow to get a preview of their findings. Here are excerpts of our conversation:
In EPA's assessment, how much industrial decarbonization is possible by 2050?
Our evaluation estimates a reduction potential of 86% from EIA’s estimated level of industrial emissions in 2050. While we did not evaluate the timing of specific actions between now and 2050, there are logical time periods for certain activities. For example, energy efficiency is important now and into the future, whereas electrification will depend on appropriate pricing and a decarbonized grid.  
Which pillars or areas deliver the biggest carbon reductions?
We looked at four pillars of deep decarbonization of manufacturing or DDM, as shown in the figure below:
energy efficiency.
material efficiency (structural changes in manufacturing such as product recycling and reuse, material substitution, and demand reduction).
industry-specific technology (e.g., carbon capture, storage, and utilization; hydrogen; and non-power generation renewables).
power-grid synergies (shift to a zero-carbon grid and beneficial electrification of fuel-consuming processes). 
No single pillar dominates deep decarbonization across all industrial sectors. Among the pillars examined, energy efficiency’s contribution is the largest (34%), followed by power grid synergies (30%), material efficiency (22%), and industry-specific technologies (14%).
The evaluation shows that energy efficiency has been and will continue to be an important strategy going forward, as it not only impacts emissions, but will provide savings and reductions that prepare the way for the remaining pillars to be more attainable. New energy efficiency opportunities include improved plant component design, increased optimization of production processes, enhanced waste heat recovery, etc.   
  What are the biggest obstacles to reaching this 86% reduction by 2050? 
There are many. Obviously, ready-to-deploy technology and available funding are important. Broadly, though, decarbonization of all of industry must be a goal and high priority. Our evaluation shows that a handful of energy intensive sectors (e.g., iron and steel, chemicals, cement, shown in the figure below) have multiple opportunities to decarbonize significantly by 2050. However, the remainder of industry, a group of sectors we labeled “light industry” could provide 39% of the decarbonization in 2050. 
Light industry includes manufacturing sites that produce items from baked bread to vehicles to cast metal parts, and these businesses range from large to small in size. Light industry tends to rely on electricity and natural gas to power operations. With a decarbonized grid, it is easy to imagine the carbon emissions prevented as a fully energy-efficient, light industrial sector draws from that grid. But, to get there by 2050, disincentives such as inexpensive natural gas and lack of supporting infrastructure need to be addressed. Finally, we believe light industry is in a good position to make use of renewable energy as the process temperature needs often are much lower than the energy-intensive sectors.  
  What needs to happen now to overcome the obstacles and rapidly decarbonize? 
Decarbonization of the industrial sector needs to grow extensively to take advantage of the time available and the savings that energy efficiency provides to help fund action among all of the pillars. Industrial decarbonization should be approached with the view that all available options are necessary. Certain opportunities reduce the cost of others, while some reduce emissions to a more manageable size so that new technologies can play their important role. Finally, while many companies are setting long-term carbon reduction goals, they also need to commit funds to meeting their decarbonization targets.

As U.S. Decarbonizes, Here’s How to Meet Energy Needs in Seven Challenging Sectors;"Electricity can provide energy for most U.S. applications by the 2040s, but it will likely not be able to meet all needs in certain sectors, particularly for high-temperature industrial processes and long-distance airplanes, according to an ACEEE analysis that estimates the need for alternate fuel sources for seven applications.  
As the U.S. moves toward decarbonizing its economy, these alternative fuels will need to have net-zero carbon emissions. Examples include fuels derived from biomass, hydrogen produced with zero-emission electricity (e.g., renewable energy, nuclear), and synthetic fuels. We present our analysis, which follows our prior look at electrification’s large opportunities in three sectors, to further discussions on strategies to fully decarbonize all U.S. energy use.
Our new analysis finds a need for about 9 quadrillion Btu (quads) of fuels in 2040, which is less than 10% of total current U.S. energy use. Our estimates are highly approximate and are illustrated in the chart below and detailed at the end of this blog post.

The role of energy efficiency
For most fuel uses, electric vehicles and heat pumps are more efficient than conventional vehicles and heating systems. Thus, electrification, done right, is a form of energy efficiency. Efficiency can play a large role in reducing the amount of energy we need. It can include a broad array of measures, ranging from better-weatherized buildings that need less heat to better-optimized industrial processes.
Our analysis of fuel needs is based on projected U.S. energy use in 2040 in the Reference Case of the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA’s) Annual Energy Outlook, which includes only a moderate amount of efficiency. In the sections below, we discuss fuel needs for each of the sectors shown in the pie chart and also note additional opportunities for energy efficiency.
Industrial processes
Industry uses heat for melting, drying, and aiding chemical transformations. Heat pumps can provide much of this heat, but they cannot handle applications that require particularly high temperatures. Zuhldorf finds that industrial heat pumps might be able to serve processes needing temperatures as high as 280° C (526 F), but McMillan estimates that about 30% of industrial heating needs exceed that.
These higher temperature loads will require about 3.3 quadrillion Btu of energy (“quads”) in 2040 in the EIA reference case. This fuel need can be reduced by implementing efficiency measures ranging from reducing steam leaks, to improved industrial processes that use no or less high-temperature steam (e.g., infrared heating, ultraviolet curing), to changing to products that need less heat (e.g., substituting engineered lumber for steel where possible).
Industry is often located in clusters; in many cases, the fuel needed can be provided by hydrogen from regional hydrogen networks. Presently, such a network exists in Louisiana and Texas, and expansion has been proposed for Houston. However, this hydrogen is presently produced from natural gas, and in the long term. this will largely need to be converted to electrolysis using carbon-free electricity.
This discussion covers only fuels that are burned and does not include hydrocarbons that are used as raw materials to produce such goods as plastics and many chemicals, because in these other applications, the carbon is commonly incorporated into products and not released into the air.
Airplanes
Air travel is a major energy use and is projected to continue growing. Electric planes are being developed and perhaps can cover trips up to about 500 miles. Beyond that, the weight of the batteries substantially restricts the size of loads, although electric motors can continue to be used as part of hybrid electric/fuel aircraft (see here). Data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics indicate that in the first two months of 2021, 87% of U.S. flight miles were on flights of more than 500 miles.
These longer flights will require about 3.2 quads of energy in 2040 in the EIA reference case. More-efficient engines and airframes, operational improvements, and changes in travel can reduce this further; Greene and Plotkin estimate 32% potential savings by 2035. In the longer run, remaining energy could perhaps come from hydrogen (e.g., Airbus is developing several hydrogen-fueled planes). In the nearer term, biofuels and synthetic fuels might be used.
Ships
Ships often travel long distances. While electricity can be used for short trips (e.g., an electric container ship is now operating in Norway), as with planes, the weight of batteries impinges on the amount of cargo that can be carried. Smil discusses some of the issues involved. We estimate that fuels might be needed for as much as 90% of shipping, which would require about 0.9 quads of energy in 2040 for U.S. domestic shipping plus fuel provided in U.S. ports for international shipping. Again, efficiency can be improved; the International Maritime Organization now requires that new ships be designed to meet Energy Efficiency Design Index requirements, which look at both energy use and carbon emissions. To supply this energy, alternative fuels are being explored, including biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, hydrogen, and synthetic fuels.
Long-distance trucks
A recent ACEEE report finds that electric trucks can serve most trucking needs. The exception is for long-distance runs of more than 500 miles. Beyond about 500 miles, the cost and weight of additional batteries will generally make fuel cell trucks a better option. Electric trucks and buses are already available for purchase; tractor-trailers that can go long distances on a single charge are scheduled for sale later this year (including one with a 500-mile range). To maximize range, a variety of efficiency improvements are being included; operational improvements, such as those enabled by information and communication technologies, can improve efficiency further (as will be shown in a forthcoming ACEEE white paper). Fuel cell trucks using hydrogen are also being developed. Census data indicate that about 13% of heavy-truck miles are in trips of 500 miles or more. If these trips use hydrogen, about 0.7 quads of fuel will be needed in 2040.
Buildings on very cold days
Previous ACEEE research found that cold-climate heat pumps can supply heat in very cold weather (down to about 5° F [-15 C] and sometimes lower). New highly efficient homes can function with minimal back-up electric resistance heat. For example, Efficiency Vermont has worked on projects that function down to -25°F with only a small electric heating coil.
However, it is difficult to make an existing house that efficient. Field studies by the Center for Energy and the Environment found that in metro Minneapolis, cold-climate heat pumps can reduce winter energy use by 65% on average, with the remaining energy coming from a backup gas furnace. While backup electric resistance heat can be used, in cold climates this would often require extensive and expensive grid upgrades; backup fuel-based heating may be a better option.
EIA’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey estimates that 60% of U.S. residential heating is in cold climates (shown in the map below). If we assume that existing homes in cold climates need some type of fuel backup, accounting for 20% of their heating demand (allowing for the fact that Minnesota is colder than the cold climate average), then 0.5 quads of fuels will be needed for residential heating. While some homes may need fuels for water heating and other end-uses, energy efficiency home upgrades can substantially reduce the amount of fuel needed for space heating.

To serve these fuel needs, what the gas industry calls renewable natural gas (RNG — biofuel that has been refined to be similar to natural gas) is perhaps the most likely solution, but hydrogen is another option. In dense areas such as cities, these fuels can often be provided via gas distribution networks, either existing networks for RNG, or new networks for hydrogen (because current networks are generally too leaky to accommodate hydrogen). This fuel would be used only on the coldest days of the year, and therefore more analysis is needed on the economics of maintaining gas distribution networks for use on only cold days. In areas where maintaining distribution networks is not feasible, bottled compressed RNG might be used; because the fuel will be rarely used, tanks might require only annual refills. 
Similarly, in the commercial sector, several projects using large-scale heat pumps illustrate the usefulness of a fuel backup for cold days. A recent ACEEE study on electrifying commercial buildings notes several examples of projects where heat pumps supply about 90% of heat, with the remainder from gas. If we assume this 10% applies on average to U.S. commercial space heating (plus some other uses, minus efficiency savings), about 0.2 quads of fuel will be needed. This fuel will be supplied in ways similar to in the residential sector, but larger commercial buildings are more likely to use piped gas.
Railroads
Some U.S. railroads are electrified, most are not. One analysis estimates that 15-30% of U.S. rail lines can be electrified cost effectively. If we take the midpoint of this range and apply it to railroad energy use in the EIA reference case, we will need about 0.4 quads of fuel. Greene and Plotkin discuss a variety of ways to reduce train energy use, including more-efficient engines, hybrid engines (similar to a hybrid car), regenerative braking, reducing mass of railcars, and improved operations and maintenance. Decarbonized fuel to serve remaining loads might include hydrogen (e.g., General Motors and Wabtec Locomotives just announced a fuel cell engine partnership) as well as many of the fuel options discussed above for shipping.
Conclusion
The numbers discussed in this blog post are highly approximate – we welcome feedback on them. Ultimately, electricity can serve most loads, but some fuel will also be needed. Energy efficiency can reduce the amount of fuel and electricity needed. The end-uses needing the most attention to develop carbon-free fuels are high-temperature industrial processes, airplanes, ships, and long-distance trucks.

"Manufacturers Use Games to Save Energy; Summer Study Speaker Explains How";"What’s an innovative way to save energy? In recent years, as ACEEE has found, utilities have developed all sorts of games and competitions that motivate homeowners and other people to reduce their energy use. An upcoming analysis highlights how manufacturers are also using gamification as one way to crowdsource energy savings.
This paper will be one of more than four dozen presented at the 14th biennial Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry next month. This weeklong virtual event will explore the latest technologies, policies, and programs for reducing energy waste and decarbonizing industry, which accounts for more than one-fourth of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
REGISTER FOR SUMMER STUDY
“The ACEEE Summer Study is itself an example of crowdsourcing energy efficiency solutions,” says Clifton Yin, a senior energy and sustainability analyst at consulting firm ICF and co-author of the new gamification paper with ICF colleagues Mitch Brown and Jesse Gubert. Yin adds, “We’re looking forward to learning, networking, and sharing ideas.”
To see how gamification (turning a real-world activity into a game) and crowdsourcing could be used across the industrial sector, the authors studied the approaches of four manufacturers participating in the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Better Plants program: ArcelorMittal USA (acquired by Cleveland Cliffs last year), Celanese Corporation, Legrand North America, and Saint-Gobain Corporation. At one of our Summer Study plenaries, Cleveland Cliffs’ CEO Lourenco Goncalves will discuss the company’s approach to decarbonization.
To learn more about the paper’s findings, I asked Yin a few questions. Here’s a sneak peek with excerpts of our conversation:
Why are manufacturers using gamification and crowdsourcing to save energy?
Crowdsourcing and gamification increase employee engagement and empower employees to implement technology and process changes while reshaping their own energy usage behaviors. They also provide companies with creative and fun options to increase energy efficiency at the facility level beyond just traditional capital projects. There’s science behind it; games have been proven to promote teamwork and problem solving, while crowdsourcing is effective at gathering new ideas and fostering a more inclusive culture that improves morale and helps achieve energy saving goals.
Can you give us some examples of how manufacturers are doing this? 
ArcelorMittal hosted a Power of 1 contest to encourage employees to develop energy cost savings ideas, while Celanese crowdsourced “Did You Know”-type energy efficiency fact sheets through an initiative called “Energy Sparks.” “Energy Marathons,” a competition among five-person employee teams across the company to improve compressed air efficiency. Compress It,” a competition between five-person employee teams across the company to improve compressed air efficiency.
How much energy did one of these companies save?
Legrand has saved over 1.8 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) and $185,000 in energy costs over the course of three Energy Marathons. Another goal of the Energy Marathon is to encourage sites and employees to share and adopt long-term energy-saving habits that will last well beyond the 26.2 days of the competition. To find new opportunities, Legrand paired new and old sites as a team and tied the progress for both buildings together.
How can other companies optimize these approaches?
There’s a wealth of crowdsourcing and gamification examples in both the public and private sectors, but not a whole lot of set guidelines and best practices. Our paper aims to help companies structure these types of initiatives by applying John P. Kotter’s 8-step change model, a popular framework for successfully implementing organizational change. The steps Kotter identified to successfully implement organizational change are: 1. Establishing a sense of urgency; 2. Creating the guiding coalition; 3. Developing a vision and strategy; 4. Communicating the change vision; 5. Empowering employees for broad-based action; 6. Generating short-term wins; 7. Consolidating gains and producing more change; and 8. Anchoring new approaches in the culture.
By 2030, how widely do you expect companies will use gamification and crowdsourcing to save energy?
The approaches have become more mainstream as manufacturers broaden the scope of their energy management initiatives and build more energy-focused company cultures. In addition to the Better Plants case studies from ArcelorMittal, Celanese, Legrand, and Saint-Gobain, our paper cites examples from IBM and Xerox, and there are additional examples from 3M, Armstrong Flooring, and more. We expect an increasing number of companies will be taking advantage of these strategies to engage employees and improve energy efficiency by 2030.

Analysis: Outdated U.S. Lending Rules Abet Inefficient Homes, High Energy Bills, Climate Change;"Groups Call on HUD, USDA, VA to Update Standards to Cut Costs and Carbon Emissions, Create Jobs
  Washington, DC—Hundreds of thousands of new homes purchased each year with federally backed loans and programs are built to outdated energy efficiency standards, saddling low- and moderate-income households with needless energy costs and raising greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new analysis released today. Other new homes backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have no limit on energy waste. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) found that if regulators regularly update efficiency requirements for the homes, they can create one million job-years of work, reduce total costs by $29 billion, and avert carbon pollution equivalent to that from 67 million passenger vehicles in a year.
In a letter dated Thursday, 18 energy efficiency organizations and associations called on Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia Fudge and Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack to move quickly to update the standards to ensure new homes are far more energy efficient.
“It just doesn’t make sense for the government to be funding new houses that are inefficient and come with higher energy costs, while causing more emissions,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of ACEEE. “Congress required that these homes be efficient, but the regulators haven’t kept up. We could see a big win for the climate if HUD and USDA follow the law and get these criteria updated to today’s best practices.”
Updating the standards to match new model codes would ensure that the new homes have more insulation, are less drafty, have better lighting, and perhaps have far more efficient water heaters or use heat pumps. ACEEE found that homes built each year to outdated criteria will cost owners and renters an extra $1.1 billion, emit 6 million metric tons of unnecessary CO2, and reduce employment by 18,000 job-years.
Congress directed regulators to periodically update standards for new homes purchased with the support of federally backed mortgages and federal housing programs to ensure that they do not burden residents with high energy costs. The requirements, included in bipartisan legislation passed in 1992 and revised in 2007, cover new homes purchased with loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), USDA loans, and HUD housing programs; there also is a requirement for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans. These loans and programs are primarily designed for low- and moderate-income borrowers and renters, and together they cover roughly 18% of new single-family homes and multifamily units, or 228,000 homes each year. The current efficiency criteria for most of the homes at issue, set in 2015, are based on model building codes from 2009 and 2007.
The law requires the agencies to update the criteria to the newest model building codes upon a determination that doing so would not negatively affect the availability or affordability of covered housing. ACEEE’s new analysis—based in part on federal data—provides answers. It finds that moving to the new code would yield net positive cash flow (the energy bill savings minus the added monthly mortgage payments will pay back the initial expense of a 10% down payment) in 17 months for an average single-family home and 26 months for multifamily building units.
The administration’s first regulatory agenda, issued this month to list pending and upcoming rulemakings, did not include the needed HUD and USDA determination, but HUD has indicated the process has started.
The ACEEE analysis finds an even larger opportunity in potential efficiency requirements for the nearly 50% of new home mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. These “government-sponsored enterprises” (GSEs) are supervised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), an independent agency. Guided by FHFA and by their “duty to serve” low- and moderate-income borrowers and renters, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac set requirements for homes covered by these mortgages, but not currently energy criteria. If FHFA or the GSEs require these homes to meet up-to-date energy codes, the benefits in terms of financial savings and emissions reductions will more than triple.

As Utilities Plan New Power Plants, Analysis Shows Saving Energy Is a Low-Cost Alternative;"Utility decisions about how to meet their customers’ power needs can have far-reaching consequences. At a time when the Biden administration aims to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, utilities in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and other states are set to switch on more than 6.6 GW of new natural gas power plants this year that will generate heat-trapping emissions for decades to come.
What if there were an alternative? A new ACEEE policy brief, published today, shows that utilities needing to meet increased electric demand or replace old power plants could often save costs by investing in energy efficiency improvements in the homes and businesses they serve, rather than building new plants. In fact, these energy efficiency measures should be the first option utilities consider to provide low-cost energy solutions.
Our new research, based on data from 48 of the largest electric utilities in the United States, shows that the cheapest kilowatt-hour is frequently the one not used. We looked at the levelized cost of efficiency programs—the up-front cost of incentivizing efficiency improvements in homes and businesses, divided across the total number of years the efficiency upgrades will last. This allowed us to see how these programs compare in price, on a watt-for-watt basis, with different options for generating energy.
Source data: ACEEE Utility Scorecard 2020, Lazard 2020.
Our analysis found that energy efficiency, with an average cost of just $24 per saved megawatt-hour, is still one of the least-cost options for a utility looking to meet its resource needs. And thanks to the falling costs of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, utilities in today’s power grid system have a wide variety of carbon-free alternatives to building new fossil fuel plants. In fact, energy efficiency’s low cost makes it so that other carbon-free resources, including renewable energy  and energy storage, are more competitive with the costs of most new power plants when optimized with efficiency and demand flexibility in a portfolio of assets. This makes a transition to a decarbonized power grid more straightforward than ever before.
So, why are utilities continuing to propose new fossil fuel plants? The answer to that is complicated, but there is a simple reason why many utilities don’t think of efficiency first when it comes to meeting their customer’s energy needs. Under the traditional utility business model, investor-owned utilities are incentivized to make money by increasing sales and building new power plants. Without reform, this means that utilities lose profits if they invest in efficiency for their customers. Utilities will need to modernize their role in the power grid system to take full advantage of the benefits these distributed energy resources (DERs) can provide. The benefits that efficiency and other DERs include reducing pollution, improving system reliability, and delivering more affordable power and equity of access for disadvantaged groups, especially households facing high energy burdens.
Some states are already taking steps toward this goal by reforming the utility business model to encourage investor-owned utilities to invest in energy efficiency and setting Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS) targets to achieve minimum levels of energy efficiency savings. But across 50 states, this approach is far from consistent. Leadership from state public utility commissions and legislatures is vital to make sure that utilities are making the right kinds of decisions that align with climate-forward goals.
The true value of efficiency
Although knowing the cost of saving energy is useful as a point of comparison with power plants and other supply-side resources, on its own it does not fully illustrate the value that efficiency brings. A saved kilowatt-hour also comes with additional non-energy benefits, like avoiding environmental costs from fossil fueled power plants, improving indoor air quality and health, creating local jobs and stimulating economic growth, boosting system reliability and resilience in the face of severe weather, and more. These many benefits are why state commissions need robust cost-effectiveness testing that accounts for non-energy factors to get a complete picture of efficiency that looks beyond just dollars and cents.
As utilities across the country create plans to address climate change, scaling up energy efficiency through policies like EERS and utility business model reform will be crucial for providing every household, business, and industry in America with affordable, clean power.

Energy-Saving Infrastructure Investments Could Boost Jobs by 400,000 for Years;"Proposals Could Cut Greenhouse Gasses by Amount Equal to Nine Months of U.S. Emissions
  Washington, DC—A package of proposed energy-saving investments in the nation’s buildings, transportation, and industrial sector would boost jobs by about 400,000 for several years and cut greenhouse gas emissions by an amount equal to nine months of all current U.S. emissions, a new analysis released today finds. The study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) models the impacts of 10 sets of proposals, several touted by the Biden administration or congressional leaders, that a major infrastructure or other funding bill could include this year.
Among the measures analyzed are funds for efficiency upgrades to affordable homes, tax breaks to encourage purchases of efficient electric vehicles and heat pumps, and programs to transform industrial energy use. Together, over the lifetime of the investments and their impacts, the 10 proposals would:
Create 3.9 million jobs over time (measured in job-years), with about 400,000 jobs added for several years this decade.
Reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 3.7 billion tons
Save households and businesses $300 billion on energy bills
“These energy-saving investments create jobs now, reduce energy costs for years to come, and protect our climate,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of ACEEE. “The decisions our leaders make now are going to affect a whole generation of buildings, vehicles, and industrial plants. We have an opportunity to make transformative investments in our future, and we should seize it.”
The most transformational long-term market impacts of the policies examined would come from support for transformative industrial technologies, large-scale commercialization of efficient electric heat pumps for space and water heating, and new zero-energy homes and commercial buildings. Efficiency improvements in low-income homes, including in affordable rental housing, would reduce energy costs for those who need it most while improving the comfort and safety of residences.
The ACEEE analysis focused on 10 proposals for federal energy efficiency investments—some introduced in Congress and some with multiple components—that could be included in major infrastructure legislation. The projections are based on likely scenarios for implementation compared to a baseline scenario without the funding, not on maximum potential impacts. The jobs are net added employment after paying for the investments, and the carbon reduction is based on projected average carbon intensity of electricity. The analysis includes a breakdown of the jobs created, carbon dioxide emissions avoided, and net economic savings from each set of proposals evaluated, including the potential impacts of larger and smaller investment levels.

Cities, States Can Make Homes Healthier and Cut Energy Bills with COVID Relief Funds;"Communities across the United States may soon be able to invest federal relief funds in energy-saving measures to create local jobs, reduce energy costs, and improve home health. For governments seeking to address the economic hardships and social disparities exacerbated by the pandemic, it could be an important opportunity to invest in people, housing, and the environment. At stake is $350 billion from the American Rescue Plan dedicated for state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments to invest in an equitable recovery.
The Treasury Department, while launching the program last month, specified how these governments may use the funding, including to replace lost revenue and revitalize government services, invest in certain types of infrastructure, support public health, and address economic harms from the pandemic.
The guidelines explicitly name climate resilience and responding to climate impacts as goals and potential uses of these funds. Energy efficiency measures, which can reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050, certainly fit that bill. Further, they give these governments across the country the opportunity to reduce systemic inequities in their communities.
Smaller municipalities, generally with populations of 50,000 or less, are now coordinating with their state budget offices to receive their initial funding allocation. Larger cities and states request their funding directly from the federal government. Let’s take a deeper look at how Treasury has specified governments use funding—and where this presents opportunities for energy efficiency investments.
Potential uses for American Rescue Plan funds
Address economic challenges and disparities exacerbated by the pandemic  
These federal relief funds can be used to “address negative economic impacts caused by the public health emergency, including economic harms to workers, households, small businesses, impacted industries, and the public sector.” Energy efficiency programs can reduce energy costs for families with low incomes and communities of color. Compared to white (non-Hispanic) households, Black households spend 43% more of their income on energy costs, Hispanic households spend 20% more, and Native American households spend 45% more. Households with low incomes (those with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level) spend three times more of their income on energy costs than households with higher incomes.
These groups are also experiencing the severe economic impacts of the pandemic. Weatherization efforts can reduce utility bills and improve health and safety of occupants by improving air quality, which can provide relief to communities facing economic challenges that have been magnified by COVID-19 through job loss and health challenges. Nearly 30% of households have income eligibility for home weatherization assistance funded by the government, as of 2019, yet only a tiny share of them receive improvements because the program is so underfunded. 
Minneapolis shows how cities can structure their relief efforts, including efficiency investments, to help marginalized communities and advance more-equitable outcomes. The city’s Green Zones Initiative, created in 2017, designates two priority areas in Minneapolis identified to be facing high exposure to pollution and to be economically vulnerable. The city dedicates funding for sustainability initiatives in these areas, with community-led task forces deciding how to allocate funding in their zones. The city and task forces track the outcomes of the initiatives, another key point for governments preparing to invest funds.
These new federal relief funds can also be used to invest in workforce development in response to the job and wage loss during the pandemic. Jobs in energy efficiency offer higher wages than the national average, but most employers in the industry have reported difficulty finding trained employees. Workforce development efforts can get people back to work and ensure availability of a skilled workforce. Because clean energy jobs are disproportionately held by white workers and male workers, governments can partner with utilities and community organizations to train more women and people of color for energy efficiency jobs.
For example, the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA) plans to invest more than $100 million by 2025 to advance energy efficiency and clean energy job training. In partnership with businesses and organizations that support these efforts, NYSERDA focuses on training and job placement services for individuals with disabilities, veterans, environmental justice communities, former power plant workers, and other priority communities.
Support public health
Relief funds distributed to governments around the country can “support public health expenditures by funding COVID-19 mitigation efforts, medical expenses, behavioral healthcare, and certain public health and safety staff.” They can also be used to make improvements in people’s homes to improve health. Because energy efficiency measures can reduce exposure to pollution and mold, control temperature, and otherwise improve the health of places where people live and work, public health expenditures that address energy efficiency can support economic recovery and health simultaneously. Governments can also make health and efficiency improvements in their own facilities.
Federal relief funds can be used to address health disparities, such as the asthma too often experienced by people residing in substandard housing, where mold and other triggers can flourish.  Well-targeted energy efficiency initiatives in affordable housing, including better sealing a home to reduce asthma triggers, can help. Successful, income-targeted energy efficiency programming can include health and safety measures. For example, New Hampshire’s NHSaves Home Energy Assistance Program offers funding for equipment that improves health and safety, such as bathroom fans and vents that improve ventilation and decrease exposure to mold, moisture, and pollutants.
What’s next?
Assistance to governments in the American Rescue Plan could drive monumental progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, boosting our economy, and reducing the energy bills of people struggling the most, today and for years to come. Energy efficiency efforts, such as those highlighted here, can be a valuable tool for governments across the country navigating the pandemic recovery.
To inform the use of these funds and potential future federal investments, ACEEE will partner with the Emerald Cities Collaborative, National Association of State Energy Officials, and the National League of Cities to showcase equitable, effective efficiency programs that governments across the country can learn from as they prepare to invest federal relief funds. We encourage governments using American Rescue Plan funds for energy efficiency or renewable energy programs to let us know about your work for our research; please contact Amanda Dewey.

Electric Trucks: Steady Progress in the Past 18 Months;"Electric trucks—which are essential to reducing carbon emissions—have come a long way in many segments of the market, even in just the last 18 months. New models are entering the market, and policy efforts to grow vehicle sales and expand charging infrastructure are expanding rapidly, according to an updated ACEEE analysis published today.
Trucks, ranging from heavy-duty pickup trucks to 18-wheelers, account for 22% of vehicle CO2 emissions. They also emit substantial amounts of other pollutants, contributing to climate change and health problems. Electric trucks can dramatically reduce these emissions. Our update to an early 2020 report, Electrifying Trucks: From Delivery Vans to Buses to 18-Wheelers, shows rapid progress in product offerings, supporting infrastructure, and policy development. The report surveys the state of the electric truck market and related policies, summarizing and synthesizing a wealth of information in one resource.
Vehicles
Many new vehicle models have been introduced to the market in the past 18 months. For example, Amazon is now testing electric delivery vans on the road as part of a commitment to purchase 100,000 of the vans. Likewise, UPS will be purchasing electric delivery vans from Arrival, and Ford and GM have announced similar products. There has also been substantial progress on heavy-duty pickup trucks, with products announced from five manufacturers; deliveries of some are scheduled to begin later this year.
At the other end of the size spectrum, six manufacturers are now working with customers to road-test tractor-trailers that can go at least 150 miles before needing recharge, including one with a 500-mile range. Many of these trucks will be in limited production later this year. It appears that the Volvo VNR may be the first to market. For the most part, because of their range, these vehicles will initially target regional-haul routes.

Electrification of transit and school buses is also progressing. For example, a new Maryland law requires the Baltimore-area transit agency to only purchase zero-emissions buses starting in 2023. Four manufacturers are now selling electric school buses, including all three major suppliers to the North American market. Three manufacturers are even selling electric garbage trucks in the United States. Because these trucks make frequent stops, travel short distances, and are typically very noisy in their diesel versions, they are an ideal early application for electric vehicles.
Supporting Infrastructure
The Biden administration is proposing major federal investments in charging infrastructure, and many states and utilities are expanding and accelerating their own efforts. Southern California Edison, for example, is helping customers assess charging needs and offering incentives for chargers and associated electrical upgrades. Leading utilities are also starting to integrate future charging needs into their grid planning, although most have not yet begun to do so. Advance planning is crucial because electric power needs can be substantial. An individual 18-wheeler may need 1.6 MW of power to charge (equivalent to the power needed by 160 typical homes), electric delivery-vehicle fleets may need on the order of 4 MW, and one large bus fleet is now using 13 MW of power.
Policy
There have also been substantial policy developments in the past 18 months. California has adopted a standard requiring a growing percentage of trucks to be zero emission (generally meaning battery electric or fuel cell), as shown in the figure below.
California zero-emissions sales percentage schedule by vehicle group and model year. Source: ICCT.
A group of 15 states, many in the Northeast, plus the District of Columbia, have signed an agreement to consider similar heavy-duty targets based on the California program. Likewise, three Northeast states plus DC have signed an agreement to establish a cap-and-trade program for transportation emissions, with eight additional states pledging to coordinate their programs with these states. Money collected from auctioning emissions allowances will be dedicated to reducing transportation emissions, including some investments in electric trucks and infrastructure. At the federal level, expanded tax credits for electric trucks and infrastructure are being developed. For example, the Senate Finance Committee has reported out legislation to provide a 30% tax credit for electric truck purchases.
Next Steps
Our new report concludes that for electric trucks to thrive, federal and state governments, policy makers, utilities, truck manufacturers, and truck buyers/users must take a variety of steps, particularly to reduce purchase costs and expand charging infrastructure. Each of these stakeholders has an important role in this process of getting to zero-emission trucks.

Is This the Year Congress Funds Low-Carbon, Equitable Transportation?;"Congress could finally be taking significant steps to address the climate impacts and numerous inequities of the transportation sector. The INVEST in America Act, set to be considered by the U.S. House’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee today, would make greenhouse gas emissions and equitable transportation access key components of  investment decisions.
Transportation is a fundamental driver of the U.S. economy, connecting people to job centers and services and improving the economic competitiveness of the country as a whole. It accounts for close to a third of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated in the United States and has surpassed the electricity sector as the largest emitter in the country. People with low incomes and communities of color are disproportionately burdened by pollution from passenger and freight transportation, and they often face inadequate access to efficient and affordable mobility options. Previous transportation infrastructure packages paid very little attention to these environmental and equity challenges.
In addition to setting aside almost $4 billion dollars for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the House’s $547 billion plan, introduced by Democratic leaders of the transportation committee on Friday, includes a series of key provisions that directs the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), states, and metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) to include GHG emissions and equity as considerations in transportation planning and for state and city projects. The reauthorization bill, focused on transportation funding, could be a key component of major infrastructure legislation this year. Including these provisions in a final bill is critical.
A range of strong provisions
The new bill increases funding and improves numerous requirements from the previous surface transportation reauthorization bill, introduced in the House in June 2020. Additionally, the INVEST bill is far better than a parallel Senate bill, advanced through committee in May, which includes very few provisions to tie transportation investments to environmental impact and equitable mobility access.
Of particular note, the House bill includes a requirement that DOT, in collaboration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), establish performance measures that will help states evaluate the GHG emissions and mobility access impacts of their transportation systems. A similar performance measure was rolled back by the Trump administration in 2017 without notice. These performance measures will be vital to ensuring that states’ transportation investments will have net emissions reductions and will increase access to equitable, safe, reliable, and convenient transportation that connects people to jobs and services. The Senate bill includes similar language on measures to evaluate GHG impacts but does not consider transportation access as part of its performance measure requirements.
To support these efforts, INVEST requires states and the MPOs to incorporate the reduction of GHG emissions and localized pollutants and the improvement of mobility access in their transportation planning process. INVEST also pushes them to consider land use and housing policy through more holistic planning efforts.
The 2021 House bill keeps the two new climate-related programs that were included in the proposed 2020 language. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Program provide states with $8.3 billion over four years (2022–2025) to spend on transportation programs that are expected to reduce GHG emissions. The federal DOT would be required to monitor states’ progress and report on their emissions reductions. Local entities including MPOs, governments, and transit agencies, would also have $250 million available through competitive community climate innovation grants that prioritize projects that have the greatest emissions-reduction potential, while ensuring that they provide diverse transportation choices and improved accessibility, among other equity impacts. The Senate bill, by comparison, has approximately $6.4 billion for reducing GHG emissions from the transportation sector.
Key policies for freight planning
INVEST takes particular care to reduce GHG emissions from freight transportation and address inequitable air pollution from the sector, with provisions not included in the Senate bill. Domestic goods movement accounts for more than 30% of U.S. transportation CO2 emissions and is also a significant contributor to localized air pollution, which often disproportionately affects households with low incomes and communities of color. While electrifying freight vehicles will go a long way to addressing their emissions, improvements to the overall efficiency of the freight system will be equally necessary to making significant emissions reductions, improving the economy, and addressing congestion.
Of particular note, INVEST incorporates GHG and equity metrics into freight planning at the national and state levels. It expands the goals of the National Highway Freight Program (NHFP), a program that helps improve the efficient movement of freight on U.S. roads. The bill would ensure, for the first time, that the program incorporates greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollution, and impact on local communities located near freight facilities as part of its goals. Therefore, funding distributed to states through the NHFP would be required to go toward activities that significantly reduce GHG emissions, local pollution, and inequities. In tandem, this provision removes an outdated limit on the share of funding that can go to projects that facilitate multimodal goods movement, such as investments in intermodal facilities. Such projects could be funded as long as they deliver public benefits, which would provide an additional incentive to states and cities to invest in projects that maximize the use of more efficient rail, water, and intermodal freight facilities. The Senate bill includes none of the environmental and equity provisions for freight and keeps the multimodal funding cap in place, though increasing it to 30% from the current limit of 10%.
Under INVEST, states will not be eligible for general freight funding unless they have developed state freight plans that include consideration of environmental and equity impacts. This is necessary because ACEEE has found that most state freight plans today do not consider these impacts. This provision and the ones described above are in line with recommendations ACEEE provided in a review of state freight plans last year to further state and federal efforts to incorporate GHG emissions reductions into freight planning. The bill also includes similar requirements for the National Multimodal Freight Policy and the National Freight Strategic Plan, both of which have great potential for advancing system efficiency in the freight sector.
Other important freight provisions in the bill include the creation of the Gridlock Reduction Grant Program and reauthorization of the national cooperative multimodal freight research program for the first time since fiscal year 2009. INVEST funds the grant program at $500 million (double the amount from last year’s bill) and dedicates 50% to freight-specific projects in large urban areas that use innovative and technology-enabled first- and last-mile delivery solutions, curb space pricing and management efforts, and real-time freight parking and routing. This grant program will be supported by the research program’s work on the impact of freight on the environment and technological solutions to improve goods movement.
Each of the elements described above will be crucial for creating a reauthorization bill that ensures that transportation infrastructure is funded in a manner that reduces carbon emissions and dramatically improves the equity of our mobility systems.

Climate-Forward Efficiency Efforts for Utility Customers Advance in Three States;"Arizona, California, and Minnesota have recently taken climate-forward steps that will use energy efficiency to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions while also saving consumers money on utility bills and improving health and safety.
Minnesota lawmakers strengthen and retune efficiency programs
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz recently signed a bill into law that gives utilities more options for how they help customers save energy. The Energy Conservation and Optimization (ECO) Act, passed with bipartisan support and the product of rigorous stakeholder engagement, is a “next-generation energy efficiency resource standard” (EERS) that will modernize state energy efficiency policy. 
The law updates the very successful Conservation Improvement Program (CIP), which is funded by ratepayers and run by electricity and natural gas utilities. The law increases the energy savings goals—the EERS—for investor-owned utilities (IOUs) to 1.75% of gross annual retail sales (from 1.5%) and the goal for investor-owned gas utilities to 1% of gross annual sales (from 0.5%). The law also raises energy efficiency spending to assist households with low incomes.
The ECO Act supports the use of efficient fuel-switching improvements (such as from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump) by counting these actions toward a portion of energy savings goals, if the improvements are cost effective, reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and improve system load factor (a measure of efficiency across the whole system). Until now, Minnesota was one of many states with antiquated rules that prevented utilities from incentivizing customers to switch to the lowest-carbon heating options.
California regulators update rules to enable bigger climate impacts
In California, utility regulators approved new rules last month that reformed the state’s energy efficiency policies to focus on reducing carbon emissions. Despite its long record of success in efficiency, California’s most recent energy savings goals, set in 2019, were just half of what they were in 2015. That was largely because of unbalanced screening tests, which counted all of the costs of energy efficiency and only a portion of the benefits these resources provide, and goal-setting processes that didn’t line up with the state’s policies, including the ambitious goal in SB 350 to double efficiency savings by 2030.
To address these issues, the new efficiency goals will be set in a fuel-agnostic way that removes silos between energy and peak demand savings. Instead of measuring success based on kilowatt-hours, kilowatts, and therms, utilities will have one “total system benefit” (TSB) metric that encourages energy savings at the most valuable times and locations to the grid, and that embraces benefits beyond energy and capacity, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The goal is also set based on savings over the lifecycle of technologies, eliminating potential bias toward short-lived measures. As a result, the next set of energy efficiency goals and program offerings from utilities and program implementors, which will take effect in 2024, will better value efficiency as a grid and decarbonization resource. And removing silos between resources like energy efficiency, storage, and demand response should enable more flexibility and market innovation. For example, utilities could design programs that give customers incentives to both manage the timing of their energy use to help the grid and save energy and money on their bill across the year through innovative technologies like efficient water heaters.
The rules encourage utilities to offer more programs that primarily serve people of color and residents with low incomes, including efforts that increase home comfort and safety, improve resilience, and reduce energy bills. The rules also encourage programs that support the long-term success of efficiency companies and professionals, through consumer education, workforce training, and research, development, and deployment of innovative technologies. Each program category—resource acquisition, equity, and market development—will have separate budgets and portfolios, which will be evaluated separately to connect oversight to the purpose of each portfolio. This should enable utilities to maximize equity and market development benefits.
Arizona regulators may extend efficiency goals, set clean energy rules
The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) approved a new clean-energy rules package late last month. The proposed package highlights the role of energy efficiency in reducing emissions from the power sector by extending the existing EERS until 2030 and requiring a carbon-free grid by 2070 (an earlier plan would have required fully clean energy by 2050). While there is less evolution in how energy efficiency is valued as a climate-forward resource in this rule, it’s notable that energy efficiency is explicitly embedded as a part of a carbon-free grid rule. As we mentioned in a previous post, Arizona efficiency programs and other clean-energy efforts have been in jeopardy because of policy disagreements among members of the ACC. While this recent vote is a very good development, it sets up another round of public input before the rules can be formally approved later this year.
What’s ahead?
The actions by Minnesota, California, and Arizona follow a banner year for extending, expanding, and evolving EERS around the country. Getting utilities to deliver the energy-saving improvements needed to meet climate goals requires these strong energy efficiency resource standards, along with a host of other tools. Looking forward this year, we hope to see continued progress to implement new EERS and evolve them into climate-forward efficiency policies. New Hampshire, where a settlement agreement on utility programs awaits regulator approval, and Puerto Rico, where a new energy efficiency rule is being deliberated, offer additional opportunities to take big steps in the right direction for the climate and utility customers.

IEA: Behavior Change Is Critical for Reaching Net-Zero Energy;"The good news is that, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the world can reach net-zero energy by 2050. The not-so-good news is that the world has a lot of heavy lifting to do. Notably, nearly two-thirds (roughly 63%) of the energy reduction needed to reach the net-zero goal will require people to change the way they do things – change their behavior and enthusiastically embrace more-efficient and healthier practices for the planet and themselves.
As the IEA puts it, “It is ultimately people who drive demand for energy‐related goods and services, and societal norms and personal choices will play a pivotal role in steering the energy system onto a sustainable path.”
This large-scale shift in behavior is not news to ACEEE, which has embedded behavior research and policy advocacy into its work since its inception more than 40 years ago. For others, though, it may come as something of a surprise, so let’s look at exactly what the IEA proposes and what we can do to get there.
What Is behavior change?
As part of behavior change, the IEA includes any energy savings that require consumers to change their demand for energy. Although nearly 40% of energy savings can be achieved without any shifts in consumer decisions or lifestyles, the rest will come from changes in how we do things, from adopting new technologies to changing how (and how much) we travel. The IEA identifies as critical three main categories of behavior:
-         Reducing excessive or wasteful energy use: These behaviors include actions like adjusting indoor temperature settings and reducing driving speeds.
-         Transportation mode switching: These behaviors relate to how we get around. Although two important steps are reducing single-occupancy vehicle use and phasing down cars in cities, the IEA calls out “reduced aviation demand” as the single most important change in transportation behavior. By keeping business and long-haul flights at 2019 levels and shifting many local flights to rail (probably about 17% of worldwide flights by 2050), aviation reductions can account for 80% of the travel-related emissions reductions by 2050. Notably, aviation travel demand is an under-studied area of transportation policy and behavior change and, going forward, should be the subject of increasing study and effort.
-         Materials efficiency gains: This is a catch-all term to describe behaviors that reduce demand for materials. These mainly come from changes in building and automotive construction and design, as well as higher rates of recycling. Changes occur primarily through vehicle and buildings standards, which have the potential to regulate and eliminate the use of carbon-intensive building materials. However, the IEA notes that “societal preferences” drive changes in these types of policies – building standards, for example, are rarely mandated before builders voluntarily adopt them.
How can we change behavior on a large scale?
Achieving 63% energy reduction from behavior change might seem difficult or even impossible to people familiar with only a limited number of “behavior change programs,” such as home energy reports, which reduce consumption by an average of 1%-2% per household.
Indeed, the IEA describes multiple pathways for encouraging behavior change, with these sorts of voluntary “nudge” strategies (changing how energy decisions are framed and presented) accounting for only about 8% of energy savings. The report notes that “targeted government policies and infrastructure development” will account for about 75% of behavior change-related energy reductions. Some evidence suggests that public sentiment can change following implementation of environmental policies, as in Stockholm, where less than 40% of the population supported congestion pricing before implementation, but 70% supported it three years later.
The IEA describes three main strategies for changing behavior: 
Regulations and mandates: Examples include reducing speed limits, augmenting appliance and building standards, and establishing regulations that will help eventually shift passengers from short flights to trains.
Market-based instruments: Examples include congestion pricing, taxes on fuel/distance/carbon, and mandatory energy labeling of products.
Information and awareness: (“nudges”): Examples include personalized travel planning assistance, product labeling/public awareness campaigns, and comparison information and feedback.
Will it work in the USA?
Some may wonder if the IEA-recommended behavioral strategies that succeed in Europe could be expanded to the U.S. or the rest of the world, considering the different political, geographic, and social realities. For example, compared to the U.S., Europe has a better developed rail system, more walkable cities, and more appetite for the types of “disincentive” policies that the IEA applauds. The IEA acknowledges and somewhat accounts for regional variations, noting some regions will be faster at making these changes than others. Nevertheless, as it notes, much work needs to be done, particularly in wealthier countries.
Where do we go from here?
The report shows that, although technology development is important, people need to adopt the technology for it to have an impact. In essence, you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. Without behavior change, including a demand for efficient technology and a willingness to adopt a reduced-carbon lifestyle, we cannot achieve the emissions reduction we need to reach net-zero energy by 2050.
Importantly, however, the IEA report shows that this desire and drive to change is already starting to take hold, and policies and programs to encourage these changes are within our reach. ACEEE is committed to take on this challenge and conduct research demonstrating a path toward a clean energy future using behavioral science, policy recommendations, and other tools at our disposal.

Despite Major Efforts, China Still Needs to Cut Greenhouse Gases by at Least as Much as U.S. Emissions;"As the Biden administration ramps up U.S. efforts to address climate change, comparisons to other countries are often raised, particularly to China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Its energy-related emissions are almost double those of the United States. Furthermore, new data indicate that China’s emissions jumped 15% in the first quarter of this year relative to last year, as China rebounds from its COVID-19 lockdown.
The China Energy Outlook, compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), finds that China is taking steps to improve its energy efficiency and cut emissions but both will likely continue to increase in the 2020s as the country continues its building spree and remains reliant on coal. The Berkeley Lab Outlook also shows that China has done a lot to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions but has much more to do – an amount equivalent to total current U.S. emissions hangs in the balance.
Energy and Emissions Trends
As part of China’s 13th Five-Year-Plan period (2016-2020), China set 2020 goals of reducing energy intensity and CO2 emission intensity by 15% and 18%, respectively, and deriving approximately 15% of total primary energy from non-fossil sources.
Despite its rising emissions, Berkeley Lab finds that China appears to be on track to meet these key goals because of several factors: energy efficiency; growth in the service-sector proportion of China’s economy; growth in renewable, nuclear, and natural gas energy; and a modestly declining portion of energy use coming from coal. (Coal use is still growing but growing more slowly than in boom years in the past).
Policies
The Outlook profiles 42 Chinese policies focused on reducing energy and related emissions. Some notable examples are:
·       Appliance and equipment standards: China currently has mandatory efficiency standards on 73 product categories, compared to more than 60 in the United States.
·       Light- and heavy-duty vehicle fuel economy standards: The current Chinese standard for passenger vehicles (about 35 miles per gallon in 2020) is more stringent than the U.S. standard (about 31 mpg in 2020) (see here).
·       Electric vehicle incentives: China’s New Energy Vehicle program promotes electric and fuel cell vehicles with incentives, a large build-out of charging infrastructure, and other steps. Preliminary data show 1.34 million electric vehicles were sold in China in 2020, compared to 0.33 million in the United States; China has also made world-leading progress on electrifying buses.
·       Local government carbon targets: As part of its Low-Carbon Pilot Cities and Provinces Program, 83 cities and provinces have established targets for when CO2 emissions will peak. They are conducting energy and GHG emissions inventories, preparing action plans, and establishing local standards and incentives.
Many of China’s policies are similar to policies in the U.S. and other countries, which provided lessons for Chinese policymakers. Likewise, U.S. policymakers may be able to learn from some aspects of Chinese policies.
China’s Energy and Emissions Future
Multiple studies project China’s energy use and emissions out to 2050 under various scenarios, as shown in the figure below. Most scenarios published in the last two years show emissions peaking by 2030, but some show level emissions through 2050 while others show declines. In its continuous improvement scenario, Berkeley Lab shows that emissions could decline dramatically by 2050 if China adopts the maximum share of today’s commercially available, cost-effective energy efficiency and renewable energy supply by 2050.
The difference between level emissions from 2030 to 2050 and the Berkeley Lab Continuous Improvement Scenario is the same order of magnitude as current U.S. emissions, showing the importance of China embracing this lower-emissions path. The Berkeley Lab and several other scenarios are shown in the figure below.
  Conclusion
China has an impressive track record of energy and emissions policies that are putting it on track to reach peak emissions by 2030, but it clearly needs to do much more — and quickly. As the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, China has a special obligation to reduce its emissions given their very large impact on the global environment. The same can be said of the United States; the two countries together account for more than 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
In September 2020, Chinese President Xi pledged that China would peak its total CO2 emissions before 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060. This pledge goes beyond even the Berkeley Lab scenario.
The Berkeley Lab China Energy Outlook shows a path for China to pursue improved energy efficiency and use of renewable energy to dramatically reduce its emissions, but even more effort will be needed to meet China’s new goals. Berkeley Lab is now exploring deep decarbonization pathways for China to meet their new goal. China should pursue such a path, and the United States should assist while also putting itself on a similar path. ACEEE will continue to track energy policies in China, the United States, and other countries in a new edition of our International Energy Efficiency Scorecard, set to be published next year.

Analysis: Gasoline Costs Consume Nearly 20% of Some Household Budgets;"Many of the lowest-income U.S. households spend nearly one-fifth of their income on gasoline—three times more than the average U.S. household, according to an analysis released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Investments in transportation infrastructure have historically displaced low-income communities and communities of color, pushing them farther and farther away from employment centers. Land-use policies that favor personal vehicles and encourage sprawl have left these communities with inconsistent access to efficient, low-carbon forms of transportation, often forcing them to use inefficient personal vehicles to get to work and essential services. The result is that too many Americans have high expenses for vehicles, fuel, insurance, and maintenance. In many cases, this creates higher transportation burdens (defined as the portion of annual income spent on transportation costs).
ACEEE’s latest analysis focuses on the energy-use component of transportation burdens, specifically gasoline costs. We used 2013 self-report data from the American Housing Survey (AHS) to estimate transportation energy burdens. While this information is somewhat dated and doesn’t reflect the recent emergence of technology-enabled mobility options or the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, these data let us estimate real-world burdens without relying on modeled monthly gasoline expenditures. We analyzed data from both the national and metropolitan samples from AHS. The metropolitan sample contains data on 24 metropolitan statistical areas and represents approximately 28% of the total U.S. population.
In the national sample, low-income households had an average burden of 13.8%, compared to just 4.1% for higher-income households. A deeper dive into how gasoline costs vary by income shows that this burden is even higher, 18.3%, for the very lowest-income groups, i.e., those that earn less than $20,800 annually, indicating a need for policy interventions that focus on this population.
ACEEE’s analysis also confirms that Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities bear greater gasoline burdens than their white counterparts. Nationally, Native American households experience the highest burdens at 10.9%, followed closely by Hispanic and Black households at 9.2% and 9.1%, respectively. These burdens vary quite a bit geographically. For instance, Black households in the South Central United States (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana) see much higher burdens than in other parts of the country. The COVID-19 pandemic has likely made some of these differences even starker.
Access to public transit and other mobility options can help address high transportation expenses for low-income households. However, public transit saw a steep drop in fare-based revenues before and during the pandemic. As a result, transit agencies have been forced to roll back service and infrastructure expansion. Because public transit disproportionately serves low-income residents and commuters of color, these changes have a direct impact on the affordability and accessibility of transportation for the most economically vulnerable households.
To comprehensively mitigate high gasoline burdens, policymakers should integrate transportation, land-use, and housing policy solutions to create livable, sustainable, healthy communities. Similarly, solutions should do more than just improve the efficiency of personal vehicles, which only saves money for those who rely on cars or light trucks. We must also improve access to a wide array of affordable and efficient transportation options, like public transit and shared bicycles and scooters. Tailored policies are needed at the city, state, and federal levels to address the specific barriers and burdens encountered by low-income households as well as Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities. To develop that suite of tailored policies, cities and communities should engage with those residents who are most directly impacted by transportation options to identify key mobility needs and gaps, and to develop solutions while keeping costs low.

IEA: Tripling the Speed of Efficiency Progress a Must for a Net-Zero Carbon World;"By taking unprecedented action that transforms how energy is produced, transported, and used, the world can eliminate net emissions of carbon dioxide by 2050, according to a report released today by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The report makes clear that this goal will require rapid scaling of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and electrification.
“The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal—our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5 °C—make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,” said Fatih Birol, IEA’s executive director, in unveiling the findings. IEA called the 227-page report, for which I served as a peer reviewer, the world’s first comprehensive study of how to transition to a net-zero energy system by 2050.
IEA’s report emphasizes that for the world to decarbonize, a major global push to increase energy efficiency is “essential.” The result of this push would be a global rate of efficiency improvements averaging 4% per year through 2030—about three times the average over the last two decades. In addition, electrification and behavior change can further reduce energy demand, as shown in this figure:
Energy demand avoided by efficiency, electrification, and behavior change in the IEA net-zero scenario.
Most of the global reductions in CO2 emissions between now and 2030 in the net-zero pathway come from technologies readily available today, including energy efficiency, solar, and wind. But this decade will also be important for researching and beginning to scale deployments of electrification; hydrogen; carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); and reduced use of carbon-intensive products. In the 2030s and 2040s, efficiency and renewable energy efforts need to continue, with the use of hydrogen, CCUS, behavior change, and changes in product mix accelerating:
Emissions reductions by mitigation measure in the IEA net-zero scenario.
According to IEA’s scenario, by 2050, almost half of the emissions reductions will come from technologies that are now only at the demonstration or prototype phase. “This demands that governments quickly increase and reprioritize their spending on research and development—as well as on demonstrating and deploying clean energy technologies—putting them at the core of energy and climate policy,” IEA said in its press release. “Progress in the areas of advanced batteries, electrolyzers for hydrogen, and direct air capture and storage can be particularly impactful.“
IEA outlines the scenario we need to achieve by 2050: “Global energy demand is around 8% smaller than today, but it serves an economy more than twice as big and a population with 2 billion more people. Almost 90% of electricity generation comes from renewable sources, with wind and solar PV together accounting for almost 70%. Most of the remainder comes from nuclear power.” 
IEA summarizes key milestones that will be needed to get on the net-zero pathway in the figure below. For 2030, this includes that all new buildings are zero-energy-ready and 60% of new passenger vehicles are electric. By 2035, most appliances, cooling systems, and electric motors need to be best-in-class, and 50% of heavy truck sales must be electric. And in the 2030s and 2040s, the vast majority of existing buildings are retrofitted to be zero-energy-ready.
Key milestones in the IEA net-zero pathway.
The IEA study is a global one but also illustrates a path forward for the United States. Based on ACEEE’s work on the role of energy efficiency in decarbonization, I believe efficiency can be deployed to a greater degree than IEA shows (our 2019 report found that efficiency can reduce 2050 greenhouse gas emissions in half). The IEA report correctly shows a major role for electrification and significant roles for hydrogen and behavior change. It may, in my view, overemphasize the role of CCUS.
Still, the IEA report is an important milestone, showing a plausible but narrow pathway for getting to decarbonization. But to achieve such a feat, governments, businesses, and households will need to dramatically and quickly scale up their decarbonization efforts.

With Ever-Hotter Summers Ahead, Arizonans Might Lose Help Saving Energy;"[Update, 5/28/21: On May 26, the clean energy rules were revived in a 3-2 Arizona Corporation Commission vote approving a compromise set of rules that would reestablish the requirement to reach a 100% carbon-free power sector, but extend the ultimate target date from the originally proposed 2050 to 2070; the 2032 goal of 50% would remain unchanged from the original proposal.
Notably, the newly approved rules would extend and expand the state’s energy efficiency resource standard (EERS) for electric utilities. This includes a capacity-based standard requiring savings equal to a 35% reduction in 2020 peak demand by 2030. They also include an annual MWh savings target of 1.3% (averaged over each 3-year planning period). The May 26 vote restarts the clock on the formal rulemaking process, with a public comment period to run through August 20, followed by a final Commission vote that will need to take place before the rules can take effect. New developments in the proceeding can be followed in this docket.]
Original post:
Arizona residents face rising heat and often-challenging energy bills, but help on saving energy is now seriously at risk. State regulators this month scuttled proposed clean energy rules that would have extended and expanded requirements for utilities to help customers make energy efficiency improvements. The development comes as several other states in the Southwest and across the nation have added or extended binding energy-saving targets for the programs.
Energy efficiency is no small matter in Arizona’s heat. Last summer, Phoenix broke a series of temperature records, seeing 53 days above 110 degrees. Air-conditioning is vital, but it can be expensive to run, particularly with older equipment or poorly sealed homes. On average, low-income households in the Phoenix metropolitan area devote 7% of their income to energy costs. Older and especially homebound residents must have safe, affordable access to air-conditioning.
With this backdrop, the Arizona Corporation Commission had been preparing to extend the state’s mandate for the utilities’ energy-saving programs as part of a move to a 100% carbon-free grid. That policy, an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), was among the strongest in the country when the regulators set it in 2010, effectively requiring utilities to achieve cumulative annual electricity savings of 22% by 2020 (or roughly 2% on average annually) through efficiency investments.
Today, many Arizona homeowners can receive significant rebates through their utilities to help pay for efficiency upgrades, like purchasing an ENERGY STAR®-certified AC system or improving insulation. The EERS and resulting efficiency investments have reduced energy costs for households and businesses by four times as much as costs, and they save energy equivalent to that used by 500,000 homes per year. This benefits all electricity customers by reducing total utility system costs associated with energy and infrastructure expenses.
But the EERS required an extension, because it had effectively reached its concluding energy-saving goal in 2020, taking away its teeth. ACEEE research has found that maintaining binding multiyear utility energy savings targets through an EERS is the most important policy driver of utilities’ efficiency programs, correlating with four times larger energy savings.
Progress in sight, then derailed
Regulators had a plan in motion last year. They drafted and advanced a rule that would steer the state toward 100% carbon-free electricity, with an extension of the EERS playing a key role.
Last week, the commission reversed course. A 3–2 majority adopted an amendment that would gut the heart of the rule by making the clean energy and efficiency requirements optional. The commission subsequently voted down the full, weakened rule, effectively leaving the plan moribund.
Efficiency improvements, jobs now in limbo
The recent decision leaves in limbo the future of energy efficiency work in Arizona and its economic benefits for households, businesses, and the workforce. The state has more than 9,000 energy efficiency businesses, some of which do work funded through the utility programs.
If Arizona is to keep pace with its neighbors and maintain stable and effective efficiency programs, the commission will need to reintroduce and adopt an EERS with a strong long-term savings goal. Until then, the power is now largely in the hands of the state’s utilities to provide strong efficiency programs.
A recent report published by SWEEP found that APS, the state’s largest electric utility, could use a suite of efficiency, renewable energy, and energy storage investments to save ratepayers $1.4 billion through 2035. The utility’s last efficiency plan, approved in September, was generally strong.
But without a strong requirement to deliver energy efficiency, will the utility continue to capture this low-cost resource for customers and support the energy efficiency economy? That’s what we hope to see.
In time, regulators will need to set a new, stronger efficiency standard. But for now, for Arizonans hoping to reduce their energy bills, the outlook is murky.

How Could DOE’s $40B Loans Program Fund Efficiency? The New Director Has These Ideas;"The Biden administration has set a bold target for reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and has proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan to help achieve it. As part of its efforts, the Department of Energy (DOE) is gearing up to offer $40 billion in loans and loan guarantees to deploy large-scale energy infrastructure projects.
How will DOE select projects that promise great impact and cut emissions? To answer this question, Jigar Shah will kick off this month’s virtual Energy Efficiency Finance Forum. You may know Shah as the former co-host of the Energy Gang podcast and co-founder of Generate Capital, but he recently joined the Biden administration as director of DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO).
REGISTER FOR FINANCE FORUM
In his keynote address, Shah will discuss strategies and partnerships that could open the LPO's loan capital to energy efficiency initiatives. Attendees will learn why this federal portfolio has historically not funded efficiency projects and what can be done to change that.
Source: DOE LPO
As a sneak peak, I recently chatted with Shah about his new role at DOE. Below are excerpts from the conversation.
What are your goals for the LPO?
My goal is for LPO to serve as a bridge to bankability for technologies that can have a big impact. We want the projects we finance to serve as a jumping off point for commercial lenders to come in so we can meet what the science is saying we need to achieve to reduce harmful emissions and provide more equitable access to this energy transition.
What is the biggest challenge for the LPO in funding energy efficiency projects?
In general, most energy efficiency projects are small and so very few people think of us as a way to aggregate many small projects into one large financing. Separately, it is easier to read the meter on something that generates energy versus reading the meter on “negawatts”—the watts that were saved because of efficiency or conservation.
The good news is that the LPO can offer loans with longer durations than most commercial lenders are willing to offer. And because our goal is to advance the energy transition in a big way, we’re engaging with many of the energy efficiency loan platforms, taking the time to develop better ways of financing efficiency projects.
What exactly makes for a great loan candidate?
A great candidate for LPO’s Innovative Energy Loan Guarantee Program has technology that has been demonstrated to work but has never been deployed at commercial scale. Such candidates have shown that customers have an appetite for their approach. They also have some sense of how to keep the assets performing well for the life of our loan.
What role could LPO-financed energy efficiency projects play in supporting the administration’s equity and diversity goals?
For far too long, communities of color and low-income communities have paid for essential appliances and transportation at payday lending interest rates that are far higher than conventional loan products. We can review actual loan repayment rates and provide these communities access to debt capital at competitive rates. LPO can work with states, cities, utilities, companies, tribal governments, and nonprofits to offer access to energy efficiency products at an affordable cost, and do so at a scale that really gives all Americans access to the latest technology.
For more information, email the LPO to request a pre-application consultation.

Energy Management Proves Cost Effective in Industrial and Commercial Facilities;"Washington, DC—Emerging methods to manage energy use in industrial and commercial facilities are more than paying off through reduced energy costs, according to a new report. The findings are published in a report released today, prepared for the North American SEM Collaborative (NASEMC) by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
The report provides the most comprehensive snapshot to date of strategic energy management (SEM) —a systematic process to holistically manage energy use to improve efficiency. These management methods, which are at an early stage of adoption but growing in use, are often supported by electric and gas utilities, which provide technical assistance and incentives to spur continuous operational, maintenance, and energy management system changes to reduce energy needs.
The report findings are based primarily on interviews with the administrators of 24 utility programs across North America that support SEM efforts by energy customers. All 11 administrators who reported cost effectiveness values said their SEM programs are cost effective.
“This is the clearest evidence yet that SEM investments by energy customers and utilities with demand-side management (DSM) programs really pay off,” said Ed Rightor, report co-author and director of ACEEE’s industry program. “SEM is a quick way for industrial and commercial facilities to start reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions with low or no capital investment. We see a wide range of successful efforts and are more convinced than ever that these SEM practices and programs should be scaled up.”
There is no single methodology for determining cost effectiveness, and utilities calculate SEM annual energy savings and effective useful life values—both key factors—quite differently. For example, five programs expected annual savings to range from 2% to 5% (as a portion of their baseline energy consumption), while 11 others gave wider ranges. The SEM programs don’t expect a narrow range of energy savings typically, because their participants’ circumstances vary considerably.
“The data show the full value of SEM business practices is not captured in many cost effectiveness studies,” said Peter Therkelsen, report co-author and research scientist at Berkeley Lab. ""SEM program designers and regulators can use these data-driven findings to enhance metrics to quantify and track the magnitude and persistence of energy savings as well as the ability of customers to continually improve their own energy management business practices, the namesake concept of SEM programs.""
The vast majority of program representatives interviewed said SEM delivers greater energy savings than non-SEM programs, because it is a holistic approach that engages utility customers, helps them understand their energy use more deeply, and teaches them how to continually look for energy efficiency improvements. Most (88%) of those interviewed project that energy savings will persist after SEM program engagement ends.
The interviews with 24 utility program administrators also find:
Eighteen serve the industrial sector and 11 serve the commercial sector (some programs serve both sectors).
They have, on average, 6.8 years of experience with SEM programs.
They generally cater to medium and large customers, with only 17% supporting customers of any size.
Nineteen offer some form of financial incentives to customers for participating in the SEM program.
The effective useful life (EUL) used by the programs to calculate SEM savings varied widely across the 24 programs.
The report calls for future research to fully compare the cost effectiveness of different SEM measures and practices.
“The NASEMC is grateful for the work from Berkeley Lab and ACEEE on our first research report. We are looking forward to working with our members to determine what research topics we should tackle next,” said John Nicol, program director at Leidos and a member of the NASEMC Leadership Team. NASEMC, a member-driven project of ACEEE begun in 2018 to advance SEM’s impact, will hold its annual SEM summit this July at the virtual 2021 Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry, where it will hold interactive discussions on the report findings.

How to Fund Efficiency in Affordable Housing? Finance Forum Speakers Offer Insights;"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many low- to moderate-income households have struggled to pay their energy bills, as millions have lost critical income and many face higher utility bills because of increased time spent at home. Their homes, in particular, would benefit from energy-saving upgrades to reduce utility costs.
Yet such upgrades have historically attracted a relatively small share of financing. To address this inequity, ACEEE is holding an interactive session at this month’s Finance Forum: “Financing Efficiency in Low- to Moderate-Income and Affordable Multifamily Housing.” The panel will look at new capital sources and financing structures that target efficiency upgrades in this hard-to-reach market.
REGISTER FOR FINANCE FORUM
To give you a sneak peak, we reached out to the panel’s speakers with a few questions. Below are excerpts of our conversation with Kerry O’Neill, CEO of Inclusive Prosperity Capital, which invests in clean energy and resilience, and Candis Mary-Dauphin, program manager at StopWaste, a public agency in California’s Alameda County that helps people make smart decisions about the products they buy, the resources they use, and the items they no longer use.
Why have efficiency upgrades for affordable multifamily housing received little financing?
Kerry: Financing energy efficiency in affordable multifamily homes continues to be a challenge. This is in no small part due to the overall challenges of affordable multifamily housing: decades of disinvestment in the housing stock and a sector that is stretched beyond capacity in the best of times but even more so this past year with the pandemic and its devastating economic consequences. It is a complex sector with many different types of regulated and unregulated, subsidized and naturally occurring housing, as well as various disincentives and split incentives.  
Candis: In general, energy efficiency (EE) programs, which often generate leads for EE financing programs, have been oriented primarily to the markets that are most cost effective, not hard-to-reach markets that are more expensive (and therefore not as cost effective) to serve. The result, as shown by studies, is that the populations that utilize and benefit from EE programs are generally higher income. Meanwhile, the low-income programs limit the number of participants. So there is a big gap between eligibility for the low-income programs and households with the financial means to take advantage of the EE programs. 
How much has changed in recent years, and why is there more focus on social equity?
Candis: With the backdrop of events around racial inequality, systemic and institutional racism, as well as the unequal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and environmental catastrophes such as wildfires, as a coalition of local governments, we have sought to look for more opportunities to promote more-equitable outcomes across sectors and disciplines. Because of the multiple benefits of energy efficiency, we along with others are looking at ways that our work can target communities that struggle to thrive in the face of systemic oppression, with the goal of improving the health, resilience, and housing affordability for these residents.  
What are the biggest remaining obstacles for financing efficiency in this underserved sector? 
Kerry: One of my biggest pet peeves about our energy financing industry is that we are too focused on our needs and not focused enough on the needs of affordable multifamily housing owners and tenants. Unless it’s new construction, there are typically a lot of capital improvement needs that have to be addressed all at once (physical condition of building, roof, health and safety issues, etc.—not just energy systems/infrastructure). And we don’t typically create financing products that address all those needs or think about how we can easily work with other capital sources to do that. We just don’t make it easy for anyone, and we don’t often fund the technical assistance that is required to address the needs of this sector.  
Candis: One of the biggest remaining obstacles is that we haven’t found a way to integrate EE financing into traditional financing. Property owners seeking out financing and considering building upgrades are usually not looking for EE financing; rather, they are looking for financing that can be used for all their planned upgrades. As long as EE financing is its own little niche, it will not scale. Affordable housing finance already involves the stacking of multiple financing sources in a project deal. Adding specialty EE lenders and products may be too complex. 
How optimistic are you that financing such upgrades will happen quickly or robustly? 
Candis: By working with appraisers and the secondary market stakeholders to recognize the value of energy efficiency upgrades, we can get the attention of mainstream banking institutions. At that point, I think we’ll see an acceleration of energy efficiency financing. 
Kerry: I’m cautiously optimistic given the new Biden administration’s focus on climate, equity, and affordable housing. The financing sector is getting on board, but we need more products and programs on the ground that bring all the pieces together.

Time’s Up: We Need to Reimagine Utility Efficiency Efforts to Meet Climate Goals;"Utility energy efficiency programs have a proven record of saving energy and money, but here’s an uncomfortable truth: They aren’t yet up to the immense challenge of the climate crisis. Amid a rapid rise in renewable power generation and in technology enabling demand flexibility, it’s time to restructure these efficiency efforts. Utilities need to scale these programs up and focus them on doing their vital part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
While we’re excited to see that 48 utilities have set goals of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, few are currently making the investment decisions needed to get there, and even fewer are maximizing the emissions reductions possible from their energy-saving efforts. Meeting these goals will require an industry transformation: reforms to the utility business model, shifts in how utilities measure energy-saving progress, and new ways for regulators to prioritize approaches that reduce emissions.
With support from the Department of Energy, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and six major utilities and program administrators, we are launching our Climate-Forward Efficiency initiative today to engage stakeholders across the industry to create a roadmap for this transformation.
The shifting landscape of utility energy efficiency
Utilities’ programs to help customers improve energy efficiency have traditionally been designed to save a single resource, usually energy, typically measured in kWh or therms. But as the electric grid gets cleaner, technologies using electricity instead of burning fossil fuels in the home—like electric heat pumps—will increasingly be the lowest-carbon choice for heating a home and the water in it. Further, not all kWh are created equal; saving a kWh produced at a time of day or year when the power grid is drawing heavily from coal plants will do far more to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than saving it at a time where there is excess solar power, for instance. As we see adoption of a wider range of resources, such as solar and wind, utilities will need to be able to measure and capture efficiency investments that save energy at the times most valuable for reducing GHG from power generation.
Utility clean energy programs designed to save energy in kWh or therms are missing important decarbonization opportunities through flexibility and fuel switching. For example, a household that uses gas heating could save more GHG—and sometimes more energy and money—by switching to a heat pump instead of a gas furnace with improved efficiency. Yet in many states they may not even have that option available to them in utility programs. And without regulatory changes to value flexibility in rates, planning, and cost-effectiveness testing, they might not have the opportunity to manage their thermostat or HVAC system to save money by using it at times of day when the grid has more and cheaper electricity available. Funds for energy efficiency are limited, and utilities are making investment decisions using policy frameworks that don’t prioritize greenhouse gas reductions, community resilience to climate change, or equitable outcomes for communities that will be hardest hit by the effects of climate change.
Beyond the need to redefine success and realign utilities’ efficiency program portfolios, we need a massive increase in investments in those portfolios to achieve climate goals, like the Biden administration’s commitment to carbon-free electricity by 2035 and 100% carbon-free or net-zero electricity goals in 16 states. At the current rate of progress, it will take approximately 500 years to complete whole-building retrofits on all residences (homes and apartments) and more than 60 years to retrofit all commercial buildings. Utility and state efficiency programs have an infrastructure of trade allies (contractors, retailers, and manufacturers) and a workforce that’s ready to expand to meet this need.
Emerging emphasis on decarbonization in state and utility practices
In recent years, some states and utilities have begun to tackle these challenges, making changes to the policies that govern efficiency programs and to the programs themselves. Some states and utilities are starting to measure success using fuel-neutral metrics (energy savings or GHG), and some are bringing the time value of energy efficiency into cost effectiveness calculations and goals. And some states are starting to change the rules governing whether efficiency programs can encourage customers to switch from one fuel source to another, such as from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump. These changes allow ratepayers to invest in low-carbon fuel-switching measures and orient utility goals toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It is important to note that most states are also maintaining electricity savings targets as well. They are crucial for spurring home-sealing upgrades that enable and support electrification and are needed to meet long-term carbon goals and support customer resilience to winter reliability constraints. We do not want utilities just promoting electric vehicles and ignoring other key opportunities to reduce emissions.
ACEEE has set the ground for this initiative by researching emerging policy and program innovations for maximizing GHG reductions from efficiency. We profiled leading states taking innovative approaches with their energy efficiency resource standards, examined how states are adopting performance incentive mechanisms to encourage utilities to deliver energy savings at targeted times, and highlighted how efficiency and demand response and efficiency, solar, and storage can be bundled together in utility programs.
While our research efforts and engagement have identified leading states and utilities taking important first steps, the overwhelming bulk of this transformation remains ahead of us.
Reimagining efficiency programs with our new Climate-Forward Efficiency initiative
With our new Climate-Forward Efficiency initiative, our research will dig deeper into the misalignments facing utility portfolios—why we need to shift our practices—and how to do it to meet climate and affordability challenges. To understand why we need to shift our practices, we will explore the lessons learned and tradeoffs from early leaders taking steps to maximize GHG reductions from their efficiency portfolios. That research will identify best practices and options for changing definitions of efficiency and metrics for success to spur the most effective customer offerings for reducing GHG.
Changing definitions and goals will be insufficient; this shift will require changes across energy efficiency business practices. The evolution in business-as-usual energy efficiency will require action not only from utilities and their regulators, but from program implementers, trade allies, consumer advocates, and community-based organizations.
Working with stakeholders, we will conduct a series of workshops and interviews to develop a roadmap for utilities and regulators to reengineer their efficiency programs, policies, pricing, and procurement to align with the climate challenge, and we will provide technical assistance to facilitate the transformation. We have no time to waste.

What is your favorite energy-efficient item in your home?
I have a new high-efficiency washing machine and I love it. In addition to using less water, it has extra spin cycles so everything dries faster, making it easier to hang clothes to dry. Skipping the dryer saves energy and is gentler on my clothes.   
What’s the most surprising thing you’ve learned working at ACEEE? 
I have learned all kinds of interesting things—how to drive more efficiently, heat and cool my home more efficiently, wash dishes more efficiently, etc. One surprise to me: I didn’t understand that ceiling fans don’t cool down a room. They just make you feel cooler, so there is no point in keeping them on if you aren’t in the room.
  Mariel Wolfson, editor
What first got you interested in energy efficiency work?
When I was writing my dissertation, I learned that the push for energy-efficient homes in the 1970s played a huge role in the “discovery” of indoor air pollution in the 1980s. Then I became very interested in energy-efficient buildings and energy efficiency in general. Being energy efficient is a no-brainer!
Tell us one small way that you’re becoming more energy efficient.
I’ve been doing all my laundry in cold water for the last year, and I don’t notice any difference from warm or hot water.
  Carolin Tolentino, Roger Arliner Young clean energy fellow
What first got you interested in energy efficiency work?
My first internship with Urban Green Council, where I helped with their energy code courses and got to audit one myself. That summer, I also went to a Passive House conference and found the houses super cool and innovative. It’s my dream to live in one someday!
What is one thing that our readers can do within the next 24 hours to reduce energy use in their own lives?
Unplug appliances that aren’t being used. It becomes routine pretty quickly and can save hundreds in utility bills.
  Lowell Ungar, director of the federal policy program
What is your favorite energy-efficient item in your home?
My clothes drying rack—it uses no energy. Same for the dish rack and for opening windows when the weather is good. But my ground-source heat pump also keeps energy bills under $60 all year round.
What first got you interested in energy efficiency work?
When thinking about how I could make a difference on air pollution and global warming, it seemed like energy efficiency was having a big impact but was barely on the policy radar in Washington, D.C.
  Wendy Koch, senior director of marketing and communications
What is your favorite energy-efficient item in your home?
My ceiling fans. We have one in every major room, and they reduce our use of air conditioning. If you buy one with a light, make sure it’s ENERGY STAR®-certified and uses an LED.
Tell us something we might not know about your background in energy work.
I got started in this field because my family wanted to move from what my husband called our BAH (big a— house). We ended up building a right-sized, energy-efficient home in a walkable neighborhood. I was a USA TODAY journalist at the time and blogged about the experience.
  Reuven Sussman, director of the behavior and human dimensions program
What is your favorite fun fact about energy efficiency?
Even though energy efficiency can save folks money, sometimes the most convincing reasons to install energy upgrades are health and comfort. The most environmentally impactful actions are often done for non-environmental reasons.
What is one thing that our readers can do within the next 24 hours to reduce energy use in their own lives?
I think the best thing people can do is sign up to volunteer with an environmental organization. This is a great gateway to making larger changes in society and in one’s own life—and it’s fun! Working together, people can have more influence than individually, and with shared accountability, they also feel more motivated to follow through with their own energy efficiency goals.
  Sagarika Subramanian, researcher for the state policy program
Tell us one small way that you’re becoming more energy efficient.
As we approach the summer, I’ve started to cook recipes that don’t require using the oven, which saves energy and avoids higher room temperatures.
What is your favorite fun fact about energy efficiency (or your area of research)?
My recent work on intelligent efficiency has demonstrated the enormous potential that smart technologies have to reduce energy use among a variety of sectors. For example, ACEEE analysis shows that smart technologies could reduce energy use by up to 18% in commercial buildings. One day I hope to own a smart thermostat to optimize my energy use, cut down on energy costs, and finally participate in a demand response program!
  Nora Wang Esram, senior director for research
What is one thing that our readers can do within the next 24 hours to reduce energy use in their own lives?
I always feel guilty about yelling at Alexa to turn on/off lights. One Google search is equal to turning on a 60W light bulb for 17 seconds. Whether carbon offsets are enough to qualify the information and communications technology industry as environmentally friendly remains a topic of debate. I am NOT suggesting we go back to the pre-Internet era, but we should certainly reduce mindless internet browsing and teach our kids what a light switch is. The non-energy benefits are that you burn more calories and enjoy your life better.

Report: Utilities Can Lessen Winter Power Outage Risk by Investing in Home Efficiency;"Washington, DC—A large-scale shift toward electric-powered heating is set to raise wintertime power demand, but utilities can cost effectively mitigate spikes and ensure reliability by investing in energy-saving measures in homes, a new report finds. The report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) shows how utilities’ investments to weatherize homes, improve the efficiency of heating, and optimize the timing of energy use can help tackle cold-weather electricity challenges.

Watch the report launch webinar
Increased use of electric heating—vital for reducing greenhouse gas emissions—is expected to cause peak electricity demand in the winter for many more utilities. Even in “summer-peaking” regions, surges in electric demand during increasingly frequent extreme cold weather events can contribute to fuel price spikes or outages, such as occurred in the recent Texas disaster.
While utilities can meet winter peaks and other cold-weather demand constraints by building more power plants, energy efficiency measures have significant untapped potential to reduce winter demand, generally in ways that would be more cost effective, the report finds.
“Spikes in cold-weather power demand are a real concern if everything is running on electricity, but it’s a solvable problem. We wouldn’t want utilities to have to build new power plants that are often dirtier and more expensive, and if we get this right, they won’t have to,” said Mike Specian, lead author of the report and utilities program manager at ACEEE. “Utilities are ultimately responsible for delivering electricity reliably, and offering programs to encourage these upgrades in homes will help them do that.”
The ACEEE report modeled the impacts of measures to reduce electricity demand in the New England states during a simulated four-day polar vortex in 2040. Researchers examined this region because it not only faces cold temperatures but also is expected to see a significant shift toward electrified heating to meet ambitious climate goals.
ACEEE found that better-sealed homes, higher-performing heat pumps, and grid-interactive measures like water-heating systems that heat water at lower-demand times could reduce winter peak by up to 12%. Adding a more aggressive but plausible set of measures—including deep retrofits, smarter commercial HVAC controls, and energy information management systems—would reduce peak demand during such a vortex by up to 34%. These reductions reflect changes to residential loads and key commercial loads like space heating, water heating, ventilation, and lighting.
New England load profile during simulated 2040 polar vortex event before and after applying package of deep demand-side management measures (profile reflects all residential loads and “conventional” commercial loads).
The report finds that residential weatherization and use of more-efficient heat pump models are the most important measures, with relative importance varying based on the specific scenario. In addition to smart controls, the report recommends demand-response measures involving grid-interactive water heaters, managed electric vehicle charging, and behind-the-meter battery systems. Its findings suggest limited fossil fuel backup in homes could further reduce the amount of electricity needed to deal with the most intense winter peak events.
Utilities have numerous programs to help customers make energy-saving upgrades, with far more focusing on reducing summer peaks rather than winter peaks. The report highlights utility programs aimed at reducing winter demand and makes recommendations based on lessons learned from them.
The report calls on state policymakers and regulators to set utility goals for reducing winter peak demand and consider demand-side solutions for meeting it. It recommends that utilities and other administrators of efficiency programs adapt existing programs to incorporate technologies and measures that reduce winter peak demand as well as expand weatherization and home retrofit funding

Biden’s Plan Needs These Bold Measures to Better Tackle the Climate Crisis;"As we recently noted, President Joe Biden’s proposed jobs and infrastructure plan includes unprecedented investments to address climate change, in part through energy efficiency. So far, the proposal is high level, with many details still to be spelled out. Such details will be important to set the United States on a course to meet climate targets as well as economic and equity goals. As these details are developed, we recommend the plan include several key programs to save energy and money while reducing emissions. Four important ones are weatherizing more low- and moderate-income homes, incentives to replace diesel trucks with electric ones, incentives to use energy management in factories, and funding for scaling up transformative industrial technologies. 
On Earth Day, April 22, the president is convening a summit at which the administration is likely to announce a new U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions goal. Media reports suggest that the new goal is likely to be around a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, relative to 2005 levels. To help achieve these ambitious reductions, the administration and Congress should include the following measures in the infrastructure package.
Buildings
The Biden administration has proposed to build, preserve, and protect more than 2 million homes and commercial buildings. This includes building new affordable housing, rehabilitating public housing, renovating schools, and other initiatives for which details are not yet known. All new homes and major renovations should be built to high efficiency standards to avoid locking in energy waste and high carbon emissions.
In addition, we recommend a major investment in energy improvements, especially for affordable housing: a large increase in the number of low-income housing units weatherized through the Weatherization Assistance Program, funding the Hope for Homes initiative to retrofit other homes (including doubled incentives for moderate-income families), and funding the Green, Resilient, Efficient, and Affordable Homes for Tenants (GREAHT) program for multifamily housing developed jointly by ACEEE and the National Housing Trust. 
Overall, we suggest retrofitting at least 20 million housing units over 10 years. To lay the groundwork for long-term decarbonization efforts, we recommend providing incentives for high-efficiency electric and gas heat pumps and for constructing highly efficient homes and buildings that are zero-energy ready.
Transportation
The infrastructure plan includes large investments in public transit, the U.S. rail system, electric vehicles (EVs) and EV charging infrastructure. These incentives should include replacing highly polluting diesel trucks with electric and fuel-cell medium- and heavy-duty trucks. A variety of electric trucks are now entering the market and incentives could help them establish a foothold. In addition, while President Biden has committed to the construction of 500,000 EV charging stations, investments in charging infrastructure will need to be scaled up even further to achieve his ambitious GHG and EV deployment targets. In particular, bus, truck, and other fleets need assistance with installing chargers and associated power grid equipment.
Industry
The president’s proposal calls for research and development (R&D) and other investments to revitalize manufacturing. It includes upgrading America’s research infrastructure, advancing U.S. leadership in critical technologies, developing new methods for reducing emissions and building climate resilience, and retooling and revitalizing American manufacturers and small businesses. Details are not yet available.
As part of these initiatives, we recommend including three proposals that ACEEE has developed. We explain our proposals in fact sheets published today:
1. enhancing energy management at small, medium, and large factories.
2. co-funding the first three commercial-scale installations of transformative carbon-reducing industrial technologies.
3. funding a competitive solicitation to assist regional manufacturing clusters in addressing common supply chain and decarbonization needs.
Power Sector
The infrastructure proposal includes an Energy Efficiency and Clean Energy Standard to reduce power sector GHG emissions to approximately zero by 2035. This will result in large energy savings and emissions reductions; we strongly support such a standard. In our view, the standard needs to build on decades of success with state energy efficiency requirements, but working out the details and building political support will take effort and time.  
The Path Forward
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has said that she wants the House of Representatives to pass a bill by July 4th. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), chair of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, has said he wants to develop the transportation sections of a bill in May. Although Democrats are hoping to pass bipartisan legislation, the Senate parliamentarian has indicated that senators can use the budget reconciliation process to pass further tax and spending legislation with only 50 votes. ACEEE has begun an analysis of the energy, GHG, and jobs impacts of various provisions up for consideration, which will help inform discussions on the infrastructure package. Stay tuned for this analysis and associated blog post.

Study: Few States and Utilities Ensure Equity in Electric Vehicle Charging Investments;"Programs Should Engage and Serve Low- and Moderate-Income Households and Communities of Color
Washington, DC—As more utilities invest ratepayer funds to support and expand electric vehicle charging infrastructure, few states and power companies ensure equitable distribution of these funds, a new study finds. In fact, an analysis by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) shows that only six of 36 states evaluated have some form of equity mandate or consideration, such as requiring a certain share of funds be invested in low and moderate-income (LMI) communities and communities of color. It finds that utilities’ investments in underserved communities have been concentrated so far in only a handful of states.
Read the White Paper
Many electric vehicles already cost less to own than their gasoline counterparts, thanks to far lower fueling and maintenance costs, and prices are expected to drop further. But access to vehicle charging remains a key barrier, and companies that invest in charging infrastructure have focused on higher-income areas. As a result, low- and moderate-income communities could have less access to electric transportation options for years to come and be stuck paying higher costs. Insufficient charging could also leave them and communities of color continuing to face disproportionate air pollution from personal vehicles, trucks, and busses that are not electrified.
“As electric vehicles become more ubiquitous, we need a much more proactive effort to ensure that low-income communities and communities of color have access to charging and directly benefit,” said Peter Huether, ACEEE’s senior research analyst for transportation and author of the study. “State legislators and utility regulators need to set equity requirements, and utilities need to engage communities to create programs that serve everyone.”
The study, arriving as President Biden looks to enact an agenda that supports EVs, argues that policymakers and utilities must help fill these gaps to ensure equitable access. Increasingly, electric utilities are making plans to invest ratepayer funds in EV charging, including in “make-ready” upgrades to prepare sites for third parties to install charging equipment, incentives for homeowners or buildings owners to install chargers, and utility-owned charging sites and supporting equipment. For his part, Biden has pledged to invest in 500,000 EV charging stations and devote 40% of clean energy funding to disadvantaged communities.
The vast majority of charging investments from investor-owned utilities so far have been in two states that have equity mandates. California law requires that at least 35% of utilities’ funding for charging equipment go toward underserved communities; New York’s Public Service Commission ordered utilities to invest in charging with special considerations for LMI and environmental justice communities. ACEEE finds that at least $646 million of $2.4 billion in charging investments, which are primarily in these two states, has been earmarked for underserved communities (ACEEE reviewed programs from 78 major investor-owned utilities).
The study also finds that only 31 of 61 regulator-approved plans examined in the study listed a community engagement effort for these investments, which varied widely from posting a website to conducting a needs assessment. The study recommends how utilities preparing to begin such programs can engage communities to ensure the investments better meet the needs and priorities of community residents.
“Without strong policies in place, you could see a big round of ratepayer-funded charging investments going disproportionately to communities that least need the support,” said Huether. “All utilities considering vehicle charging programs should begin with robust community engagement to ensure their investments deliver on community needs.”
The study highlights three case studies on utility programs, including the community engagement efforts of Puget Sound Energy, which partnered with low-income assistance agencies to propose to regulators three pilot programs for EV charging. The utility engaged with nonprofits, government agencies, community service organizations, private mobility organizations, policy advocates, and nonprofit organizations before working to develop pilot project plans.
ACEEE’s study provides guidance for utilities and program administrators implementing vehicle charging programs, including calling on them to:
Initiate community engagement early in the planning process to identify problems, set goals, receive feedback, and build trust with community members.
Set aside funding for LMI and underserved communities, if not already doing so
Use investments to increase clean mobility options in LMI communities as well as to provide the ability to charge medium- and heavy-duty vehicles operating in environmental justice communities.
ACEEE will draw on these recommendations for a working group it hosts to help utilities that are administering, developing, or considering EV charging programs achieve equitable outcomes.

DOE Proposes to Undo Trump-Era Roadblocks for Updating Appliance Standards;"Washington, DC—The Biden administration announced a proposed rule that, if finalized, could help update energy-saving standards for dozens of types of appliances and equipment, such as refrigerators and furnaces. The proposal from the Department of Energy (DOE) this week would undo key provisions of a Trump administration rule that had set roadblocks for updating these popular standards, which are mandated by Congress.
“This rule will pave the way for the department to set strong standards that slash greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “Without this move the department could get hopelessly stuck in the quicksand of the restrictive process set by the previous administration.”
More than 80% of registered voters favor updating appliance standards, including nearly two-thirds of conservative Republicans—for good reason. A series of such standards could save the average American household $230 annually on utility bills by 2035 and cut carbon emissions over the next 3 decades by an amount equivalent to eliminating at least 13 coal-fired power plants, according to an ACEEE/ASAP report published in November 2020.
Yet, as of Inauguration Day this year, DOE had missed 28 legal deadlines for considering new standards. By January 2025, another 19 will come due, meaning that the new administration has 4 years to consider updating standards for 47 products.
“This administration arrived facing the double whammy of dozens of standards already overdue and an unnecessary obstacle course set out in front of it,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP). “This news is another encouraging sign that the administration is acting with the urgency needed to move us toward energy-saving technologies.”
The Trump administration’s “Process Rule,” finalized in 2020, added more time-consuming steps to DOE’s already lengthy standard-setting process. It prohibited the department from updating the standard for a product unless the change would save at least 0.3 quadrillion Btu of energy at the site of its use, which translates to about $11 billion in electricity costs for electric products. It allowed manufacturers to largely design the testing that determines whether a product meets standards. And it did not leave any leeway or discretion for DOE in following its mandates, opening any standard completed by the department to major litigation threats.
The new proposed rule would remove several of these key hurdles. It would return the Process Rule to nonbinding guidance status, eliminate the strict minimum energy savings threshold for DOE to set a standard, loosen the requirements to adhere to manufacturer-developed testing procedures, and reinstate the potential for a stakeholder negotiation process that enables more-rapid standard setting in some instances. It would also eliminate a requirement to conduct a comparative analysis of potential standards that conflicts with statute and a mandatory 180-day waiting period between a test procedure final rule and a proposal for a new standard.
President Biden had ordered DOE in a January 20 executive order to consider proposing “major revisions” to the Process Rule by this month and “any remaining revisions” by June.

Biden Plan Sets Strong Starting Point for Transforming Outdated Infrastructure;"Washington, DC—The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released the following statement from Steven Nadel, its executive director, in response to President Biden’s announcement of his infrastructure plan:
“This sweeping plan is an excellent starting point for transforming our infrastructure to create jobs, increase equity, and enable a low-carbon future. President Biden campaigned on many of these smart ideas, and today he has followed through to press for making them law.”
“Biden’s plan includes major efficiency investments that would cut carbon emissions and the energy costs that are such a challenge for many families and businesses. Congress should build on these ideas.”
“Too much of today’s outdated infrastructure just doesn’t work for us. We live and work in buildings that waste energy and often risk health and productivity; we use inefficient vehicles that often provide poor mobility choices or unreliable freight movement; and we have underinvested in our industrial plants and workers, at times making us vulnerable to foreign competitors and disruptions in global supply chains. We’ve made progress, but we’re still not close to the investment we need to avert a climate catastrophe. At our current pace, it would take half a millennium to retrofit all houses and multifamily buildings to cut their energy use, and that’s time we don’t have.”
“This plan would be a big step toward meeting our economic and climate challenges. Congress will need to flesh it out and go further. It should incentivize the purchase of electric trucks to take the heaviest polluters off the road, and it should seek to build even more charging stations. It should invest in additional transformative technologies to improve competitiveness and reduce carbon emissions in our industrial sector. And it should provide grants and rebates for millions of energy retrofits, including in low- and moderate-income multifamily and single-family homes.”
The Biden administration’s plan calls for increased investments in underserved communities, including $100 billion in targeted workforce development programs. It features numerous energy-saving policies across several sectors, including:
Buildings:
Produce, preserve, and retrofit a million affordable, energy-efficient housing units; build and rehabilitate 500,000 housing units for low- and middle-income homebuyers; invest $40 billion to improve the energy efficiency and safety of public housing; extend and expand tax credits to spur efficiency improvements in homes and commercial buildings.
Invest $100 billion to upgrade and build public schools, including energy efficiency upgrades.
Transportation:
Invest $85 billion in public transit and $80 billion in rail.
Invest $174 billion in electric vehicles, including through rebates and tax incentives; build a network of 500,000 vehicle chargers.
Address historic inequities, including by investing $20 billion in reconnecting neighborhoods cut off by past infrastructure.
Industry:
Invest $135 billion in R&D to improve industrial competitiveness and reduce sector emissions.
Invest $218 billion to modernize and decarbonize American manufacturing.
Power Sector:
Establish an energy efficiency and clean electricity standard to cut energy bills and shift toward zero-carbon energy sources.

Massachusetts Steps Up Energy-Saving Policies in Major Climate Law;"Sets Appliance Efficiency Standards and Sets Path for Strong Building Codes
In a far-reaching climate bill scheduled to be signed today, Massachusetts commits to halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, while embracing new energy-saving policies to help achieve the targets. The law sets efficiency standards for 17 residential and commercial products and directs the state government to develop a stringent building code that municipalities may adopt to dramatically cut energy waste in new homes and buildings.
“Reducing our total energy use is a key step in tackling climate change. These efficiency standards are going to cut needless energy waste and most households and businesses won’t even notice until they see lower bills,” said Marianne DiMascio, state policy manager for the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP). “Local advocates and lawmakers persisted for years to get these standards done. Representative Josh Cutler and Senator Jason Lewis deserve tremendous credit for sponsoring this key provision.”
Slated to be signed by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, the law sets efficiency standards for products including computers, water coolers, and commercial cooking equipment. The standards will save Massachusetts consumers and businesses more than $100 million on their utility bills in 2025 alone, with greater savings each year as consumers purchase more efficient products. By 2025, they will cut carbon dioxide emissions by an amount equivalent to taking 24,000 cars off the road. Massachusetts is the 9th state or jurisdiction to adopt appliance efficiency standards since 2017.
The law also aims to strengthen building codes to make new homes and buildings more energy efficient. It directs the state’s Department of Energy Resources to develop a “stretch” energy code for net-zero energy buildings, which municipalities could choose to adopt.
“Massachusetts is setting a leading path forward on climate for others to join. We’re going to need more states to step up to this level, quickly,” said Bryan Howard, state policy director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “Moving toward building codes that ensure new buildings use zero net energy is critical, especially because most buildings are around for decades or more. Developing a strong code that enables municipalities to go net zero will be critical for the Department of Energy Resources now.”
The law also includes important provisions to better ensure that strategies for reducing emissions are equitable:
Directs the Department of Public Utilities to consider equity as it works to meet state greenhouse gas reduction targets.
Orders the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center to create a clean energy equity workforce and market development program to support employment opportunities for certified minority- and women-owned small business and individuals living in environmental justice communities.
Establishes protections for low- and moderate-income individuals and environmental justice populations in meeting emissions reduction plans.
The law mandates the development of interim targets for adopting energy-saving technologies and implementation plans to meet them, including deployment goals for electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging stations, and air-source heat pumps.
Massachusetts scored second place in ACEEE’s most recent State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, published in December 2020. The state had been the top scorer or tied for the top score the previous nine years.

How Federal R&D Should Expand to Transform our Buildings;"[Ed. note: Dr. Esram is testifying today before the U.S. House’s Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in a hearing on Building Technologies Research for a Sustainable Future. This blog post draws from her testimony.]
To quickly retrofit a large share of our buildings—a critical step for cutting greenhouse gas emissions—we need federal research and development. The Biden administration and Congress can expand this R&D to develop integrated technologies, create ways to incorporate them in buildings, and support the workforce in an increasingly high-tech field.
Building efficiency technologies have proven a win-win strategy for reducing energy costs and creating local jobs. But the biggest opportunities are still ahead: Our research reveals that improving the efficiency of buildings has the potential to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by nearly 20%. That would be a transformative pillar for meeting our ambitious carbon reductions goals.
These technologies can deliver more than the sum of their parts
Replacing lights, water heaters, or HVAC systems, or adding insulation, can each reduce a building’s GHG emission by a few percent, which seems small and incremental. But these components can add up to even more than the sum of their parts. For instance, when a building is well insulated, its lights are efficient, and its room temperatures well controlled, it needs a much smaller HVAC system to provide heating and cooling. And a building owner who decides to take the next step and go net-zero energy can invest in a much smaller photovoltaic system and less-expensive battery storage.
Retrofits can mitigate public health threats
Building retrofits not only save energy and reduce carbon emissions, but they also improve occupants’ health, comfort, and productivity, as well as community resilience. And we need that because today, many of our buildings aren't serving us well. For instance, when COVID-19 hit, public health experts suggested increasing indoor ventilation and filtration to reduce virus transmission risk. But many legacy building systems can’t handle that. When offices were sitting empty during the lockdown, they still consumed 40-100% of their usual energy. That’s a waste!
It took a pandemic to alert us that many schools need major renovation to keep our kids safer and healthier. And when the power went out across much of Texas, many poorly insulated homes quickly dropped to near-freezing temperatures. Imagine if these houses could have been kept warm during the blackouts with a heating device as small as a hair dryer when the winter storm hit. That’s not a dream. That’s passive-house technology.
Thanks to decades of federal investment in buildings R&D, we have many technologies available to make buildings efficient, healthier, and resilient for all. We know how to build zero-energy buildings, but we don’t know yet how to expeditiously retrofit existing buildings. When I worked at a national lab, my team and I modeled thousands of commercial buildings—all real buildings—and found that, on average, these buildings could reduce their energy use by 20% simply with efficiency measures that would pay for themselves. To realize these savings, we need a more innovative process for turning energy models into retrofit actions and a stronger-than-ever workforce.
Increase productivity in construction to promote deep retrofits
Improving productivity in the building construction industry can simultaneously expand the reach of deep retrofits and create jobs. If construction labor productivity were to catch up with the progress made by other sectors, there would be a $1.6 trillion economic gain globally. A third of that opportunity is in the United States. Many countries are moving some on-site construction to a manufacturing-inspired mass-production platform.
The U.S. construction industry will be left behind if we do not take initiative. We need to use lean manufacturing principles to streamline onsite retrofits to reduce costs and shorten project time. The construction industry is eager to transform, and we can’t afford to miss the opportune time to integrate low-lifecycle-carbon and high-resilience technical solutions with efficient manufacture and assembly design.
Retool the workforce and inspire a new generation of building leaders
A strong and creative workforce is key to success. On the one hand, we need to support today’s workers, equipping the specialized trades and contractors with knowledge and skills to use the latest equipment and tools to build, renovate, and operate buildings. Many of them are the first line of support for building owners. We need to help them gain a competitive edge. On the other hand, we should educate and attract a new generation of innovators and entrepreneurs. Buildings of the future are not just shelters made of bricks and mortar; they are machines that interact with the electric grid and vehicles.
Workforce development is a creative and interactive process. We need federal support and the science community to help grow tomorrow’s building leaders outside of the classroom.
Stepped up federal R&D can support the transformation of buildings
Congress should direct and support DOE to deploy its R&D capabilities to lay a solid foundation that sustains a successful transformation of the building industry as follows: (1) Spur modernized approaches to accelerate deep energy retrofits and create jobs; (2) Train and diversify our workforce and inspire a new generation of leaders; (3) Drive enduring market transformation through integration of efficiency R&D with health, resilience, and other societal goals; (4) Last, but not least, collaborate with state and local governments and community-based organizations to create proactive, replicable solutions for all. DOE should support these governments to lead by example, improving efficiency, health, and resilience in public housing, public schools, and other publicly owned or leased facilities.
I truly believe that we are facing a paradigm shift in our buildings and they energy they use. The Department of Energy can and must work to expand its R&D efforts to help enable this transition.

Biden Needs to Set Strong Clean Car Standards;"The Biden administration can reclaim lost momentum on reducing automotive greenhouse gas emissions by setting clean car standards that catch up to those set by President Obama and ensuring the program achieves real-world benefits. These standards should be substantially stronger than those agreed to in a deal between California and some manufacturers during the last administration, which are not stringent enough.
The president got off to a quick start, issuing an executive order on his first day in office directing regulators to consider undoing both the Trump administration’s fuel economy and emissions standards rollback and its rule blocking California from setting its own standards. Few doubt that the Biden administration will fully restore California’s authority and the ability for other states to again adopt its standards.
Now eyes are on what the Biden administration will do to rescue the federal vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards the Trump administration rolled back in March 2020. Some observers suggest that an agreement California reached with four automakers in 2019, adopted through a memorandum of understanding (MOU), could be the basis for any new federal vehicle standards through model year 2026.
The California MOU was a response to the two Trump administration rules. The five car companies that signed the MOU agreed to follow standards falling between the Obama and Trump administrations’ standards in stringency. The California agreement played a crucial role keeping clean vehicle technology development moving in the United States while highlighting the folly of a regulatory rollback that the industry itself couldn’t justify. (Nearly all of the automakers had once supported the Obama administration’s rules.)
At this pivotal moment, however, we need standards that go further than the California agreement and usher in a swift transition to more efficient and much lower-emitting vehicles. Both the urgency and the feasibility of this transition are more evident today than they were just a few years ago. The Obama administration’s standard required a 4.7% annual rate of improvement, whereas the California deal requires 3.7% yearly progress. To catch up to the Obama plan, the Biden administration would need to mandate faster improvement than 4.7% in the initial years of the new rule, especially because it cannot go into effect immediately. This is not only economically achievable with current technology, but also vital if the Biden administration is to achieve its own greenhouse gas emissions goals, indicated by rejoining the Paris Agreement.
Recent trends in vehicle fuel economy underscore the importance of going beyond the ambition of the Obama standards. An EPA report released in January showed that the fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions of new passenger vehicles have improved an average of just 1.4% per year since 2012; in fact, in 2019, the latest year for which final data are available, vehicle performance worsened. This happened in a period in which fuel economy standards nominally required substantial, steady improvement.
The problem lies in many features of these regulatory programs designed to increase manufacturer flexibility. For instance, standards self-adjust to changes in the size distribution of the vehicles sold, and the market’s multiyear shift toward SUVs and other larger vehicles has therefore seriously eroded progress toward a low-emissions vehicle fleet. The Biden administration’s standards should set a backstop on average fuel economy of all new vehicles sold each year, regardless of the size mix, to ensure an adequate rate of emissions reductions going forward.
Tighten up the program to deliver real progress
The Biden administration should also carefully consider other features of the standards. The treatment of electric vehicles (EVs) and “off-cycle” credits are two important issues. The California MOU allows manufacturers to meet up to 1% of the required 3.7% per year emissions reductions by giving extra weight to EVs in calculating automakers’ average emissions. These EV “multipliers,” along with the treatment of EVs as zero emissions vehicles, are extensions of temporary incentives in the Obama standards intended to jump start EV production. But counting each fully electric vehicle as 1.5 or 2 zero emissions vehicles will allow automakers to sell more high-emitting conventional vehicles, increasing their true average emissions rates beyond the levels set by the standards.
ACEEE calculated that, because of this, the California MOU would preserve only 65% of the emissions reduction benefit of the Obama administration’s standards over the covered model years, rather than the 79% that the 3.7% annual improvement would suggest. Moreover, many of the EVs that will generate the extra 1% emissions reductions on paper would be produced whether or not these incentives are in place. The Biden administration can avoid this loss in benefits by returning to the Obama rule EV provisions, rather than following the MOU.  
The California agreement also makes it easier for manufacturers to get emissions reduction credit for off-cycle technologies (i.e. technologies with benefits that are not adequately captured in standard fuel economy testing). The MOU increases by 50% the total number of such off-cycle credits that can be earned from a set menu of technology options and also commits California to a “streamlined” process for reviewing manufacturers’ credit requests. Whether these off-cycle technologies deliver extra emissions reductions commensurate with the credits they are awarded has been a subject of debate for some time, and the full review process is vital in ensuring the integrity of the program. Moreover, emerging automation and connectivity technologies raise difficult new questions about how to determine the effectiveness of off-cycle technologies in reducing emissions.
ACEEE estimates that if this expedited review process leads to an increase in undeserved credits, the emissions reduction benefits of the MOU could turn out to be only half that of the Obama standards. The administration should avoid any changes to off-cycle credit provisions that could undermine the rigor of the program.
Drive the technology transition over the coming decade
The Biden administration has made the right call in deciding to revisit the Trump administration’s light duty vehicle emissions rules and should reinstitute or improve upon the Obama era rules as quickly as possible. Weaker standards are not justified when technology, such as electrification, has moved faster than forecasted, when the Obama rule was developed, and automakers have already invested in meeting those earlier standards.
The administration cannot stop at reimposing the Obama era standards. Current fuel economy standards go out only to MY 2026. Standards for subsequent years must be drafted promptly and put forward for public review. These standards should not only ensure that the efficiency of internal combustion engine vehicles continues to improve, but also drive the rapid electrification of light-duty vehicles sold in the United States to approach 100% of new vehicle sales by 2035, similar to California’s more recent EV sales mandates.

Grid Operators Can Seize Efficiency Opportunity in FERC's Distributed Resources Order;"Electric grid operators have a promising opportunity to use energy efficiency to boost grid reliability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce system costs. By early summer, they are required by a recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order to propose a new set of rules for deploying efficiency to meet grid demand alongside power plants, storage, and demand response. But to optimize this opportunity, they need to get the rules right.
Energy efficiency already contributes to some wholesale markets
FERC’s decision, known formally as Order 2222, concerns wholesale markets, where utilities and grid operators purchase energy and services for resale to customers. In wholesale markets, energy efficiency improvements (in commercial buildings, for example) are well positioned to offer capacity services—meaning they can reduce the amount of electric power needed to meet a region’s demand at a particular moment in time. These services are purchased at auction in what are known as capacity markets. Of the seven wholesale market operators in the United States, four have capacity markets subject to FERC’s jurisdiction: ISO New England (ISO-NE), PJM, Midcontinent ISO (MISO), and New York ISO (NYISO).
Energy efficiency efforts have already delivered capacity value in ISO-NE and PJM, which cover New England and the Mid-Atlantic states, for more than a decade. During this time, efficiency’s role in providing capacity has grown in both absolute and relative terms. In 2020–21, about 1600 MW (1.1%) of PJM capacity procured at auction will come from energy efficiency, while for ISO-NE that amount is more than 2700 MW (7.5%). Energy efficiency can also participate in MISO’s voluntary capacity auction, where it represents 0.5% of capacity in 2020-21. The result has been lower overall capacity costs, which translates to lower electric rates for customers.
New opportunities
Prior to FERC Order 2222, approved in September 2020, wholesale market operators could, at their discretion, allow energy efficiency to participate in capacity auctions. But the Order sends an important message: Where energy efficiency is capable of providing services to the market, wholesale market operators must allow it to do so. It firmly establishes the right for efficiency providers to be compensated for the benefits they offer to wholesale markets, thereby making efficiency more likely to be procured if its value can be monetized.
This introduces new opportunities. Until now, NYISO has not allowed energy efficiency to participate in capacity auctions. Order 2222 should compel NYISO to develop new wholesale market rules that allow energy efficiency to participate.
In addition to introducing new opportunities for energy efficiency, Order 2222 also removes existing barriers for other aggregated customer-sited resources to participate in wholesale energy markets. This includes behind-the-meter resources like rooftop solar, battery systems, and demand response. These resources can provide additional value to the grid—like energy and ancillary services—that energy efficiency does not provide.
However, the distinct characteristics of these other distributed energy resources (DERs) should not impose more requirements on efficiency than are strictly necessary. For example, while a full accounting of location, metering, and telemetry might be necessary for aggregators or grid operators to manage a DER like behind-the-meter solar PV, energy efficiency is relatively simple (e.g., always on, cannot overload a feeder). Attaching unnecessary obligations to energy efficiency could reduce the resource’s value in the eyes of providers or limit its participation altogether. Grid operators should avoid such restrictions on energy efficiency in their revised tariffs.
Wholesale market operators hold keys in next steps
Each of the market operators has until July to draft so-called tariff provisions that lay out how it intends to comply with Order 2222. Managing DERs introduces a series of challenges, and operators must decide how they will allow aggregations of these DERs to participate. This includes establishing a minimum size requirement and addressing issues related to location, bidding, data, metering, and telemetry, as well as numerous elements of coordination among the operators, DER aggregator, distribution utility, and the relevant electric retail regulatory authorities.
While there may be some unique circumstances in which energy efficiency can interact with other DERs (e.g., a more-efficient thermal envelope enhancing the ability of space heating measures to provide demand flexibility), wholesale market operators should allow energy efficiency to stand on its own merits. For example, FERC Order 719 allows states to opt out of a requirement to allow demand response to participate in wholesale markets. If aggregations containing both energy efficiency and demand response, such as efficient grid-interactive water heaters, are allowed to qualify under this provision, opting out of the latter risks taking the former out with it.
As wholesale market operators prepare their tariff provisions, they have an opportunity to ensure that these new rules work for energy efficiency, and that it be allowed to fully participate on its own merits. Stakeholders and wholesale market operators can build on the success of energy efficiency in NE-ISO and PJM’s capacity markets to ensure electric customers get the benefits of energy efficiency as a resource.

Biden, States Kick Off Pivotal Year for Appliance Efficiency Standards;"With the Biden administration in its second month, we have already seen its interest in strengthening the energy-saving standards that cover dozens of household and commercial products, such as furnaces, refrigerators, and light bulbs. The new administration has staffed up with climate and clean energy leaders and initiated work to undo the previous administration’s slew of harmful rules.
Meanwhile, at the state level, momentum for new standards covering a range of energy- and water-using products is surging; a dozen states have legislation or rulemakings pending.
This one-two combination of federal and state action means that 2021 is shaping up as a big year for progress on new efficiency standards—progress that will contribute significantly to meeting climate and clean energy goals.
Biden administration off to a good start
On his first day in office, President Biden issued the “Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.” He directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to propose major revisions to the “Process Rule” that governs how the agency develops new appliance standards. Initial proposed changes are due this month (DOE sent the White House a draft proposal for review last week) and any remaining cleanup is due by June. We expect the Biden team will eliminate a series of roadblocks and hurdles to future efficiency standards that the previous administration created in its rewrite of the rule.
The order also directed agencies to list actions taken during the previous administration that conflict with the Biden administration’s climate policy and consider “suspending, revising or rescinding” them. DOE submitted a list of 13 rules late last month. In addition to the Process Rule, the list includes rules that scaled back and overturned light bulb standards; weakened dishwasher, clothes washer, and dryer standards; allowed for multi-head showerheads that could use unlimited amounts of water; permitted manufacturers to self-waive test procedure requirements; and withdrew Obama-era proposed rules for furnaces and commercial water heaters and set barriers to strong future standards for these products. (Most of the 13 final actions are also subject to ongoing litigation brought by states and environmental and consumer groups.)
President Biden’s staffing choices for DOE are as promising as the early policy moves. Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who was recently confirmed on a bipartisan basis, Acting Undersecretary for Science and Energy Kathleen Hogan, and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Kelly Speakes-Backman (currently serving as the Acting Assistant Secretary) are proven climate and clean energy leaders.
Fifty standards in four years
The new leadership has its work cut out for it. Clearing away the damage of the past four years is a critical start. Catching up on overdue deadlines for updating standards and meeting upcoming ones is an even bigger challenge. As of Inauguration Day, DOE had missed 28 legal deadlines for considering new standards. By January 2025, another 19 will come due. Some of the biggest savings opportunities include water heaters, furnaces, air conditioners and heat pumps, clothes dryers, refrigerators, and electric motors. But a collection of smaller opportunities (e.g., battery chargers, dehumidifiers, ice makers) add up to big savings, too.
DOE should not stop there. Work on several product categories initiated during the Obama years that are not subject to any specific legal deadline should be restarted (e.g., circulator pumps, commercial and industrial fans). One way DOE can score a quick efficiency win is by publishing a pool pump motor rule needed to close a loophole in standards that take effect in July. The previous administration proposed making this rule voluntary; DOE should make the final rule binding. Other candidates for new standards include products such as air purifiers that are included in ASAP’s model state standards legislation.
Altogether, DOE should update or establish standards for about 50 products (and a similar number of test procedures) within the next four years. That’s what’s needed to comply with the law, given the past four years of no progress. For perspective, the Obama administration updated about 50 standards too, but over eight years.
State momentum builds
States that upped their climate game to fill the void of federal leadership during the past four years show no signs of abating interest. Generally, states can set standards for products outside the scope of the federal program. They can also require that plumbing products such as showerheads and faucets meet stronger standards than the outdated federal levels enacted in 1992. Six states and the District of Columbia adopted standards based on ASAP’s model legislation over the past few years.
This year, legislatures and agencies in a dozen states (California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island) are considering standards. Several have begun to develop innovative new standards for “grid-flexible” appliances that can adjust their power demand throughout the day to correspond to the availability of inexpensive, low-carbon electricity.
A key climate strategy
Improved efficiency standards—both federal and state—are crucial for reaching the president’s goals of a carbon-pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and a net-zero carbon emissions economy by 2050. Our November 2020 report showed that improved U.S. standards could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an amount equivalent to the emissions of 13 to 25 average-sized coal-fired power plants. Big electricity savings will also reduce summer peak electricity demand in 2035 by an amount equal to 7% of today’s peaks and in 2050 by nearly double that, freeing up power system capacity for electrifying transportation and space and water heating. That will unlock even larger emissions savings.
Strengthening water efficiency standards, too—such as for showerheads and faucets—can ease the burden on strained water supplies that have been further taxed by climate change, while also reducing energy use from water utilities and water heating.
If the new administration gets the job done, it could save the average American household $230 every year on utility bills by 2035. States can add to that total. But the clock is ticking, so acting quickly and decisively is crucial.

New Process for Setting Model Building Codes Raises Concerns;"Statement by Steven Nadel, executive director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE):
“We are concerned about the new process announced today by the International Code Council (ICC) for setting model building codes. These codes, when adopted by state and local governments, play a key role in reducing the energy use and emissions of our homes and buildings. The ICC, which develops and publishes model codes, threw out the elections process by which state and local government officials recently overcame powerful commercial interests to secure large energy savings. Its board says the new process will deliver maximum energy efficiency that is ‘safe, technologically feasible, and life cycle cost effective.’ Now it needs to deliver on that promise. Only strong pressure from state and local officials committed to sustainability has made ICC deliver robust efficiency gains in the past. We will be watching and will hold the ICC to its stated interest in a balanced, fair process committed to the energy efficiency that is necessary to address the climate crisis.”
The International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), which ensures that new homes and commercial buildings in most states won’t needlessly waste energy, has been developed by an ICC committee on which (according to an agreement only recently made public) the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), an organization representing part of the regulated industry, played a dominant role. But code officials and other state and local government representatives were able to use their voting power in a subsequent review to routinely stop amendments that would have weakened efficiency requirements. For two 3-year cycles, the code barely changed. In the most recent cycle, code officials mustered a required 2/3 vote to approve significantly greater energy savings.
Now, despite major concerns, the ICC Board has changed to a standard-setting process in which there is no final vote by government officials, and in which the committee needs a 2/3 vote for all significant decisions, including any progress on efficiency. But the Board for the first time announced a broader framework to “help communities address their energy efficiency and climate mitigation goals.” As part of this process:
The code will have a new “intent” for maximum energy efficiency and increased energy savings each cycle.
The NAHB will not have reserved seats on the new committee (though home builders could have a significant role). Government representatives will make up 1/3 of the committee. The ICC is to choose committee members who are experts and have demonstrated commitment to the above intent.
Lifecycle cost effectiveness is a key criterion, with analysis to be provided by Department of Energy national labs.
The ICC will provide tools for governments seeking to meet climate and sustainability goals, such as the new zero-energy homes and zero-energy buildings appendices to the code.
A new Energy and Carbon Advisory Council is to identify goals, provide input on committee membership, and otherwise assist.
Steven Nadel said: “While these statements are notable, the ICC must follow through and go further. Key decisions that will affect the impact of today’s announcement remain ahead. In setting goals and cost-effectiveness parameters, the ICC should include a goal of zero-energy codes by 2030 and cost-effectiveness metrics that incorporate the time value of energy and the cost of carbon emissions.”
Nadel continued: “And most important will be the appointments to the development committees. The standards-setting process is designed to work out technical issues, not make political decisions. Committees that are ‘balanced’ between those opposed to change and those seeking climate solutions would collapse, unable to cross the 2/3 hurdle. The ICC will need to appoint diverse committees that are united in their commitment to large savings and oversee the new committees to make sure they keep on track. Only if the ICC Board breaks its deference to the NAHB and truly abides by its new energy efficiency and sustainability commitment can it meet our great need for reducing energy bills, making homes more resilient in the face of increasingly extreme weather, and combatting climate change.”

Carbon Pricing Expands in Canada, Making Slower Progress in the United States;"As talk of a carbon tax resurfaces with the start of the Biden administration, some form of carbon pricing applies to an increasing share of the population in the United States and Canada, according to a report jointly released today by the nonprofit research groups ACEEE and Efficiency Canada.
Read the Report
Carbon pricing, a climate tool to cut greenhouse gas emissions that is particularly popular among economists, now applies to a combined total of 37% of people living in these two countries—up from 31% two years ago. It’s considerably more common in Canada, where it’s required by federal law in all provinces and territories and thus covers all residents. In the United States, where it’s met formidable opposition but is gaining some ground, it currently covers 30% of residents.
In Canada, as the report notes, carbon pricing takes a few forms. Eleven provinces and territories have carbon taxes in place (though it was imposed by the federal government in four of them), and two have cap-and-trade schemes. There is also a separate, output-based pricing system in place in most jurisdictions for large industrial emitters. Under Canadian federal law, the carbon price must be at least $40 CAD per metric ton in 2021 and rise to $50 CAD in 2022 (approximately $31 and $40 USD at current exchange rates). The Canadian government has proposed increasing this price by $15 per year, until it reaches $170 CAD (approximately $134 USD) in 2030.
In the United States, there are three long-running carbon pricing programs: the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI, a cap-and-trade program now covering 11 northeastern and mid-Atlantic states), the California cap-and-trade program, and a carbon tax in Boulder, Colorado. In addition, Pennsylvania is considering joining RGGI and three northeastern states recently announced plans to adopt cap-and-trade on transportation fuels with several other states considering membership. At the federal level, carbon pricing legislation previously failed to pass Congress, but a carbon tax has the support of several high-ranking Biden officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who says President Biden supports it as well.
Carbon pricing’s impact and energy efficiency’s role
The British Columbia carbon tax has been in place for more than a decade, and multiple evaluations have found that it is reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions without hurting the province’s economy. Likewise, RGGI has been operational for more than 10 years, and evaluators have found that it has reduced energy use and emissions, reduced customer bills and wholesale power prices, created jobs, and boosted local economies. Evaluations of other carbon tax and cap-and-trade programs have been more limited, but they show results consistent with the British Columbia and RGGI findings.
Energy efficiency plays an important role in several of these states and provinces, in particular because of carbon-price-funded programs that help reduce energy use and cushion the effect of a carbon price on energy costs. RGGI, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Boulder devote more than half of their carbon-price revenues to funding energy efficiency programs, helping to achieve net economic benefits by reducing energy use, energy bills, and energy-related emissions. Substantial funds are also spent on energy efficiency in California, and in the Canadian province of Alberta, carbon-price revenue funded Energy Efficiency Alberta until its closing in September 2020 after a change in the provincial government. The Canadian federal government’s carbon-pricing system also includes efficiency programs targeted to small and medium-size businesses and institutional buildings.
While an important strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a price on carbon will need to be complemented by other approaches to reducing energy use and emissions, such as offering energy efficiency programs. As shown by international efforts and supported by the experience of California, current carbon-pricing programs alone have only a moderate impact on energy use and emissions, far less than the 80-100% reduction by 2050 that many countries, states, provinces, and cities are targeting.
Based on the findings of our new report, State and Provincial Efforts to Put a Price on Greenhouse Gas Emissions, with Implications for Energy Efficiency, we recommend that other states and provinces study carbon-pricing options and adopt a price that builds on lessons from these leaders. One key lesson is that a substantial portion of income from carbon-pricing programs should be invested in energy efficiency. Such investments drive considerable energy savings and emission reductions, helping to cut emissions beyond what a carbon price alone could achieve.
In addition, these energy savings reduce the cost of carbon for households and businesses. In particular, efficiency investments should target underserved sectors, including disadvantaged communities. This is an issue in both countries (e.g., unlike the United States, Canada does not have a national low-income weatherization program). Without such reinvestment in energy efficiency, the benefits of a carbon price, while still positive, are not as extensive. And without investment in disadvantaged communities, the residents of those communities could pay more than they benefit.

Electric Vehicles Top GreenerCars’ 2021 Ratings as Automakers Push Electrification;"All-electric and plug-in hybrids once again score highest on GreenerCars’ annual ratings, with models from eight automakers sweeping 10 of the top 12 spots and offering consumers eco-friendly options. The Hyundai Ioniq Electric retakes the top spot, which it held in 2018 and 2019, on the 24th GreenerCars ratings, released today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
Among the greenest cars, the Mini Cooper SE Hardtop Electric took second place, followed by the Toyota Prius Prime plug-in hybrid. Rounding out the top five are the BMW i3s and the Nissan Leaf. Tesla, which has seen its market value skyrocket, is the only U.S.-based automaker with a vehicle—the all-electric Model 3—on the ratings’ Greenest List.
Last year brought considerable turmoil to the U.S. economy and the automotive market as new vehicles sales dropped significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While 2020 was the first year pick-up trucks outsold sedans, continuing a trend toward larger, generally less-efficient vehicles, it also saw automakers expanding their lineup of electric vehicles (EVs) and promising more such models in the coming years.
“Today’s results provide a glimpse into a promising future with more efficient and greener vehicle options, driven primarily by electric models,” says Peter Huether, senior research analyst for transportation at ACEEE. “Consumers will benefit from the increasing number and variety of electric models, some of which offer affordable alternatives to gasoline cars.”
The 2021 Greenest List features the most environmentally friendly cars now available. Each car receives a Green Score based on an environmental damage index (EDX), which reflects the cost to human health from air pollution associated with vehicle manufacturing and disposal, the production and distribution of fuel or electricity, and vehicle tailpipes. ACEEE evaluated more than 1,000 models, including vehicles fueled entirely by gasoline or diesel, plug-in hybrids that run on both batteries and gasoline, and all-electrics vehicles powered solely by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells.

10. Toyota Rav4 Prime AWD Plug-In Hybrid 0.76 64
11. Toyota Corolla Hybrid Gasoline Hybrid 0.76 64
12. Honda Insight Gasoline Hybrid 0.77 63
No pure internal combustion engine vehicles made the Greenest List, although the Toyota Corolla Hybrid and Honda Insight (also a hybrid) gave a number of EVs a run for their money. This is a good indication that even a small degree of electrification can greatly improve fuel economy.
The resurgence of EVs on the Greenest List results from an update to the scoring methodology for estimating the emissions from charging them. This year, ACEEE rated EVs using electric grid assumptions that more accurately represent where plug-in vehicles are actually sold. California dominates the EV market and has a grid with an above-average share of power generated from renewable energy. This update reduces the estimated emissions from charging electric vehicles and bumps up their Green Scores. For potential EV buyers, the Electric Vehicle Emissions Calculator shows the impact in each state.
Not in the market for an EV? GreenerCars.org offers a Greener Choices list, identifying practical options in each vehicle class for widely available automatic transmission gasoline-powered models. This list includes conventional vehicles and traditional hybrids that are available in all 50 U.S. states, but excludes plug-in hybrids and pure battery EVs given the limited availability of charging stations.

While there are a few familiar faces on this year’s Greener Choices list, most models are new entrants. The 2021 list includes twice as many hybrids as the 2020 version, evidence of their superior performance and their presence in multiple vehicle size categories.
GreenerCars.org also provides a Meanest List, as usual made up of gasoline-powered large SUVs, pickup trucks, and European luxury cars that are the least friendly to the environment. The new RAM 1500 TRX 4x4 takes the first (”meanest”) position, with the rest of the list mostly populated by regulars from prior years.

Texas Blackouts Offer a Lesson for Reducing Dangerous Spikes in Energy Demand;"The historic winter storm across the central United States brought a fierce chill into the homes of millions of Texans who lost electric power. Extended outages played a role in many of the fatalities as some residents faced hypothermia and had to try to warm themselves through makeshift means.
Observers have focused on the factors that caused so much power generation to unexpectedly shut down, including frozen natural gas pipelines and coal piles, natural gas shortages, and, to a lesser extent, iced-over wind turbines. The power generators’ reliability must doubtless be improved.
But another key factor driving the blackouts was a sharp increase in power demand, driven by greater heating needs in the nearly unprecedented cold. In Texas, that demand blew past the grid operator’s previous winter record, and effectively required 15-20 power plants more energy than had been projected.
To help avert the next massive power outage from extreme winter weather, can policymakers help mitigate demand spikes?
Almost certainly. That’s because most homes today consume far more energy than necessary to meet their heating needs. For instance, almost 20% of homes in the South-Central United States are poorly insulated, according to federal data. That means heaters need to work harder to keep homes warm. In addition, many homes rely on out-of-date, inefficient heating technologies. And these challenges are generally worse for low-income, Black, and Hispanic households, who on average spend a far larger share of their income on energy costs.
Fix these problems, and you reduce demand surges that overwhelm the grid.
One of the most effective tools is home weatherization, which can involve relatively simple actions to better seal the home from the outdoors, add attic insulation, and fix leaky ducts. This alone can reduce heating demand by 11–14% and also cut air conditioning costs during the summer months.
Better-sealed homes not only reduce energy consumption. They also help residents who have lost power stay warm longer. For example, after an ice storm in Maine, power outages and subzero temperatures forced hundreds of residents into heated shelters. Yet others in particularly well-sealed homes saw their indoor temperature stay as high as 58 degrees after more than four days, allowing them to safely shelter in place. And well-weatherized homes are similarly important in summer storms, when power outages can leave people without air conditioning for days.
Heating energy demand in Texas and surrounding states could also be reduced in more than 40% of homes by replacing inefficient electric resistance heating systems with modern heat pumps. They use remarkably little energy, saving money for customers in the winter as well as in the summer, when they provide efficient air conditioning. And newer, cold-climate models have the capacity to operate efficiently even when outdoor temperatures are well below freezing.
Moreover, many modern heat pumps, water heaters, and connected thermostats can respond to price incentives or pre-set automatic signals to reduce or delay energy use. When many homes and businesses have equipment that can respond to those signals, they can contribute voluntary energy reductions when there is not enough power available, as opposed to the blunt instrument of forced outages.
It is fair to wonder whether these measures would hold up during the extreme conditions of a multi-day polar vortex event. We’ve recently conducted quantitative analysis and found that a combination of weatherization, heat pumps, smart thermostats, and sensors and controls that manage a building’s energy use can indeed significantly reduce energy use spikes over days. In some regions of the country during exceptionally cold periods, coupling heat pump systems with legacy natural gas backup can add an extra layer of resilience and further reduce strain on the electric grid.
Policymakers can encourage these solutions. State and local officials, for instance, can set building codes that require new houses and buildings to be highly insulated and well-sealed. Utilities can offer customers incentives for the purchase of more energy-efficient and connected heating equipment, and their state regulators can require them to do so.
In Washington, Congress can encourage home and building owners to invest in efficiency upgrades by providing rebates and tax incentives, while helping states and utilities expand weatherization programs that serve low-income households. And the Department of Energy should set stronger standards to ensure all new heating and cooling equipment is efficient.
Although this wave of extreme cold was nearly unprecedented, the polar vortex event that caused it will likely occur again as the climate grows more extreme. Investing now in reducing energy demand for heating and adding flexibility to the system will improve electric grid reliability, help keep people safe, and save electricity customers money throughout the year.

More Companies Are Setting Science-Based Targets to Cut Emissions: Now What?;"To address climate change, an increasing number of companies—more than 1,100 so far—have recently set science-based targets (SBTs) for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. Given the exigency of the climate crisis, companies need to not only set robust goals but also achieve them. While a lot of information is available on how to set SBTs, there is surprisingly little on how to achieve them. As part of ACEEE’s Industrial Decarbonization Initiative, this post examines how companies can pursue these goals while delivering for their business, value chain partners, and the planet. 
 
First though, some brief background on SBTs. They are clearly defined targets for companies to reduce GHG emissions and prevent the worst impacts of climate change. SBTs align with Paris Climate Agreement commitments to limit the rise of global temperatures to less than 2ºC above pre-industrial levels and to push for more stringent limits on this warming to 1.5ºC. They can also increase a company’s long-term value, because they help build business resilience, boost investor confidence, drive innovation, manage credibility and reputation, and prepare for changes in public policy.    
 
Manufacturing companies across sectors are setting SBTs, many as part of their sustainability goals, in response to customer, investor, and employee demands. For example, in cement, LaFarge Holcim has set SBTs and is pursuing them with a combination of recycling, fuel switching, and supply chain partnerships. Taiwan Cement is pursuing SBTs via renewable energy, waste recovery, energy efficiency, alternative materials, and biofuels. Here are examples of other companies taking action on the road to SBTs, by sector:
Steel: Cleveland Cliffs is using energy management, cleaner fuels, and innovative process technology to exceed GHG reduction targets.
Chemicals: Twenty-five companies have set carbon reduction targets, including nine that have set goals to be net-zero energy by 2050. For example, DuPont has committed to GHG reductions of 30% by 2030 using more electricity from renewables, energy efficiency, and low-carbon processes. And Eastman Chemical recently set ambitious reduction goals aiming to decrease carbon emissions 80% by 2050, including developing a strategy to address indirect emissions throughout the supply chain.
Food processing: PepsiCo has committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 75% and scope 3 GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 through energy efficiency, reduced supply chain emissions, and material efficiency. General Mills has committed to reducing absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions 30% by 2030 through reduced food waste, lower-impact packaging, and energy efficiency. (Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from plants, scope 2 are emissions from upstream power generation, and scope 3 are emissions throughout the supply chain.)
Oil and gas: Halliburton and Schlumberger Limited have announced that they plan to set SBTs this year. 
Paper: Timberlink has committed to a 53% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 via renewable electricity.   
Glass: O-I Glass, Inc. has committed to reduce absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions 25% by 2030. 
How to achieve these targets:
As with any goals, SBTs need to be SMART (specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, timely). Yet, because they call for big step-change reductions in GHG emissions, they’re outside the recent experience of many organizations. Companies may have made excellent progress in recent decades improving energy efficiency, reducing waste, and cutting emissions, but substantially greater reductions are needed, because analysis shows that projected GHG emissions remain well above the 2ºC scenario, let alone the 1.5ºC scenario.   
  
To put a marker on the magnitude of reductions needed, consider that even with the COVID-19-induced drop in GHG emissions, the level of reduction needed by 2050 to reach the 2 °C scenario is 10 times greater than the GHG emissions drop from the pandemic-led recession.  So, we have a lot of work to do. The good news: It’s possible to reach these goals without slowing down the economy, but it won’t be easy, and EVERYONE will need to contribute. 
 
With industry accounting for more than 25% of GHG emissions in the United States, it will play a crucial role in slashing emissions, while also meeting increasing societal demands for innovative, lower-carbon products. Recent reports, including those by ACEEE and CERES, describe pathways for industrial decarbonization such as beneficial electrification. To help teams at manufacturing companies start and proactively pursue their SBTs, here are 10 action paths to consider.
Top 10 Action Paths to Achieve SBTs: 
1. Assign senior management responsibility for making progress, tie compensation to performance, and set up regular updates.
2. Develop a strategy or roadmap and an action plan. Align it with business objectives, customer needs, technologies, etc. best suited to your company's industry. Break the goal into manageable subgoals (near, mid-, and longer-term). 
3. Develop a portfolio of projects that includes a healthy dose of energy efficiency projects. Efficiency is often the most cost-effective, ready-to implement, multiple-benefit pathway that could get society halfway to CO2 reduction goals by 2050. Look for opportunities to recycle and reduce waste. 
4. Look for synergies and business value and develop an expansive perspective to justify project economics (e.g., energy and non-energy benefits, customer value) to drive toward the goals. 
5. Build a network of internal proponents. Build a culture where the network relentlessly seeks and pursues energy and GHG reduction opportunities. Initiate an energy management program (e.g., strategic energy management (SEM), ISO 50001, ISO 50001 Ready) that strives for continuous improvement, as explained in a previous blog post on SEM. One example is Eastman’s Worldwide Energy Management Team, where external partners contribute to Eastman’s 1/3 reduction of absolute GHG emissions by 2030 through aggressive energy management.
6. Connect with peers, experts, and innovators to leverage learnings. DOE’s Better Plants program and the Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs) are two key resources.
7. Map the value chain, identify the opportunities for the greatest GHG reduction potential, work with partners to pursue those reductions, and pursue value/synergies. This is particularly important as SBTs drive for impacts and targets along the supply chain.
8. Identify emerging and transformative process technology and new low-carbon approaches that fit your customer and industry needs. Switch energy sources to lower-carbon alternatives, including renewable energy and biofuels/biomass and investigate options for low-carbon processes in your company.  
9. Collaborate on pilots/demos to advance technology, economics, implementation, and performance and implement the best options.   
10. Evaluate the carbon intensity of the top company products and strive to continuously reduce the product carbon intensity. Gain experience differentiating the lower-carbon products with customers.  
Setting SBTs is a growing trend in the corporate world with a strong connection to sustainability goals, investor interests, ability to future-proof growth, and reduce risks. Although the steep GHG reductions required for SBTs are challenging, there are numerous benefits and multiple paths for pursuing these goals. The top 10 action steps above are proactive paths for pursuing these goals with a durable approach for near- AND longer-term progress.

Small but Mighty: How Three Small Cities are Saving Energy and Embracing Renewables;"Leading small U.S. cities—like San Luis Obispo in California, St. Louis Park in Minnesota, and Rockville in Maryland—are showing how fellow municipalities across the country can take significant steps to cut energy waste and embrace clean energy.
These three ranked among the top scorers in ACEEE's recent analysis of efforts by 30 small U.S. cities to advance energy efficiency, renewable energy, and equity in planning and program delivery. As part of the Sustainable States Community Energy Challenge and with support from the New York Community Trust, we found that while all participating cities are taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, some are exceeding the efforts of even many of their larger peers.
To see how small cities can lead on climate, let’s take a closer look at how three of the top performers in this group earned their high scores and cut emissions.
San Luis Obispo, California, secured the highest score across all cities, thanks in part to its strong policies to reduce energy use in buildings. The city recently adopted a program to encourage all-electric new construction; it requires that builders either go all-electric or adopt a series of stringent efficiency measures (local amendments to the 2019 California Energy Code) and pre-wire buildings to be ready for future electrification of gas equipment. The city supports building owners and developers with technical guidance to meet the requirements and financial incentives.
San Luis Obispo’s participation in the Monterey Bay Community Power program, meanwhile, provides carbon-free electricity to residents. And the city supports the creation and implementation of energy efficiency workforce development programs through a partnership with neighboring counties. Officials hope that these efforts will substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector and ultimately achieve the city’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2035.
St. Louis Park, Minnesota, earned high scores for integrating clean energy strategies into its local government operations and across the community. The city has adopted energy reduction, renewable electricity, and climate change mitigation goals for the entire community. The city’s Climate Action Plan set an ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, with a midterm goal of reducing overall carbon emissions by 55% by 2030.
St. Louis Park has also adopted multiple policies to help meet its goal of reducing energy use in commercial buildings 30% by 2030. A recently adopted benchmarking and transparency ordinance requires commercial, multifamily, and public buildings larger than 25,000 square feet to report their energy and water use annually, to help identify—and spur—needed efficiency upgrades. St. Louis Park is one of more than 30 cities that have adopted building energy benchmarking policies. The city’s Green Building Policy also sets energy-efficient construction requirements, including building to LEED specification, and guides code compliance strategies for municipal, commercial, and multifamily buildings.
Rockville, Maryland, received high scores for its efforts to increase clean energy use in local government operations as well as its efforts to encourage the decarbonization of the electric system. Rockville requires commercial and multifamily building construction projects larger than 7,500 square feet to achieve LEED or similar green building certification. The city participates in Pepco’s Energy Efficient Communities program, which provides local governments with funding, technical assistance, and education to develop a municipal facilities energy efficiency plan.
Rockville has encouraged the decarbonization of the electric grid; it has submitted comments to state utility regulators urging them to advance the deployment of renewable energy. The city has also supported bills in Maryland’s legislature to strengthen the state’s renewable portfolio standard, allow community aggregate renewable energy purchases, and support community solar development.
Next steps for communities
Communities of all sizes can use ACEEE’s newly updated Local Clean Energy Self-Scoring Tool to benchmark their progress across five policy areas, identify areas for improvement, and compare themselves to cities included in the 2020 City Clean Energy Scorecard. Small cities can look to match—and beat—the efforts of these leaders and make a big dent in their carbon footprint when they do so.

Strategic Energy Management Programs Expand, Serving New Customers;"Commercial and industrial facilities are increasingly embracing strategic energy management (SEM) to reduce their energy use, thanks in part to new programs from several utilities. SEM is the systematic, continual improvement approach to energy management. Originally conceived as a way to integrate energy efficiency into industrial facilities, SEM practices are expanding, building on lessons from early successes and now helping businesses and municipal governments save more energy than ever before.
Programs quickly expanding  
Utility-sponsored programs supporting companies’ SEM efforts have been critical, and at least four more have begun since we published  a  January 2019  report on SEM programs across North America. Last year, the District of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) started two SEM cohorts: one for federal buildings and another for colleges and universities. These groups of similar customers participate in workshops and receive technical assistance conducting energy assessments and developing energy use models. These efforts will help building owners meet the city’s new building energy performance standards.  
 
In 2019, Vectren South introduced its SEM program to large energy users in southern Indiana. The utility assigned energy managers to participating customers, working with them over an 18-months period  to provide personalized energy management training and services.  Also  in 2019, National Grid built on its past experience with SEM by launching SEM Demonstration for industrial and manufacturing customers and beginning a three-year commitment to improve business energy management.  Similarly, Puget Sound Energy rolled out an evolution of its Resource Conservation Manager Program for industrial customers. The I-SEM offering, piloted in 2018 and becoming an ongoing program in 2019, offers customers collaborative learning opportunities, energy assessments, and support in developing energy models.  
 
Notably, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas, and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric collectively rolled out SEM programs for their customers in 2018.  In an evolution to the Continuous Energy Improvement program, the utilities joined together to issue the  California Industrial SEM Design Guide, which outlines customer objectives and goals to establish an energy management system.    
 
Today, more than 30 utilities offer SEM programs that serve a mix of industrial and commercial customers from sectors that include manufacturing, healthcare, and education as well as various municipal facilities. We expect continued growth as more companies, cities, and states set science-based targets for emission reductions (targets working towards greenhouse gas emissions reductions of 80% or more); the energy savings achieved through SEM can deliver a significant portion of these reductions, typically with relatively low capital expense. There are about 200 large utilities in the United States and Canada, presenting an opportunity for significant SEM growth.   
 
Since utilities and other program administrators started incorporating elements of SEM into industrial energy efficiency offerings more than a decade ago, we’ve had plenty of opportunity to see their success. Focus on Energy’s SEM pilot resulted in net annual electric savings of more than 21,000 MWh and nearly 4 million therms from 2015 to 2018, equilavent to roughly 4.5% and 10% respectively of the total savings from its Large Energy Users Program during this time period. It was also credited with a 1.8 MW reduction in power. Focus on Energy now has two SEM offerings, one for industrial facilities and another for healthcare facilities.
‘Fishing’ for energy savings
In SEM programs, utility customers are taught to “fish” for energy savings with a combination of coaching, technical assistance and, in many cases, incentives for improving their energy performance. The  energy  management practices are intended to result in  persistent energy savings. When the discussion shifts from what to do—rather than whether to do something—many customers engage in other utility energy efficiency offerings. Participants reduce energy waste, cut costs, and improve productivity.   
 
Strategic energy management provides a significant opportunity for energy savings. A  2015 ACEEE analysis estimated that SEM could be applied to 20% of commercial load and 50% of industrial load in the UnitedStates. In the absence of utility-run SEM programs, companies should leverage other resources that help improve energy management practices, including state and federal programs such as the Department of Energy (DOE) Better Buildings, Better Plants initiative.   
 
Companies face a dual need to reduce emissions and remain competitive. As calls for corporate climate action  increase and more companies set science-based targets for emission reductions, SEM can play a role. Since the development of the International Standards Organization energy management standard  (ISO 50001) in 2011, companies have been able to formally adopt SEM practices on their own. However, U.S. facilities have not achieved the same level of certification as those in other major economies such as Germany where a combination of incentives and mandatory certifications were used to drive adoption.The 50001 Ready program administered by DOE is a self-attestation program designed with ISO 50001 energy management elements that lower barriers to full ISO implementation.
Municipal governments, too, can use SEM to reduce energy use and emissions across their buildings and operations. Not only can SEM help them meet their internal climate goals, direct support for SEM can complement state and local policies such as energy efficiency resource standards and building energy performance codes. For example, North Carolina sponsors an 50001 Ready industry cohort, which started in 2020. A  recent ACEEE analysis shows that expanding SEM practices could save nearly 1% of the 2040 forecasted electricity sales in North Carolina.   
 
National and regional organizations have helped accelerate this growth through collaborative efforts to improve program design, evaluation, and performance. We expect to see SEM programs continue to grow in number and impact as they are offered by more utilities, and as companies, cities, and states work to cut costs, energy use, and emissions.  
 
The North American SEM Collaborative, a project for ACEEE, supports the SEM community of practice by engaging stakeholders and providing thought leadership. The NASEMC will soon offer a professional membership for organizations and individuals that want to be on the leading edge of this expanding community. For more information on membership and the benefits of SEM, please contact Andrew Whitlock at awhitlock@aceee.org.

Report: As Electric Vehicle Costs Drop, States’ Efforts to Ease Barriers Vary Dramatically;"First-of-its-kind analysis of 50 states and DC identifies leaders and laggards
Washington, DC—With transportation now the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, several states are taking comprehensive steps to help enable residents and businesses to use and charge electric vehicles, yet many others have done little to reduce barriers, according to a first-of-its-kind report released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Read the Report
Most of today’s electric vehicles (EVs) cause significantly fewer emissions overall than their gas-powered counterparts, and many have lower lifetime ownership costs, thanks to low fueling and maintenance expenses. But the higher initial purchase cost and lack of access to vehicle charging remain barriers for many households and fleet owners—obstacles some states are mitigating by offering incentives to buy EVs, adding more charging options, and setting lower electric rates at preferred charging times.
 View the Report Webinar
The State Transportation Electrification Scorecard finds that California is far and away the national leader in enabling the use of EVs. It is the only state to set deadlines for electrifying transit buses, heavy trucks, and commercial vehicles. The state is also one of few to offer assistance for lower-income drivers replacing older, high-polluting cars with zero- or near-zero-emissions vehicles, and it plans to deploy chargers in economically distressed and environmental justice communities.
California earned 91 of 100 possible points, followed by New York (63.5 points), Washington, DC (59), Maryland (56), Massachusetts (54.5), Washington (54), Vermont (54), Colorado (48), Oregon (47), and New Jersey (44). In contrast, 20 states earned 15 points or fewer.
While many states have taken promising steps to electrify transportation, all have considerable room to improve their policies. Ultimately, a full shift to affordable and accessible electrified vehicles—powered entirely by zero-carbon energy—will be necessary to bring emissions to zero and support livable communities.
“Transitioning to electric vehicles is vital for the climate and for reducing costs for households and businesses,” said Bryan Howard, state policy director at ACEEE and lead report author. “The leading states are embracing this transition, but many more are just starting, even as the automakers are preparing a burst of new electric models.”
Shruti Vaidyanathan, transportation program director at ACEEE and a fellow report author said, “State policymakers can make a concerted effort to enable an electric vehicle transition that not only reduces pollution, but also helps improve access to electrified transportation and quality of life for everyone. The transition won’t happen soon enough nor equitably without the right policies in place.”
The most common state actions to electrify transportation include planning for more EVs and EV charging options (23 states); incentives such as rebates, tax credits, and grants to buy large electric pickups and delivery trucks (27 states); using federal funds to buy electric transit buses (48 states); utility programs that offer lower electric rates at preferred times for EV (Level 2) charging (36 states); and utility funding to spur EV and EV charging adoption in low-income areas and environmental justice communities (15 states). These actions provide key examples of opportunities for other states that have not yet taken these steps.
The scorecard identifies commendable efforts in each region of the country, including the following:
New York was the second-highest ranking state and the top scorer in the Northeast. It has a strong set of incentives for individuals and fleet owners to purchase EVs, and the state and utilities incentivize installing charging infrastructure. The states’ utilities have also targeted more than one-quarter of the investment in their EV infrastructure program toward lower-socioeconomic and disadvantaged communities.
Washington, DC, ranked third. It is a leader in setting ambitious goals for the deployment of personal EVs, together with strong investment in electric transit buses, producing significant development of charging options.
Colorado earned the highest score in the Southwest; it has adopted a goal of having 940,000 EVs on its roadways by 2030. Lawmakers adopted incentives for EV charging investments and required utilities to file plans for EV charging infrastructure. Regulators recently approved a utility plan to install approximately 20,000 chargers throughout the state.
Minnesota was the top scorer in the Midwest (39.5 points). Regulators issued guidelines on utilities’ investment in charging stations, bringing $23.6 million in funding, with more proposed. The state has signaled its intent to adopt California’s zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) program for personal vehicles.
Virginia performed best in the Southeast (36 points), with solid incentives for electric trucks and buses, time-varying electric rates for home and workplace chargers, and steps to decarbonize the electric grid.
“I’m thrilled that California is being recognized with top honors for our leadership efforts, especially at a time when Governor Newsom is doubling down on our commitment to ensuring all Californians can participate in the transition to clean transportation,” said California Energy Commissioner Patty Monahan. “Our experience shows transportation electrification is a win-win: good for the economy and most importantly for the health and well-being of those affected most by air pollution from tailpipe emissions.” 
ACEEE identified three policies that are likely to have the greatest impact for spurring adoption of EVs: ZEV mandates and electric vehicle deployment targets, financial incentives for vehicle purchases, and incentives for installing vehicle chargers. The report scored the states on 40 policies in total, identifying where legislatures, executive agencies, and utility regulators in each state can make progress.
The report evaluates the states in six areas, finding the following:
Overall, states did best in planning and setting goals for EV deployment and charging infrastructure, though all still had room for improvement. Twelve states have adopted California’s ZEV program for personal vehicles, requiring manufacturers to offer a certain number of electric or other zero-emission vehicles each year.
Many states offer tax credits and rebates to encourage EV purchases and development of charging stations, together with non-financial incentives such as HOV lane access. Some states have registration fees for electric vehicles, and in some instances these fees exceed what the driver of an average gasoline car would pay in gas taxes—providing a disincentive for electric vehicles. States earned points for utility-sponsored incentives for installing charging equipment and infrastructure.
Most states have significant room for growth in improving the efficiency of the entire transportation system, such as by setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, implementing greenhouse gas pricing policies, and investing in electric public transit buses.
Many states have made substantial progress in integrating EVs into the electricity system, earning points for setting time-varying rates that offer power for vehicle charging at lower prices during off-peak times, such as at night. States are also reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from their electrical grid which also reduces the impacts of EVs.
Low-income, economically distressed, and environmental justice communities are more likely than others to experience harmful health impacts from gas and diesel vehicles. Yet if states and utilities do not make a deliberate effort to include these groups in EV incentives and infrastructure development plans, they could reinforce existing racial and economic inequities. Few states earned many points for their efforts in this category.
Finally, states were scored on their outcomes to date—the number of electric vehicles and charging facilities (across several categories), number of electric transit buses, and reduction in greenhouse emissions from transportation overall. Leaders in the other sections generally scored well here, and states can expect their scores on these metrics to improve in the future after they implement recommended policies.
For states not in the top 30, the report recommends a series of foundational steps, including comprehensive planning efforts with specific goals, benchmarking progress, collecting data, incorporating spending carve-outs or funding adders for low-income, economically distressed, and environmental justice communities in state and utility EV planning, leveraging existing sources of funding such as the Volkswagen settlement fund, and establishing clear direction to encourage utility and third-party investment in charging stations.
For states that are represented in the top 30 but are in earlier stages of policy development, the report calls for offering on-the-hood incentives for purchase of EVs, codifying targets for vehicle and charger deployment, allowing utilities to make charging infrastructure investments, establishing clean energy targets for the electric industry, and setting overall greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals for the transportation sector.
The scorecard was based on information collected from centralized databases/information sources, additional internet research, and feedback from subject matter experts and state contacts during an external review process.
Later this month, ACEEE will publish its annual GreenerCars report, which ranks the greenest vehicles now available to consumers, many of which are fully battery-powered vehicles.

Biden Wants Zero-Emissions Buildings. No Tiny Windows Needed.;"Zero-net-energy (ZNE) buildings—ultra-efficient buildings that produce as much energy as they use with on-site renewables like solar panels—earned a surprising moment in the spotlight last year. Then-candidate Joe Biden called for “legislation to set a new net-zero emissions standard for all new commercial buildings by 2030,” prompting then-President Trump to respond that it “means no windows” and later say it meant “tiny windows.”
This is no joking matter, because buildings account for 40% of U.S. energy use and about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Moving toward ZNE buildings is vital. So are windows, of course.
If you’re wondering what these buildings could look like, they’re already here—and their numbers (both commercial and residential) are increasing.
We’re excited about these buildings’ impact—or lack thereof—on the climate. But we know a building’s effectiveness is also measured in the shared experience of those working, learning, and living in it. Fortunately, one of the keys to a ZNE building—for both for user experience and energy use reduction—is optimizing natural light.
More daylight means less energy used on lighting. Double- or triple-paned windows and reflective glass can help maintain a comfortable indoor temperature by trapping or reflecting heat. Natural light also has a positive effect on how people experience buildings, with study after study praising its benefits for health, wellness, and resident satisfaction.
But don’t just take our word for it: from office spaces to schools to libraries, here are commercial examples from across the country that prove that ZNE buildings can literally make the future brighter—for both the people working in them and the planet.  New Buildings Institute and Team Zero have lists of residential projects, and Zero Energy Project has case studies showing that these apartments and single-family homes are also bright and airy.

When its office building needed a renovation, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) decided to aim for a zero-net-energy building. It executed the first ZNE commercial office renovation in Washington, D.C. AGU said it wanted to demonstrate that “a building located on a tight urban footprint can operate on a zero-net-energy basis, reduce its carbon footprint, and serve as a productive and healthy place to work and meet.”
Planners looked to recycle as much of the previous building as possible, reclaim energy and water with a green wall, and install a solar PV array. One key strategy for AGU’s design was to enhance the use of natural daylight wherever possible and install windows that help keep the building cool by reflecting heat.

“Incorporating natural daylighting into the built environment is vital, but it also requires a fine balancing act,” Ryan Poole, the leader of DPR Construction’s Global Sustainability Group, told ACEEE. “It’s important to focus on how sunlight will hit the building, how the space is laid out on the interior, how efficient you can make the building.”
At 34,000 square feet, DPR’s San Diego and Phoenix locations are the first zero-net-energy offices of their size in their respective cities. The offices save energy, and the company reports an improved satisfaction rating of employees who work in ZNE offices. DPR is now retrofitting its Washington, D.C., office to join the ranks.

A key part of retrofitting California Lottery’s Santa Fe Springs office to be ZNE was adding natural light wherever possible. During the retrofit, the design team added skylights to enhance daylighting and illuminate workspaces. The building now includes 22 prismatic lens skylights and is lit primarily by natural light. Interior glass walls, known as relights, distribute this light throughout the workspace.
Currently, the California State Lottery is working with LPAS Architecture + Design on achieving ZNE at eight additional offices, by both retrofitting existing facilities and constructing new buildings.

ACEEE Launches Leading with Equity Initiative to Better Measure Progress on Energy Equity;"For nearly 15 years, ACEEE has released numerous scorecards and progress reports to benchmark and drive clean energy action among states, localities, and utilities. Through these efforts, we have captured best practices and set a high bar for identifying clean energy leaders. Moving forward, we want to ensure energy efficiency leadership clearly includes efforts to advance equity, and that everyone has equitable access to and benefits from clean energy investments. To that end, with support from the Barr Foundation, the Kresge Foundation, and The JPB Foundation, and in partnership with AEClinic and Kinetic Communities Consulting, ACEEE is today launching the Leading with Equity Initiative.
Too many Americans struggle every month to afford high energy bills—a problem that the COVID-19 pandemic and recession have exacerbated. Our 2016, 2018, and 2020 research on energy burdens—the percent of income spent on energy—shows that high burdens fall disproportionately on marginalized communities, particularly in areas that have been subjected to other systemic racial and environmental injustices. Within the energy industry itself, Black, Latino, Native American, and other historically marginalized groups represent a small fraction of workers and decision makers. This perpetuates the cycle of exclusion, underinvestment, and inequitable clean energy policies and program outcomes. 
In recent years, ACEEE has begun to tackle these issues head on by examining the many ways in which energy efficiency policy and programs can address these inequities and create the needed systemic change for a fairer and more just clean energy economy. This commitment is reflected in our Call to Action, released last year. We put efficiency at the forefront of our ambitious efforts to build a vibrant and equitable economy that reduces energy waste, saves money, creates jobs, and fairly distributes the benefits of clean energy investments to all. 
An Emerging Emphasis on Equity in ACEEE’s Scorecards 
Our research efforts and engagement with those at the forefront of designing and implementing clean energy strategies indicate increasing commitment to further equity-driven approaches. At the same time, our research has revealed there’s still much work to do. Take, for example, what we’re seeing in cities across the United States.  
In ACEEE’s 2020 City Clean Energy Scorecard—where we track clean energy actions of the 100 largest U.S. cities—we center equity throughout by evaluating the extent to which city-led actions are informed by, and held accountable to, input from communities. We consider whether actions are designed to benefit all residents, especially those groups disproportionally overburdened by energy costs and historically excluded from accessing and benefiting from clean energy investments. 
Specifically, we assess the extent to which cities and in some cases, the utilities that serve them do the following: 
Engage in equitable and inclusive climate and energy planning  
Adopt inclusive procurement and contracting policies for municipal operations 
Promote inclusivity in clean energy workforce development programs 
Support renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives for low-income households 
Foster clean, efficient transportation for low-income communities 
Overall, few cities scored well on these metrics. Among the few cities making real progress, most were focused on making sure communities were directly engaged in developing plans and creating accountability metrics to ensure they achieve their equity-related commitments. In comparison, fewer cities gave marginalized groups—such as those with low incomes, housing insecurity, and disabilities as well as people of color, the youth, the elderly, immigrants, and non-English speakers—formal roles to participate directly in and affect the outcome of decision-making.  
Our 2020 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard found that some states are trying to foster equitable policies. For example, California, New Jersey, and Oregon have taken steps to expand programs that better meet the needs of customers with lower incomes. Also, our 2020 Utility Energy Efficiency Scorecard found that utilities are dedicating more of their efficiency funding (on average 10% of total portfolio spending) to low-income programs than in previous scorecards. As a result, average low-income program energy savings (in MWhs) increased by more than 60% from 2015 to 2018. Overall, 31 of the largest 52 utilities in the United States offer comprehensive programs for low-income customers, such as home weatherization and retrofits. Still, states and utilities can do much more to ensure that policy and program outcomes are equitable. 
Next week, we will release our first-ever State Transportation Electrification Scorecard. While I cannot divulge the findings (no spoiler alert here!), I can say that all states will need to do a lot more to promote equitable access to electric vehicles and charging stations. Such clean vehicles will be a vital tool for reducing emissions and addressing climate change.  
Digging Deeper with Our New Initiative 
With our new two-year Leading with Equity Initiative, our research will dig deeper into equity challenges and solutions. With more-comprehensive metrics that measure equity-centered clean energy policy and program outcomes, communities can work to hold policymakers accountable and drive outcomes toward more equitable decarbonization for all.  
This project will convene community-based organizations, advocates, and utilities to jointly define what success looks like for equitable decarbonization. We will then work to further embed metrics that drive equitable clean energy outcomes into ACEEE’s Utility, State, and City Scorecards. Building on ACEEE’s utility peer working groups, we will also work with utilities and program administrators to outline how their portfolios can advance equitable outcomes broadly and determine what data is needed to measure the success of these offerings. We will collaborate to push the needle to develop new policy, encourage necessary data collection, and foster collaboration to achieve more equitable decarbonization.  
The Leading with Equity Initiative will have two concurrent, parallel advisory groups, one for community-based organizations and advocates, and one for utilities and program administrators.  
Through a series of workshops, we aim to: 
Ensure frontline communities are represented and are jointly driving the development of improved equity-related metrics 
Better understand current utility, state, and city capacity to report data on desired metrics  
Generate proposed changes to each of ACEEE’s scorecards, setting the bar in a way that represents real performance on the metrics that matter most to communities  
Join the Initiative

Survey Shows Broad Bipartisan Support for Stronger Energy-Saving Standards;"As President Biden and Congress consider proposals this year to tackle the climate crisis, a new survey shows broad bipartisan support for energy efficiency measures, notably stronger energy-saving standards for vehicles, appliances, and new homes and buildings. 
About 80% or more of U.S. registered voters support several Biden-backed policies, with support highest among liberal Democrats but with backing from at least 50% of conservative Republicans. These policies include tax incentives or rebates to homeowners, landlords, and businesses to make existing buildings more energy efficient (88% overall) or to buy electric appliances (80%), rebates to people who buy energy-efficient vehicles (82%) as well as stronger energy or fuel efficiency standards for new buildings (86%), appliances (83%), and cars, trucks, and SUVs (78%). 
“Most registered voters support policies to reduce energy use and improve efficiency,” said the post-election survey of 1,036 registered voters that was released earlier this month by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication. 
  President Biden, who unveiled an ambitious $2 trillion climate plan with several energy efficiency proposals during the campaign, has already taken steps to undo President Trump’s environmental legacy.
On his first day in office last week, Biden signed an executive order that directed federal agencies to review and consider suspending, revising or reversing many rules enacted over the past four years. Among them are Trump’s rollback of energy or fuel-saving standards for vehicles, buildings, and appliances such as those for washers and dryers and light bulbs.  
Today, in an additional executive order, the White House directed federal agencies to make climate action a central focus of their efforts, promote environmental justice in their work, push to develop a zero-emissions power sector by 2035, and buy zero-emission vehicles for their fleets. 
The survey, conducted between Dec. 3 and 16, shows Biden and Congress would have the public’s strong support to expand clean energy and address the climate challenge. In other results, a slight majority of U.S. registered voters (53%) said global warming should be a high or very high priority and two-thirds (66%) said developing clean energy sources should be a high or very high priority. Three out of four voters (75%) favor U.S. participation in the Paris Climate Agreement, which Biden said the United States would rejoin. 
Energy efficiency drew more across-the board political support than many other clean energy and climate policies queried. The survey shows backing for several energy efficiency policies that ACEEE has analyzed and supports because of their ability to create jobs, save money, reduce pollution, protect health, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. President Biden can implement some of them and additional ones on his own,  but others will require approval and funding from Congress. 
Biden’s second climate plan, released last summer, called for energy-efficient retrofits of four million commercial buildings and weatherization of two million homes over four years. It proposed building performance standards, strict building codes as well as cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade and electrify home appliances and install more efficient windows. It also proposed ambitious fuel economy standards and consumer rebates to swap old, less energy-efficient vehicles for newer, more efficient ones. Biden said he would promote electric vehicles and invest in 500,000 EV charging stations. 
Biden is expected to send an infrastructure package to Congress this spring that will include energy efficiency and other clean energy measures.

COVID-19 Fuels Real Estate Scramble To Repurpose And Retrofit Buildings;"Even before the COVID-19 era, commercial real estate had been wrestling with the existential questions of the future of office buildings. Businesses, from tech companies to financial firms, were rethinking the role of office space. More companies were developing telework policies, embracing shared office spaces, and downsizing headquarters. The pandemic has intensified some of these developments, proving to once-skeptical business managers that most—if not all—office work can be done virtually. It has also heightened the need for flexible office space, repurposed office space, more-efficient homes that accommodate telework, and healthier buildings.
Nora Wang Esram will be speaking about how COVID-19 is shaping the long-term outlook for indoor air quality, productivity, and efficiency on a webcast hosted by 75F at 2:00 p.m. ET today
Data reflect some of these ongoing shifts. While total commercial building floor space continued to grow in the past decade, the growth did not occur in traditional office and retail sectors, but rather in service (40%), public assembly (39%), lodging (35%), and warehouse and storage (26%), according to the Energy Information Administration’s 2018 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey. This provides evidence that offices and brick-and-mortar stores are facing disruptive challenges. In contrast, demand for lab space for life sciences (pharmaceutical, biotech, and other medical research fields) has been growing in many cities, while offices sit empty, according to the CBRE Real Estate Market Outlook.
Repurposing offices to labs and apartments
Prior to the pandemic, lab space in the United States had increased 170% in the past 10 years. The race for coronavirus therapies and vaccines has certainly further ramped up investment in lab space. In many areas, building owners have been converting offices to life-science facilities and to apartments, or turning empty stores to e-commerce fulfillment centers.
The upcoming wave of adaptive reuse presents huge building retrofit opportunities beyond normal tenant buildouts. Energy efficiency programs and policies should capture these opportunities to incentivize and support landlords and businesses to integrate building efficiency technologies and measures that are beyond the minimum code requirements for major renovations. These programs should not only aim to reduce building energy use, but also help building owners achieve greater flexibility to better adapt to unforeseen future changes.
The rise of flexible office space
The pandemic has also accelerated the demand for more flexibility in office space. In the short term, some offices have been redesigned for the new reality of social distancing. In the long term, more agile office spaces are needed to support the transformation of the office from a place where people spend their day working to a place where staff visit occasionally to collaborate, meet with clients, or retreat.
The uncertainty and fluctuation in occupant density make it more challenging to operate buildings if they are not equipped with energy management technologies and strategies. A few studies, for example by the University of California at Davis, Carbon Lighthouse, and hatchdata, have shown that empty office buildings during the COVID lockdown still consume a significant amount of energy (up to 100% of pre-lockdown use). In a more competitive real estate market where fewer tenants are willing to pay a hefty utility bill for a half-empty office, there will likely be more appetite for modular and more-efficient HVAC equipment, miscellaneous-load management, and building automation.
Teleworking’s impact on energy use
While energy sales in the commercial sector fell 11% during the first three months of the pandemic (April-June 2020), sales in the residential sector increased 8%, partly because of increased teleworking. A National Bureau of Economic Research study in April and May 2020 shows that half of the U.S. working population (employed pre-COVID19) worked from home. A growing share of the office labor force will gradually return to the office as more businesses and buildings are expected to resume in-person operation sometime this year. However, many workers may permanently remain working entirely or partially from home because of relaxed telework policies, enhanced infrastructure to support virtual communication, and the ultimate transformation of office space.
Increased telework will shift work-related energy costs and other expenses from employers to employees. Depending on commute means and distance, increased household energy bills may be offset by reduced commuting expenses for some employees. For those who had low commuting expenses (including costs covered by employee benefits supported with favorable tax policy), there will be a negative economic impact. Lawmakers and employers should develop policies to address this challenge. Employers could offer higher compensation, direct utility bill reimbursement, and alternatives to commuting benefits. But in the long term, they should look to reallocate funds previously spent on office facility costs (including rent and utilities) to finance employees’ home energy efficiency upgrades.
This presents great opportunities for residential energy retrofits. Homeowners will have more incentive to make their homes more efficient and more comfortable when they spend a great deal of time working there. Renters will choose more-efficient and comfortable apartments or houses over proximity to their work location. Energy efficiency programs and policies should leverage the desire for home repair and remodeling to stimulate residential building energy retrofits through education, incentives, workforce development, and financing.
Not only does teleworking increase household energy use, but it also changes the load pattern of the residential sector. A study of energy consumption in Texas shows that the energy load profile from April through July of 2020 was nearly identical across days of the weeks—every day is like Sunday! Demand management strategies for the residential sector must be calibrated to adapt to this new reality. Although challenging, the changing energy use pattern in homes could allow more households to participate in providing grid service (e.g., energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation and storage) when equipped with in-home load coordination and management technologies. This will provide more opportunities for utilities and providers of smart home technologies and energy management systems to harness the power of homes for energy savings and load flexibility.
Moving toward heathier buildings
The COVID pandemic has raised public awareness of indoor air quality (IAQ) and generated a wave of research, products, and services for public health. For the first time, many tenants are asking about ventilation rates and demanding safety measures. As landlords and building managers seek solutions to reduce viral spread in buildings, vendors are introducing all kinds of services and products, from HEPA filters to germicidal lights that have been primarily used in hospitals or clean rooms (note that for some of these products, there is little evidence to support their effectiveness in reducing viral transmission). Although dilution, filtration, and source control are proven IAQ management methods, over-ventilation, super high filtration, and excess outdoor air intake without proper strategies will increase energy demand, overload equipment, and potentially cause more harm to occupants.
There is little conflict between improving IAQ and reducing energy use if done correctly. The public interest in and tenants’ demand for healthy indoor environment can create opportunities for building retro-commissioning, automation, and retrofit. HVAC systems should provide ASHRAE Standard 62.1 and similar code-compliant ventilation rates. Governments and utilities can develop incentives and technical assistance programs that combine public health with energy efficiency. Such cross-cutting programs need federal and local champions to drive collaborations among health departments, municipal buildings departments, and state energy and resources agencies. These programs could help building and business owners upgrade with high-efficiency equipment, variable speed drives, demand control ventilation, dedicated outdoor air systems, and advanced controls and automation to improve comfort and occupant health, while saving energy and reducing carbon emissions.
Schools, senior care centers, and other buildings used for public assembly—especially those for vulnerable populations or with aging facilities—need special attention. The recent $900 billion federal relief package provides $54 billion for the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) fund. Congress authorized ESSER funds to be used to repair and improve school facilities to reduce the risk of virus transmission and exposure to environmental health hazards. As a recent ACEEE blog post notes, “The need to improve HVAC systems in response to COVID-19 comes at a time when school facilities are already grappling with an enormous backlog of projects to address deferred maintenance and overdue capital improvements.” Local education agencies, which will receive at least 90% of the ESSER funding, can use help from the Department of Energy and other energy organizations to develop school upgrade plans for longer-term benefits in the wake of COVID-19.

This Is The Year For Florida To Get Utilities’ Energy-saving Programs Back On Track;"Utility-led energy savings programs are essential for bringing the benefits of energy efficiency to homes and businesses, but in Florida, many are being left out. The efficiency programs there are saving a fraction of the national average, because of state rules and practices that discourage practical, high-impact investments. At a time when many Floridians are struggling to pay their bills, saving energy is essential.
A 1980 law requires the state’s seven largest electric utilities to set annual energy saving goals, but for the past several years, some have proposed goals of zero savings. This recently prompted the Florida Public Service Commission to initiate a rulemaking—which has its first workshop this week and will continue over the coming months—to amend the process for setting energy savings goals. It’s a crucial opportunity to reform utility energy efficiency policy in the Sunshine State, helping utility customers in this difficult time with programs that reduce energy bills and can lead to a better quality of life.
View ACEEE’s new white paper: Florida’s Unrealized Energy Efficiency Potential
Efficiency programs in Florida lag while many households struggle with bills
Florida’s utilities are out of standard practice in their energy efficiency program offerings, savings, and goals. ACEEE’s 2020 Utility Energy Efficiency Scorecard ranked the state’s three largest investor-owned electric utilities (Tampa Electric Company (TECO), Duke Energy Florida, and Florida Power & Light (FPL)) at 46th, 48th, and 51st out of the 52 largest utilities nationwide in terms of program performance and savings. The state’s other major utilities are similarly underperforming.
This is depriving Floridians, particularly low-income households and small businesses, of energy efficiency measures that could reduce their bills. Without targeted utility-led programs, many residents in multifamily buildings and businesses that are struggling during a recession won’t have the time, the budget, or the knowledge to access and implement energy efficiency measures on their own.
Meanwhile, many Floridians face energy bills that strain their budgets. ACEEE recently found that in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale and Tampa-St. Petersburg metropolitan areas, low-income households spend, on average, about 7% of their incomes on utility bills. And about 12% of households in these metropolitan areas are “severely burdened,” spending more than 10% of their incomes on energy costs. Black and Hispanic households are particularly likely to face high burdens.
Stronger energy efficiency programs could cut bills and create jobs
A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that the average single-family home in Florida can reduce its energy use by up to 23% through efficiency upgrades, such as improved HVAC, water heating, and lighting—an example of what utility programs can do. Most of these upgrades pay for themselves with bill savings in five years or less and can last for a decade or longer. Utility-run programs can raise customer awareness about energy saving options, reduce upfront costs of upgrades, and help customers install these technologies in homes and businesses.
In addition to providing energy savings on customers’ bills, energy efficiency is the largest source of jobs in Florida’s energy sector. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 120,000 Floridians worked in the sector, performing vital work such as HVAC installation and efficient building contracting. There are more than 15,000 Florida businesses in the energy efficiency sector, and the vast majority are small businesses with fewer than 100 employees. This industry has suffered greatly during the COVID-19 recession, losing more than 18,000 jobs in 2020. Investment by utilities could create much-needed local jobs.
Energy efficiency measures also deliver system-wide benefits that reduce costs and improve reliability for everyone, even those who do not get an upgraded appliance or new insulation. Reducing the overall need for energy can delay or avoid entirely the need to construct new power plants. The overall cost of saving energy is consistently as cheap or even cheaper than most types of electricity generation, particularly fossil fuels. Investing in energy efficiency as a clean energy resource—replacing more expensive and polluting methods of generating power—can reduce electric rates for all utility customers.
The solution: Change Florida’s approach to valuing efficiency
Florida regulators have an opportunity in the new rulemaking to revamp the state’s lagging efficiency programs by reforming weak policies that are holding back progress.
First, they can eliminate the state’s reliance on an outdated cost-effectiveness test, the Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM) test. This test overestimates costs and undervalues benefits from energy efficiency. It counts energy savings as lost revenues for the utility and considers them in addition to program costs. Under this approach, the more energy a program saves, the less cost-effective it is. Florida is the only state that still uses RIM as its primary test; every other state has moved on, recognizing that it does not accurately represent the value of energy efficiency as a resource.
Another barrier the regulators can address is the use of a two-year payback screen for efficiency measures. This blocks utilities from implementing some of the lowest-cost, highest-impact programs. For instance, LED light bulbs, which have consistently delivered energy savings in other states, are missing entirely from Florida utilities’ program offerings. This screen could simply be eliminated.
Finally, the commission can target energy savings to customers who are most in need. Although state law requires its utilities to offer some income-qualified programs, it does not include a specific spending or savings target for these groups. Establishing such requirements, either in dollars spent or energy saved, helps guide utilities’ investments and ensures they are reaching the right communities.
Implementing common-sense, outcome-based goals for customers in need and broadening utilities’ overall portfolio of offerings will help bring Florida back in step with current practices and policies for utility energy efficiency and reduce costs for households and businesses. This year is the chance for Florida to get it done.
For a detailed look at the challenges for utility energy efficiency programs in Florida and recommended solutions, see ACEEE’s new report, Florida’s Unrealized Energy Efficiency Potential.

Trump’s DOE Saddles Households with High-Cost, High-Emission Furnaces and Water Heaters;"Biden Will Need to Undo Rule Before Setting Strong Standards
Washington, DC—In its waning days, the Trump administration’s Department of Energy (DOE) today announced a final rule that will keep energy-wasting furnaces, water heaters, and boilers on sale for years to come—if it is not undone. The rule would block the Biden administration from significantly strengthening efficiency standards for products that are responsible for the largest share of energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions in many homes.
Efficiency standards for home gas furnaces have been stuck since 1987, and home water heater standards since 2010 (DOE has missed legal deadlines for considering updating both). An ACEEE/ASAP report published in November found that these two products are the biggest opportunities for the Biden administration’s DOE to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through efficiency standards. Strengthening standards for the equipment affected by today’s rule could, by 2035, save households $3 billion annually on their gas utility bills and cut climate change emissions by an amount equal to the total emissions of more than two million typical U.S. homes today, according to the report.
The new rule could stymie those efforts by effectively blocking DOE from significantly strengthening standards for gas water heaters, furnaces, and boilers. It requires separate “product classes” for equipment that fails to capture and use some of the heat that goes up the flue, in effect legally separating these less-efficient models from their modern counterparts, allowing their continued sale. The Biden administration would need to first undo today’s rule before being able to set strong standards covering all water heaters, furnaces, and boilers.
DOE’s action today also included withdrawing standards proposed in 2016 for residential furnaces and commercial water heaters. The Biden administration would now need to start anew on these standards, using a longer rulemaking process set by DOE in January 2020.
“This keeps inefficient furnaces and water heaters on the market, which saddles homeowners and renters with needlessly high energy costs for decades ahead,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “Furnaces and water heaters that unnecessarily waste gas are a climate nightmare, and we need to stop installing them.”
Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), said: “This rule is a blatant, anti-consumer attempt to block the Biden administration from finally moving us away from these inefficient products. Undoing this rule and then setting strong standards for furnaces and water heaters is no small task, but that’s what the Biden administration is going to need to do, and quickly.”
Today’s rule was requested in a 2018 rulemaking petition to DOE from the American Gas Association, American Public Gas Association, National Propane Gas Association, Natural Gas Supply Association, and Spire, Inc.

State Leaders Can Save Rural Residents Money With Energy Efficiency;"On average, rural residents spend 40% more than their metropolitan counterparts on their energy bills, relative to income. Energy efficiency can help lessen these costs, often by making customers’ homes more energy efficient. Because rural residents can be more difficult and expensive to reach than their urban counterparts, utilities and statewide efficiency program administrators can easily overlook them. New research from ACEEE demonstrates that several states across different climates and political environments are using effective policy tools to drive rural energy and utility bill savings.

  Chester, Vermont: Efficiency Vermont helped Lynn and Buddy Behrendt add insulation to their attic and knee walls, spray foam their basement walls, and air-seal throughout their home.
Use Geographic Equity as a Metric of Success
State regulators can set performance metrics and incentivize program implementers to deliver efficiency programs directly to rural customers. Utility performance incentives are already a common policy tool for overall efficiency performance, and most of the largest U.S. electric utilities are in states with policies that establish such incentives.
Some public utility commissions (PUCs) offer utility performance incentives for meeting energy efficiency program goals; they can go a step further by incorporating a geographic equity metric. PUCs in Vermont and Oregon have used these metrics for their statewide efficiency program administrators, Efficiency Vermont and Energy Trust of Oregon.
Cave Junction, Oregon: Energy Trust of Oregon helped Kelpie Wilson and George Shook design and build a home with a high-performance heat pump and windows, heat recovery ventilation system, and rooftop solar.
Design Energy Efficiency Targets to Help Munis and Co-Ops Succeed
Energy efficiency resource standards (EERS) encourage near- and long-term savings from utilities. On average, states with an EERS policy achieve efficiency savings and spending levels that are more than three times higher than states without an EERS. State regulators and policymakers should establish energy savings targets for munis and co-ops, while allowing flexibility in how they meet those targets.
Michigan and Minnesota, for example, include munis and co-ops in their energy savings targets and allow them to either operate their own efficiency programs or work collaboratively with umbrella organizations to administer programs and report on progress. This flexibility can help minimize the administrative burden on smaller utilities trying to comply with efficiency targets, while still requiring them to report regularly on their progress.
Untapped Opportunity for Rural Energy Efficiency
State leaders are increasingly recognizing the importance of serving their rural constituents, who stand to benefit from the comfortable homes, lower bills, and other advantages of energy efficiency. Some states are leveraging this potential, but countless untapped opportunities remain. By implementing the energy efficiency policies highlighted in ACEEE’s new report, state leaders will help advance an equitable clean energy economy.

ACEEE Analysis Finds Small Cities Can Lead on Clean Energy, Too;"Washington, DC—An analysis of clean energy efforts by 30 small cities finds several leaders taking significant steps to cut energy waste and embrace clean energy—pointing the way for other small municipalities across the country to do the same. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) examined the cities’ efforts to make homes and buildings more energy efficient, to scale up the use of renewable energy, and to ensure community involvement in developing equitable clean-energy policies. The cities analyzed, with populations generally between 16,000 and 100,000, are in California, Connecticut, Maryland, Minnesota, and New Jersey.
San Luis Obispo (California) received the top score of the group, earning points for its policy incentivizing all-electric equipment and appliances in new buildings and for participating in a program that offers carbon-free electricity to residents. Second place went to Goleta (California), followed by St. Louis Park (Minnesota), Manhattan Beach (California), West Hollywood (California), West Hartford (Connecticut), Rockville (Maryland), Dublin (California) and Red Wing (Minnesota) (tied), and Rochester (Minnesota).
ACEEE evaluated each of the communities on policy metrics assessing government operations, community initiatives, buildings policies, and energy and water utilities. The combined scores allowed ACEEE to rank the municipalities. The analysis assessed policies and programs to make energy efficiency upgrades in homes and businesses, accelerate the adoption of renewable energy, set long-term commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and establish and enforce building codes.
ACEEE scored the cities’ energy efficiency and renewable energy strategies using the metrics from its annual City Clean Energy Scorecard, employing a modified version of its Local Clean Energy Self-Scoring Tool, Version 4.0 released in 2019. The leading small cities outperformed a significant portion of the larger cities scored each year (excepting transportation policies, which were not evaluated for the small cities).
The 30 cities volunteered to be evaluated as part of the Community Energy Challenge sponsored by ACEEE, the Sustainable States Network, Sustainable CT, Green Cities California, Sustainable Maryland, Minnesota GreenStep Cities, and Sustainable Jersey. Moving forward, ACEEE and the Great Plains Institute will provide the cities with technical assistance to support their energy efficiency and renewable energy efforts.
While each participating city is taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the highest scorers led the way by setting goals to reduce energy use and greenhouse emissions, adopting green building requirements, and pressing for decarbonization of the electric grid. Even these leaders have significant room to grow, earning roughly half of the available scoring points.
“We found that even quite small cities and towns can take meaningful action to cut energy waste and reduce carbon emissions,” said David Ribeiro, director of local policy at ACEEE. “A number of critical tools to fight climate change—and to do so in an equitable way—are things that have to be set locally. From the largest cities to the smallest ones, they’re all going to need to step up further. We hope some of these leading cities can help show the way for their peers.”
The cities’ scores are as follows:

Halt To Progress Of Utility Efficiency Programs Could Rob New Hampshire Of Economic Boost;"In the midst of the COVID-19 recession, when the economic benefits of energy efficiency would be especially helpful, New Hampshire is on the brink of halting progress. The state’s noteworthy advancement in utility energy efficiency efforts in recent years is suddenly in jeopardy.
Since establishing its first Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS) in 2017, New Hampshire has improved its standing to 18th in ACEEE’s annual State Scorecard rankings (and 13th in the “utilities” category). This has been welcome progress in catching up to its very successful New England neighbors and has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for New Hampshire ratepayers.
However, in a rather concerning development late last month, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (PUC) balked at approving a proposed new triennial 2021-2023 energy efficiency plan. The decision was surprising because it came after months of collaborative discussion produced a consensus settlement agreement proposal, signed by all the state’s utilities (Eversource, Liberty, Unitil, and the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative), the state residential ratepayer advocate, and a coalition of nonprofit organizations. Their proposed plan would have taken effect on January 1 and would have included utility commitments for saving 4.5 percent of electric sales and 2.8 percent of natural gas sales over the plan’s three years through their efficiency programs for customers. The economic benefits to ratepayers and the state economy would be enormous.
Instead of simply approving the multi-party settlement proposal, the PUC said it would take eight more weeks to consider the case and temporarily extended the existing utility plans, which deliver fewer benefits to customers. This was, disturbingly, the same result that a group of legislative opponents of energy efficiency programs had requested. They had not questioned the existence of such savings potential, but rather, claimed that their objection was to increasing energy efficiency charges in light of pandemic-related economic disruptions.
Testimony in this case on behalf of New Hampshire’s Office of the Consumer Advocate took on that economic argument directly. Witness Philip Mosenthal of the consulting firm Optimal Energy stated, “To the contrary, I believe that the economic harm from the Covid-19 pandemic makes it more important than ever to pursue robust energy efficiency.” Mosenthal projected that the proposed EERS plan would trigger 17,500 job-years, more than $1 billion in additional labor income, and almost $3.5 billion in increased economic output in New Hampshire. “While this type of economic benefit would be compelling at any time… it is particularly so during the Covid-19 pandemic, when many sources of local economic spending are either drying up (restaurants, tourism) or shifting to online and less local sources (retail).”
ACEEE has previously made very similar arguments, noting that energy efficiency programs can help states and localities with economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis in three important ways: (1) reducing household and business energy bills, directly helping with affordability challenges; (2) serving as an economic stimulus by generating increased local employment (energy efficiency programs tend to be very labor intensive); and (3) reducing ”dollar drain” from the local economy by reducing the need for imported energy fuels (New Hampshire has to import from other states and countries essentially all of the energy fuels it consumes).
It is noteworthy that several other states (e.g., Missouri, Pennsylvania) faced challenges to their utility energy efficiency efforts in the past year and overcame them. Regulators in those states considered arguments to delay or weaken efficiency programs and ultimately rejected them. Similarly, Arizona recently emerged from a period of stalemate and uncertainty to recognize the continued importance of energy efficiency and set more ambitious goals into the future, serving as a good model for other states.
We hope New Hampshire will ultimately proceed with the strong energy efficiency progress foreseen in the filed consensus settlement for its 2021-2023 plan. The PUC can approve that plan in eight weeks, just in time to help revitalize the New Hampshire economy. The eyes of the nation, and New Hampshire’s neighbors in the region, are on the Granite State.

"2020 Was A Wild Ride; Opportunities Await In 2021";"The past year was a difficult one in energy efficiency as in so many parts of life, dominated by COVID-19 and the Trump administration, but quite a few states and localities quietly made progress amid the tumult. Many challenges of the pandemic will remain in 2021, but the Biden administration and state and local actions will provide opportunities for landmark progress in several areas of efficiency policy.  I expect this progress to align with ACEEE’s Call to Action, launched last year as part of our 40th anniversary and aimed at using energy efficiency to slash U.S. energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
COVID
Efficiency workers are often unable to enter homes and other buildings because of COVID. As a result, U.S. efficiency-related employment declined by about 500,000 jobs by May 2020, before partially recovering to a net loss of 320,000 jobs by the end of October, aided by a variety of strategies employed by efficiency programs and contractors. With many people now working from home, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, residential energy use has increased about 3% over the March-September period compared to the previous year, but commercial and industrial sector energy use have each declined about 8%. The transportation sector has been most influenced by COVID, with energy use during this period nearly 20% less than the same period in 2019. Because of the COVID-induced recession, the International Energy Agency estimates that 2020 efficiency investments will be about 9% lower than in 2019.
For 2021, we hope efficiency jobs will gradually recover, but they would be aided by investments in job-creating economic stimulus programs, as discussed in the next section.
Trump exits noisily, Biden seeks to change course quickly
In its final 18 months, the Trump administration aggressively pushed its deregulation agenda. It scaled back federal fuel economy standards, withdrew authority for California and other states to set their own vehicle standards, essentially freezing most appliance standards, rolled back a few standards, and changed the rules on how standards and environmental regulations are set, creating new hurdles for the Biden administration to clear. Most of these actions are being challenged in court (e.g., see here). The courts may allow the new administration to voluntarily vacate some Trump rules; others will have to be reversed via new notice-and-comment rulemakings. 
President-elect Biden has pledged to pursue an aggressive climate agenda as one of his key priorities, and there is much the Biden administration can do administratively on climate and energy efficiency. Biden has said he will quickly rejoin the Paris climate agreement. Prior to the scheduled meeting of the Paris agreement parties in November, the new administration will need to develop 2030 greenhouse gas reduction goals and a plan for achieving these goals.
The new administration will likely quickly restore California’s ability to set its own vehicle standards (which also apply in many other states) and set more-aggressive fuel economy and emissions standards for cars and other light-duty vehicles. It will probably implement the statutory light bulb standard that raises the bar for most screw-base light bulbs to LED and CFL efficiency levels. It will start updating appliance efficiency standards for the more than two dozen product categories for which DOE has missed legal deadlines, plus a similar number for which legal deadlines are approaching.
DOE and EPA will likely emphasize decarbonization in research and regulatory decisions and will probably increase support and technical assistance to states and localities on energy efficiency and other ways to cut greenhouse gases. While they may act more slowly, Housing and Urban Development, Defense, the General Services Administration (which runs many federal buildings) and other agencies should act to make homes and buildings they influence much more efficient, and regulatory agencies are likely to require publicly-traded companies to report on climate risks. And a Biden EPA will likely tighten air quality standards, perhaps starting with the ambient air quality standards for fine particles (including from vehicles and power plants) that the Trump administration recently left unchanged.
What Congress does in the new year is a big question. Who controls the Senate agenda will be determined by tomorrow’s election in Georgia. But with Senate filibuster rules requiring 60 votes, bipartisan support will be needed to enact most major legislation (even if Democrats win control, several Democratic senators have indicated they do not want to eliminate the filibuster). Actions that might be in play include an economic recovery package (Biden has pledged to “build back better”), an infrastructure package, a transportation bill (the current authorization of federal transportation programs expires at the end of September), and the 2022 budget. The one exception to needing 60 votes is for budget bills, where there are procedures to enact legislation with 50 votes, providing a narrow path to enacting some of these items.
Energy efficiency programs and policies can be included in all of these. For example, a September 2020 ACEEE white paper on potential investments for an economic recovery package found that about 660,000 jobs could be supported by a package of 17 specific energy efficiency programs. In addition, members will continue to develop new legislation, such as revisions to energy efficiency tax incentives (end-of-2020 legislation extended most of them for one year without changes), additional energy legislation (building on the modest bill passed in December), and longer-term climate legislation (a clean energy standard, carbon tax, and increased research and development have received some bipartisan support).
States and localities
While the federal government was doing little to address climate and energy efficiency in 2020, states and cities were quietly making progress on these issues, despite shortened legislative schedules and tightened budgets due to COVID. ACEEE’s 2020 City Clean Energy Scorecard identified more than 160 efficiency and clean energy actions by 100 large cities in the year since the last Scorecard. Particularly notable was adoption of mandatory building performance standards by St. Louis, building on similar actions in Washington, DC, and New York City in 2019. Equity concerns received heightened attention at the city level, with cities increasing engagement with, and clean energy investments in, low-income communities and communities of color.
At the state level, a variety of efficiency actions advanced in 2020. Virginia’s legislature adopted energy-saving targets for utilities, and New Jersey adopted rules to implement targets previously set by its legislature. Arizona and New Hampshire have taken steps to increase their energy-saving targets. Many states adopted measures to increase sales of electric vehicles, particularly California, which adopted requirements that specified percentages of truck sales be zero-emission vehicles (electric or fuel cell), and where the governor issued an executive order to require that by 2035 all light-duty vehicles sold be zero emissions. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia pledged to ensure that 100 percent of all new medium-and heavy-duty vehicle sales be zero-emission vehicles by 2050, with an interim target of 30 percent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2030. All of these actions are discussed in ACEEE’s recently-released 2020 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard.
For 2021, states and cities are likely to continue to act, recognizing that a Congress that struggled to agree on actions to address the COVID emergency is unlikely to take dramatic action to address the climate emergency. I expect more states to adopt increased clean energy goals, expand equity-focused programs, adopt new appliance efficiency standards, and take steps to advance electric vehicles and other clean transportation options. For example, three Northeast states and Washington, DC, will soon start implementing the Transportation Climate initiative announced just before Christmas, with another eight states considering joining. Likewise, many cities are poised to take action, including several now considering building performance standards (e.g., San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Cambridge, Mass.) and many planning to expand equity-focused programs.
Conclusion
At the beginning of 2020, ACEEE launched a Call to Action as part of our 40th anniversary activities. It outlines bold steps for using energy efficiency to halve U.S. energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, making a large contribution to U.S. decarbonization efforts. In 2020 we made some progress, particularly at the state and local levels; we look forward to picking up the pace substantially in 2021, continuing state and local progress, but also working with the new administration and Congress on federal initiatives.

Year-End Bill Includes Some Energy Efficiency Provisions but Leaves Much to be Done;"Washington, DC—A massive year-end bill, announced by congressional leaders today, includes provisions to improve the weatherization of low-income homes and reduce industrial emissions, while missing the opportunity to include a critical measure that could save $40 billion in energy costs by making new buildings more efficient.
This omnibus bill, which funds the federal government for the remainder of the fiscal year and provides $900 billion in COVID-19 relief funding, also contains a bipartisan package of energy legislation, including several efficiency measures. The bill would:
Modernize the federal Weatherization Assistance Program to help it address health and safety issues in homes, add solar cells, and test innovative approaches to expanding weatherization. These provisions are based on legislation sponsored by Reps. Bobby Rush (D-IL) and Paul Tonko (D-NY) and Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Susan Collins (R-ME).
Reduce industrial energy use and greenhouse gas emissions through research and development of efficient industrial technologies, technical assistance, and the development of a national smart manufacturing plan.
Authorize a smart buildings program, energy and water-saving pilot programs, an energy-saving information technology plan, coordination of assistance for retrofits in schools, rebates for efficient motors and transformers, and other programs.
Make technical corrections to better measure the energy efficiency of large ceiling fans in standards.
“We applaud these meaningful steps, but we urgently need efficiency efforts at an even greater scale to address the climate crisis and create the large numbers of jobs that will get us out of this recession,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
The bill also would require federal agencies to perform cost-effective efficiency measures identified in energy audits, using performance contracting for half of them.
The bill omits certain bipartisan provisions, including one that would help cities and states voluntarily implement stronger building codes. Those provisions were passed by the House and included in a proposed bipartisan amendment to the Senate energy bill. An ACEEE analysis published in February found that these provisions would save households and business almost $40 billion in energy costs (net after investment) over the lifetime of the measures through 2050, and would reduce carbon dioxide emissions (cumulatively) by an amount equivalent to the emissions from 300 coal-fired power plants in one year.
The bill’s COVID-19 relief section includes $14 billion in funding for struggling public transit agencies, whose success is key for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating healthy and livable communities, and ensuring equitable access to clean transportation. An earlier House-passed relief bill would have given $32 billion in transit funding.
The bill announced today generally maintains funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE), the home of several major federal energy efficiency initiatives. The Weatherization Assistance Program and Building Technologies Office receive slight increases.
The bill also makes permanent a tax deduction for commercial building owners to make energy efficiency upgrades. It indexes the incentive value to inflation and allows the IRS and Energy Department to update the baseline efficiency level to require greater efficiency (except for lighting).
In contrast, the bill again extends outdated tax incentives meant to spur home energy efficiency improvements and the construction of efficient new homes. Because these incentives have been extended year to year without updating the efficiency requirements even as technology has evolved, today their market impact appears to be limited. Members of Congress from both parties have proposed a plan—supported by manufacturers and efficiency advocates—to modernize the credits to ensure they can effectively drive energy efficiency improvements.
President-elect Biden and House Speaker Pelosi have been clear that they view this bill as only a stopgap, and believe larger investments in the economy are needed next year. An ACEEE analysis published in September found that Congress could help confront the economic and climate crises together using a series of 17 energy efficiency programs and tax incentives. The analysis found these efforts could add 660,000 job-years through 2023 while cutting $120 billion in energy bills and reducing carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to those released by nearly 200 million passenger vehicles in a year.

‘Buy Clean’ Policies Have Promise, But We First Need To Know Which Products Are Low-carbon;"Legislators and advocates are increasingly looking to spur demand for low-carbon products, which is a key step for reducing industrial emissions. In this approach, government purchasing power can help provide a market signal for products with lower embodied carbon (reflecting the impact of all greenhouse gases across extraction, manufacturing, and transportation to the purchaser). 
Federal and state efforts have enormous potential, but implementation has proved difficult because key information is often missing. In fact, inadequate data poses a broader challenge and is hampering many efforts to cut carbon.
Data on the carbon content of materials and systems for tracking and transparently reporting information across supply chains are inadequate. There is variation in current rules for reporting, exemptions, and standards and how product lifecycles are estimated. These challenges make harmonization of targets difficult. We must address these barriers if we are to identify, label, and prioritize low-carbon products.
California’s efforts demonstrate both the potential for demand-side solutions and the challenge of data limitations. The Buy Clean California Act (effective in 2019) requires contractors that bid on infrastructure projects to disclose greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for certain materials that they plan to use. These disclosures, called Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), allow government purchasers to take the embodied carbon of materials into account, in turn using the states’ purchasing power to influence manufacturers to reduce emissions.
When U.S. manufacturers quantify the carbon content of subparts, some data are just not available. Data from other regions that require reporting (e.g., Europe) could be considered, but the differences in energy systems and policies may introduce additional uncertainty. For example, the California Department of General Services was forced to add 20 percent to the baseline GHG compliance limit for eligible materials to account for uncertainty of data sources.
Other confounding factors include variation in how construction, use, and end-of-life stages of products are factored into the EPDs. It doesn’t help that factories are often updated faster than databases, leaving accessible public data behind current practice. New tools such as the Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3) aim to address some of these issues. 
Efforts to close the gap
Policymakers are starting to take notice of the data challenges. In Washington State, Oregon, and Minnesota, legislators planning Buy Clean policies aim to incorporate lessons from California while tailoring bills to fit their states’ specific manufacturing capacity. For example, a study for Washington State recommended the development of a North American lifecycle inventory database, formation of a searchable EPD database, and development of a common benchmark methodology to improve EPDs.
A proposal for a federal Buy Clean program in the Clean Future Act would mitigate some of the data gaps and standardization issues by creating a National EPD Database. The bill would direct EPA to assist manufacturers to help standardize EPDs and develop both strategic plans for certain vulnerable industries and clear rules for reporting.
Other data challenges
Data challenges arise in numerous areas beyond embodied carbon. Limited data are available for attributing carbon emissions for various parties in supply chains, understanding potential climate impacts and risks, and reallocating capital (e.g., after a corporate merger, acquisition, or divestiture). For example, when companies try to calculate GHG emissions for their products along the supply chain, they can encounter information gaps and different baselines. The share of leading companies reporting GHG emissions has stalled at 60%, which leaves large gaps in investor knowledge on carbon risks. At the federal level, a report by the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis recognized the challenge, noting that “new knowledge infrastructure” including “data gathering and analysis—will also be crucial in implementing technologies for reducing industrial emissions.”
What’s needed
Both industry and government will need to take steps to manage carbon information. Collaborative agency research (including by EPA, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology) is necessary to establish nationally recognized processes for measuring, publicly reporting, and labeling the carbon content of products or materials sold domestically. Congress should task an agency (e.g., the Advanced Manufacturing Office at DOE or the Climate Protection Partnerships Division at EPA) with developing and coordinating knowledge infrastructure for energy and carbon across multiple sectors. That lead agency should also be tasked with creating and updating standardized metrics to ensure that information is consistent, verifiable, and readily understood.
We suggest that clearinghouses be set up to assemble key data for embodied carbon, emissions, and energy inputs. Policy and technology roadmaps from DOE and other agencies presenting pathways to low-carbon manufacturing should be connected to the data clearinghouses, allowing industry to pursue decarbonization with reliable data and clearly defined rules for following carbon along supply chains.
These actions will provide important stepping stones toward presenting embodied-carbon information on product labels that consumers can use to make informed purchasing choices, like they have for more than a quarter century with ENERGY STAR® labels ranking energy efficiency. An embodied carbon label will result in greater demand for low-carbon products and a virtuous cycle stimulating low-carbon manufacturing and supply chain choices. But we must act quickly to build a solid knowledge foundation because this will take time to get in place, and the clock is running on our need to respond to climate change.

Granholm Will Bring Strong Energy Efficiency Record To DOE;"Jennifer Granholm, President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Department of Energy, has received wide media coverage for her accomplishments in renewable energy (e.g., Michigan’s first renewable portfolio standard) and her high-profile work with the auto industry and electric vehicles. However, she has also had notable successes in another critically important area: energy efficiency. 
As a two-term governor of Michigan, the first woman to hold that job, Granholm successfully pushed for the state’s first energy-saving targets for utilities, financing for energy efficiency building retrofits, and a climate action plan.
I worked on some of these efforts as a policy advisor to the director of Michigan's Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth (DELEG) during a nine-month sabbatical from ACEEE in 2008-2009, so I can give firsthand testimony.
Utility energy efficiency programs
Governor Granholm worked tirelessly with a divided legislature (House-Democratic, Senate-Republican controlled) to establish, with bipartisan support, the state’s first energy efficiency resource standard (EERS) in 2008. The legislation (PA 295) created energy efficiency program savings requirements for electric and gas utilities, and enacted various regulatory reforms to make the programs feasible. This was a sea change for Michigan, which had not had any utility energy efficiency programs for the previous 10 years.
The effort was so successful that by the end of Granholm’s time in office, Michigan was cited as the “most improved state”’ in our 2011 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. This policy effort has stood the test of time as one of the best examples in the nation. In total since the passage of PA 295, Michigan’s energy efficiency programs (termed “energy waste reduction”) have invested more than $2.5 billion in energy efficiency measures and services, and will result in utility system cost savings to customers of more than $8 billion.
Energy efficiency financing
In 2009 under Granholm, DELEG applied for and received one of the largest energy efficiency grants under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), to design and implement a series of community energy efficiency retrofit pilot programs. Out of that effort grew a statewide nonprofit energy efficiency lending institution called Michigan Saves, which has facilitated more than $270 million in low-interest loans for more than 28,000 residential and small commercial energy efficiency retrofits. Just this month, Michigan Saves was cited by the Energy News Network as a great example of energy efficiency support that could be a model for the incoming Biden administration.
Climate
Through executive order in 2007, Granholm created the Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC), a joint group of government, business, and other stakeholders, to develop a climate action plan for the state. It discussed and developed several energy efficiency and renewable energy goals and strategies. Planning objectives included statewide energy savings targets (ultimately achieved by the state’s first EERS described above) and the first renewable portfolio standard. Unfortunately, the MCAC was disbanded by the subsequent governor after Granholm left office in 2011.
Continued action on energy efficiency and climate
After her time in office, Granholm continued her commitment to energy efficiency and clean energy through the American Jobs Project a nonprofit, non-partisan effort she founded and at which she served as board chairperson. The group, which has since disbanded, focused on growing advanced energy economies in states using state-specific economic clusters around energy efficiency, renewables, and advanced manufacturing.
In summary, Jennifer Granholm is clearly a proven leader in clean energy, including energy efficiency. She knows how to work with government, business, labor, and other stakeholders to create American jobs—a critical skill for the incoming Biden administration intent on addressing climate change. We look forward to working with her.

Hurt By COVID-19, Transit Needs Public Confidence And Increased Funding;"This post is the third in a series focused on the energy efficiency implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first post explored how to reduce transmission risks in buildings without wasting energy, and the second one looked at how to create safe, sustainable schools. 
As the United States enters the most serious phase of the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, and many households continue to restrict their daily activities, personal vehicles are increasingly seen as the safest way to travel, to the detriment of more efficient modes of transportation. Public transit, in particular, has seen a significant reduction in ridership. Transportation data company Transit estimates that the demand for services across all major metropolitan areas in the country is currently 66% lower than normal. To ensure it remains a viable option, especially as the U.S bounces back from the pandemic, transit will need to regain public confidence, and its struggling systems will need guaranteed financial support.  
Research has shown very little evidence that public transit systems are the super-spreaders that many people think they are. While commuters are understandably skittish about riding on buses or trains, data from around the world does not show a direct correlation between public transit and COVID transmission. In Paris, none of the early COVID-19 clusters in April or May were traced back to public transportation. Likewise, cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong, which have robust public transit ridership and dense systems, have not seen any clusters originate from their public transportation facilities. In New York City, COVID-19 rates are entirely unrelated to trends in transit ridership.  
In any case, transit agencies can use a number of global best practices to lure commuters back to buses and trains, including the following:  
Enforcing face-covering rules 
Creating and implementing daily protocols for cleaning and sanitization 
Limiting capacity on buses and trains and using real-time data to help riders identify less-crowded times to use services 
Transit’s value 
Such measures will be vital, because public transit serves as the backbone of major urban centers and is the single cleanest and most efficient way to move people en masse. It produces 50% less carbon dioxide per passenger mile than an average private vehicle. But beyond the climate and energy impacts, public transit access creates healthy, livable, economically thriving communities. Transit connects households to critical job centers and, during the pandemic, has been indispensable to medical, frontline, and other essential workers. Equally important are the air pollution benefits that accrue as a result of moving passenger travel away from personal vehicles and reducing congestion, especially as underlying respiratory illnesses make people significantly more susceptible to COVID-19. Residents gain additional health benefits as they walk to and from stations and hubs.   
Even before the pandemic, transit agencies saw steep drops in fare-based revenues, as they have struggled in recent years to achieve steady and significant levels of ridership. COVID-19 could hamper the return of reliable public transportation if policies aren’t enacted to support these systems. As the pandemic continues, ensuring that urban residents have access to public transit will be crucial. In particular low-income communities and communities of color are likely to bear a disproportionate impact of unreliable access to public transportation options. African Americans, for example, account for 12% of the U.S. population but 24% of public transportation riders. Access to public transit and other shared mobility options reduce transportation expenses for low-income households and may obviate the need for vehicle ownership.  
Federal funding 
The best practices discussed above will help only if public transit facilities receive the financial support required to continue providing reliable essential service and maintaining facilities. The federal government’s first round of 2020 stimulus funding, passed in March, included $25 billion in emergency financial aid for transit agencies. In October, the HEROES act allocated an additional $32 billion, but it passed only the House, not the Senate. With the next round of stimulus funding still up in the air and emergency aid quickly running out, transit agencies are looking to more permanent funding at the federal, state, and local levels.  
Federally, part of the solution will involve creating sustained pots of funding for non-highway modes of transportation. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is the primary source of federal transportation dollars and is largely directed to road-based capital investments. While the HTF can also fund transit infrastructure improvements, typically only about 20% of the funds are allocated to transit. Additionally, the HTF has needed periodic infusions of general government revenues to cover severe shortfalls. The transportation reauthorization bill could help address this imbalance by identifying specific carve-outs from the HTF for public transit and also creating additional sources of funding. The Moving Forward Act proposal released by the House this past summer takes some initial steps to do the above, allocating an additional $105 billion for transit procurement, maintenance, and operation.  
Other financing options 
Innovative funding solutions have appeared at the state level in recent years. An increasing number of states are considering carbon pricing programs that will allocate collected revenues to sustainable transportation efforts including vehicle electrification, public transit operation, maintenance, and expansion, and bicycle/pedestrian infrastructure. California’s cap-and-trade program is the best example. The state deposits funds into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and distributed among state agencies to finance projects that have demonstrated GHG reduction impacts. More recently, the Transportation and Climate Initiative’s proposed regional cap-and-invest program offers an opportunity to shore up flagging transportation systems in participating states by placing a cap on transportation emissions and requiring gasoline and diesel wholesalers to purchase allowances for the carbon content of their fuels. Revenues must then be directed to efficient transportation solutions.  
As COVID-19 continues to take a bite out of fare revenues, local solutions like congestion pricing can supplement funding generated at the federal and state levels. Like carbon pricing efforts, collected funds could be directed to efficient transportation options. Congestion pricing programs, such as the one New York City is planning, also improve livability and localized air quality in urban areas and communities located near high-traffic corridors. In general, federal, state, and local solutions will need to ensure that funding as well as equitable pollution and transportation access outcomes go to the communities that need them most. COVID-19 impacts have ravaged low-income communities and communities of color, which have historically borne a higher health burden from transportation-related emissions. The current U.S. transportation system has been shown to further compound the inequalities between Black and white populations.  
As COVID-19 continues to devastate the U.S. population and economy, investing now in public transit will not only serve as a much-needed economic stimulus once the nation emerges from the pandemic, but will also lead to more efficient, accessible, and equitable transportation systems in the long run.

Scorecard: States Adopt New Energy-Saving Rules but COVID-19 Slows Overall Progress;"CA ranks #1 in U.S.: MA, MN, CO, and VA are regional winners; NV is most improved
Washington, DC—More U.S. states have adopted or advanced new energy-saving targets and vehicle and appliance rules, but COVID-19 slowed other efficiency efforts, according to the 2020 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard released Wednesday. For the first time in four years, California took first place nationwide, edging out Massachusetts, the leader in the Northeast. Other regional leaders include Minnesota in the Midwest, Colorado in the Southwest, and Virginia in the South.
The 50-state scorecard (which also includes Washington, DC) from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) found that states, many of which have set ambitious climate goals since 2018, had to abruptly shift their focus this year to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the deadly global pandemic. Across the country, energy efficiency workers lost jobs—with an estimated more than 300,000 still unemployed—pointing to the need for policymakers to help get them back to work.

While some efficiency efforts stalled, others advanced before or during the pandemic. In top-ranked California, for example, utility regulators in January approved $45 million in incentives for high-efficiency heat pump water heaters, a crucial technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In September, Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order calling for the phase-out of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035.
Rounding out this year’s top 10, are Massachusetts (#2), Vermont (#3), Rhode Island (#4), New York (#5), Maryland (#6), Connecticut (#7), Washington, DC (#8), and Minnesota and Oregon (tied for #9).
“A number of states see that they have to act aggressively now to cut carbon emissions, but others just aren’t acting urgently. We need to see more states follow the leaders here, and quickly. Aggressive state policies combatting climate change are absolutely necessary no matter what gets done in Washington,” said Steven Nadel, ACEEE executive director. “In this pandemic and recession, policymakers can embrace efficiency efforts to help residents reduce their utility bills and to get more people back to work, all while cutting pollution.”
The report, which examines policies and programs adopted through July, scores states on 32 metrics in five areas. No state earned all 50 possible points (California got 43), showing that each has considerable room for improvement. For the first time, the report highlights top scorers regionally:
California, in the top spot nationally and the West’s leader, has long been a trendsetter for its adoption of net zero energy building codes and stringent vehicle emissions standards. It has taken important steps to improve energy program access for low-income and disadvantaged communities and measure progress through energy equity indicators. The state has led the charge on vehicle electrification and has strengthened lighting and appliance standards amid federal rollback efforts.
Massachusetts (#2), the leader in the Northeast, continues to excel on multiple fronts, including advanced efforts to integrate and align efficiency rules with electrification and building decarbonization strategies.
Minnesota (#9), the Midwest’s leader, continues to report strong results from utility-run programs that help customers save energy and is developing draft rules for a Clean Cars program that would adopt California’s tailpipe and zero-emission vehicle standards.
Colorado (#11), the leader in the Southwest/Mountain region, is working on plans to meet statewide climate goals signed last year, which target a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In September, Governor Jared Polis released a roadmap to meet those goals.
Virginia (#25), the South/Southeast region’s leader and a top energy story of 2020, adopted its first-ever energy-saving target—known as an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS)—and raised minimum funding levels for efficiency programs for low-income, elderly, or disabled individuals as well as veterans. It became the first Southeastern state to set a 100% clean electricity goal.
Nevada (#21) was the most improved state in the scorecard, moving up five places. It has adopted standards for light bulbs, strengthened building energy codes, and moved to implement strong vehicle standards.
In contrast, Iowa (#36) fell the farthest in the rankings, losing 13 places. Its slide occurred primarily as a result of 2018 legislation that capped certain efficiency investments, leading to a steep decline in progress in reducing electricity and gas use.
The bottom five states, each earning 7 or fewer points, are Kansas (#47), Mississippi (#48), North Dakota (#48), West Virginia (#48) and Wyoming (#51).
In each region, the report identifies a “state to watch,” where promising developments are emerging. Along with Virginia, New Jersey (#17) is the most recent to adopt specific energy-saving targets for utilities, and regulators there are seeking to ensure that low-income customers have equitable access to energy efficiency programs. Michigan (#13) regulators recently approved utilities’ plans to expand efficiency programs, North Carolina (#27) is advancing opportunities to strengthen programs, and Arizona (#23) regulators recently approved a path toward 100% carbon-free electricity, including an extension and expansion of the state’s energy efficiency goals. Washington (#11) is working to implement 2019 laws requiring 100% clean energy by 2045 and a first-of-its-kind statewide standard for reducing energy use in existing large commercial buildings.
California Governor Gavin Newsom said: ""Energy efficiency has been a foundational part of California’s environmental efforts for the last four decades. Choosing to embrace a smarter way of using energy will save people and businesses money, and by leaning into energy efficient policies we will drive new technologies, creating the economy of the future.  That’s why I’m proud that California is receiving this top honor from ACEEE, recognizing not only the state’s national leadership but also the ongoing role energy efficiency continues to play as a key pillar in our economic health and our fight against the climate crisis. Good climate sense is good economic sense."" 
Colorado Governor Jared Polis said: “My administration is dedicated to achieving 100% renewable energy by 2040, reducing air pollution, and taking bold climate action across our economy. This work will protect the health and well-being of our residents and also generate enormous economic and job growth opportunities. We’ve made significant progress in meeting our goals, and continue to leverage our lowest cost resource—energy efficiency—to modernize the way we heat and power our homes and travel across the state.”
Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak said: “I’m proud to see Nevada leading the way on energy efficiency—an important part of what we can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I look forward to continuing our climate action progress in this arena and helping consumers save money on their energy bills.”
ACEEE found that a number of states have made efforts to foster equity in efficiency policies and programs. For example, multiple states, including California, New Jersey, and Oregon, have taken steps to expand programs for and better meet the needs of customers with lower incomes. Still, states can do much more to ensure that policy and program outcomes are equitable.
The report examined energy efficiency policies across five primary areas, identifying states that have adopted best practices in each, as well as opportunities ahead:
Energy-saving targets. Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont have adopted energy efficiency resource standards—with efficiency programs saving more than 2% of retail sales, the highest levels in the nation. As of 2020, 27 states have adopted some form of EERS.
Vehicle efficiency. Twelve states have adopted California’s Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV) standards and Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program. Many of these states, including California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington, have also set goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled or transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. Since late 2019, Minnesota, Nevada, and New Mexico have also moved forward with plans to adopt California’s vehicle emissions rules.
Building codes. Close to a dozen states and DC made significant progress strengthening efficiency standards for new construction. These include many states in which the 2018 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) has gone into effect in recent months, including Delaware, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Vermont. A new model code, the 2021 IECC, offers states an important opportunity to ensure that new buildings lock in low energy costs for generations of future residents.
Appliance and equipment standards. California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New York, Vermont, and Washington have each passed appliance standards updates since early 2019 that are expected to save consumers hundreds of millions of dollars on utility bills. A few of these standards counter rollbacks of federal standards.
State government initiatives. California, Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont led in in offering loan and grant programs to spur energy savings, setting efficiency standards for public buildings and fleets, and investing proceeds from carbon pricing policies in efficiency programs.
The scorecard, now in its 14th edition, is based on data collected from states, utilities, and numerous publicly available sources. Government staff members from all 50 states and Washington, DC, were given the opportunity to comment on a preliminary draft of the findings.

ACEEE Welcomes Biden Energy Secretary Pick Jennifer Granholm;"Washington, DC—The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released the following statement from Steven Nadel, its executive director, following multiple news reports that President-elect Joe Biden intends to nominate former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm to be secretary of energy.
“Jennifer Granholm is a proven climate leader who will enter the role with a formidable task ahead.
Her key challenge will be to move quickly and aggressively to harness the agency’s tremendous tools in the fight against climate change.
The Department of Energy needs to reorient its research and development agenda to find groundbreaking climate solutions and get them used widely. It needs a day one, aggressive effort to update appliance standards and support stronger building energy codes. It needs to implement ambitious programs to support local climate efforts, helping households and businesses slash their energy bills and greenhouse gas emissions. It needs a rejuvenated, fully staffed workforce backed by its leadership. I’m confident that Jennifer Granholm can realize this agenda and much more, and that the White House will support her every step of the way. Time is of the essence.”

Energy Efficiency Financing Must Grow to Meet Climate Goals: New Analysis Updates the Data;"Energy efficiency financing has grown more than 40% since 2014, reaching at least $7 billion annually, but it will need to increase significantly more to achieve urgent climate goals, according to an ACEEE analysis released today. This financing—in addition to grants, rebates, and other incentives—will enable a robust scaling of the energy-saving investments that are vital for reducing carbon emissions, improving equity in energy affordability, and spurring job creation.
Read the Topic Brief
Our analysis estimates that five major types of energy efficiency programs are responsible for nearly $7 billion in annual lending:
Commercial and Residential Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE and R-PACE)
State energy office (SEO) revolving loan funds (RLFs)
On-bill financing (OBF), on-bill repayment (OBR), and tariffed on-bill financing (TOB)
Utility financing programs (in which loans are not paid back on-bill)
Energy savings performance contracting (ESPC)
This represents growth of more than 40% since 2014, the most recent year for which we have comprehensive lending volume data from these programs. Our research builds on Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s 2016 technical brief Energy Efficiency Program Financing, which until now was the most recent assessment of efficiency financing. Our lending estimates are informed by data sourced from more than 120 financing programs via publicly available data and from direct outreach to program administrators, as well as market estimates for ESPC volume.
As shown in the chart below, energy efficiency lending has increased since 2014 across all programs covered in this research.
Annual programmatic energy efficiency lending volume. The scale on the right is for energy savings performance contracting (ESPC) data only; the scale on the left is for the remaining five programs. Source: 2014 numbers reported from LBNL’s Energy Efficiency Program Financing. Note that recent data vary in timeframe, hence the need to use 2017, 2018, and 2019 data.
  Annual energy efficiency lending via C-PACE has grown by nearly 2,500% since 2014, representing the largest growth among all programs covered in this research. C-PACE programs in Ohio and California each financed more than $100 million in energy efficiency projects in 2019. For perspective, these two leading states’ C-PACE programs financed more energy efficiency projects in 2019 than the entire nation in 2018. Likewise, 2019 saw the largest-ever PACE-financed project, a $54 million investment in the Salt Place Convention Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.
The largest and most robust programs we analyzed leverage primarily private capital sources to fund their loan portfolios. For example, Massachusetts’ Mass Save HEAT Loan program uses a network of nearly 100 local lenders to fund its nearly $160 million in energy efficiency loans.
The estimated $7 billion in annual programmatic financing for efficiency investments reflects a meaningful increase compared with prior years. While this growth is encouraging, financing needs to increase at least tenfold (to at least $70 billion) to ensure we make the efficiency upgrades necessary to help reach our climate and decarbonization goals. Energy efficiency investments are the most cost-effective way to reduce energy use. Building efficiency also creates a healthier indoor environment for occupants. Effective financing is essential if we are going to mitigate the upfront costs of implementing such improvements.
We would like to thank our friends at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), PACENation, the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO), the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI), and program administrators across the county for helping us procure all the data required to make this research possible.

Analysis: Bipartisan Bill to Spur Building Upgrades Would Cut Energy Costs and Emissions;"Washington, DC—A new bill to spur energy-efficiency upgrades in buildings would help save businesses and households a cumulative $15 billion on energy bills and reduce carbon emissions equivalent to those from 22 million cars and light trucks in a year, according to an analysis by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). The Energy Efficient Qualified Improvement Property (E-QUIP) Act, announced today by U.S. Reps. Brad Schneider (D-IL) and Tom Rice (R-SC), would amend federal tax law to provide accelerated depreciation for key energy efficiency upgrades in commercial and multifamily residential buildings.
Read the Policy Brief
Commercial and residential buildings are responsible for roughly one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, from both fuel burning on site and the emissions from power plants serving the buildings. But building owners are effectively disincentivized from making efficiency improvements because most such investments are not eligible for the immediate tax write-off available to other business investments under the 2017 tax law. Instead, they are subject to depreciation periods of 15 to 40 years—often far beyond the useful life of the new equipment—making the initial outlay a financial challenge.
The E-QUIP proposal would give building energy investments accelerated, uniform 10-year depreciation if they meet strict energy efficiency criteria. It would apply to heating and cooling equipment, lighting, controls for equipment and lighting (such as smart thermostats and occupancy and daylight sensors), and building shell components (roofs, insulation, and windows) installed through 2025.
“Many building owners want to make energy efficiency investments, but existing law disincentivizes them. This fix will help them upgrade from old equipment to state-of-the-art options that will reduce their energy bills while cutting carbon emissions,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of ACEEE. “Our analysis found that the plan from Representatives Schneider and Rice would spur needed energy efficiency updates.”
ACEEE modeled the economic and environmental impacts from the proposal if enacted, estimating that (in a main impact scenario) it would lead to:
130,000 net additional job-years (more people working for one year)
$15 billion energy bill savings (present value)
$11 billion added business and federal investment
100 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions avoided.

IEA: COVID-19 Cut Energy Efficiency Investments, But Efficiency Plays Notable Role In Global Economic Recovery Packages;"Energy efficiency is expected to attract less investment and employ fewer people this year because of COVID-19 and the resulting recession, but it is still figuring notably into global economic recovery packages, according to the 2020 edition of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) annual Energy Efficiency report released today. The new report also finds that efficiency helped offset 2019 increases in greenhouse gas emissions but at half the rate needed to meet climate goals.
Economic recovery packages
According to the IEA, more than $100 billion of clean energy-related recovery funding has been committed worldwide, of which more than half is going to efficiency-related spending. Europe dominates this spending, with more modest spending so far in Asia and North America. The largest share of investment is going to buildings efficiency, with major investments also in electric vehicles and urban infrastructure. as shown in the figure below.

IEA recommends further recovery investment in energy efficiency, because efficiency is typically labor intensive, creating jobs, and has a low cost per ton for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Impact of COVID-19
The IEA report finds that efficiency investments are down about 9% in 2020 because of COVID-19 and the recession. Businesses and households have less overall to invest. But with people at home more, insulation sales were up 20-40% in Australia and online shopping for appliances is up in many countries.
More broadly, energy use has decreased in the transportation, industrial, and commercial sectors but increased in the residential sector. In transportation, the declines are particularly steep for aviation (down about 60%), but also across the board as people stay closer to home. Public transit use is down (50% in some countries), but walking and bicycling are up. One potential silver lining is that some airlines are retiring old, inefficient planes, so the remaining fleet is more efficient.
In industry, energy use is down because of factory shutdowns and reduced product demand. Office and retail shutdowns also reduce commercial-sector energy use, but residential energy use is up as more people work from home.
2019 greenhouse gas emissions
The IEA report looks at changes in greenhouse gas emissions between 2018 and 2019. It finds that energy-using activities increased in 2019, but the emissions did not increase because of a variety of factors including renewable energy, energy efficiency (the second largest contributor), coal-to-gas conversions, nuclear energy, and weather. The relative contributions of efficiency relative to other factors are shown in the figure below. Despite efficiency's contribution, energy intensity — energy produced per dollar of economic activity — improved only 1.6% in 2019, which is about half the amount that the IEA projects is needed to achieve long-term global climate goals. The report expects energy intensity to improve even less, 0.8%, in 2020.

Conclusion
This has been an unusual and challenging year. The IEA report illustrates some of the challenges but also provides reason for hope, particularly if energy efficiency is a substantial part of economic recovery efforts, as is the case in a number of countries already and in President-elect Biden’s planned “Build Back Better” program.

DC Joins Leading States In Setting Strong Appliance Efficiency Standards;"Washington, DC is set to become the eighth U.S. jurisdiction to adopt energy-saving standards for common household and commercial products since the start of the Trump administration. On Tuesday afternoon, the DC Council voted unanimously in support of the measure, which will cut utility bills for consumers and businesses and help meet the district’s target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2032.
In 2025 alone, the bill will save consumers and businesses $19 million and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 25,000 metric tons, equivalent to taking 5,400 automobiles off the road. Savings climb to $54 million annually by 2035.
The bill (B23-0204), sponsored by Councilmember Mary Cheh, adopts energy and water efficiency standards for 15 products including faucets, showerheads, water coolers, and commercial cooking equipment. All states and DC have the power to set standards for products that do not have federal standards, and in some cases—plumbing products, for example—when the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has waived federal preemption. With its new bill, DC joins California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New York, Vermont, and Washington in adopting new appliance standards since 2017, several of which counteract federal rollbacks.
The bill includes efficiency standards for certain light bulbs, including many types of cone-shaped bulbs used frequently in recessed lighting. With these provisions, DC will become the sixth jurisdiction to essentially counter part of the Trump administration’s rollbacks of bulb standards, and consumers in these jurisdictions will soon see more efficient products on store shelves (manufacturers of inefficient bulbs opposed the bill, without success).
Notably, DC is first in the nation to set standards for air purifiers—a product in high demand during the pandemic. Currently, about 45% of models already meet the new minimum efficiency levels. The DC standards will ensure that all air purifiers sold in the District meet those minimum efficiency levels. The new standards will cut energy waste by 40%, saving the average consumer about $30 a year, or nearly $270 over the life of a typical air purifier.
The passage of this bill and others like it have been crucial to advancing efficiency on the state level while the Trump administration’s DOE has stalled, delayed, and rolled back standards on the federal level. Over the last four years, DOE has missed deadlines for updating standards for nearly 30 products. The Biden administration will have to play catch up on these overdue federal standards. The products in the DC bill are—for the most part—not included in the federal standards program, so more states and local jurisdictions need to act by setting their own standards. Climate change isn’t taking a break and federal, state, and local governments can’t either.  
Legislators in about a dozen states, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, have already filed, or indicated they plan to file appliance standards legislation similar to the DC bill.
The bill will go into effect one year after final approval.

Reclaim The Sharing Economy For Sustainability: Q&A With BECC Keynoter Juliet Schor;"Amid the horrific health and economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’re seeing dramatic shifts in people’s daily ways of life—all while a new president is set to take office. In this time of great uncertainty, is there the chance to make the necessary leap to a sustainable and equitable future?
The potential of such a grand shift is encompassed in the theme of this year’s Behavior, Energy & Climate Change Conference (BECC), From Nudge to Leap. The theme calls for us to move from small, incremental behavioral changes to major leaps in systems and behaviors to fast-track a low-carbon future.
In its 14th year, the BECC conference, starting on December 7, will explore topics that include climate change communication, mobility in a post-COVID world, corporate sustainability, maximizing energy savings through building policies, and energy efficiency education in underserved communities.
Register for BECC 2020
  Juliet Schor, author and sociology professor at Boston College, will deliver the opening plenary keynote. She will report on a decade of research on the “sharing economy,” including both the large corporate platforms and smaller community initiatives and their impacts on energy and the climate.
Dr. Schor spoke with us to share her thoughts on shifting from behavioral nudges toward scaling sustainable solutions. Here are excerpts of our conversation.
What made you first start to care about human behavior and the environment?
I came of age in the 60s and 70s, so caring about the natural world was very much a part of the political culture at that time. It wasn’t a particular passion of mine, however. I believe I was first really attuned to issues of ecological overshoot in the mid-1980s when I got together with my husband. He showed me the fatuity of the economists’ view (which I held then) that technology would make it possible for everyone to live like Americans.
You have written a lot on the idea that a truly sustainable future would be a plentiful future. Most people assume living sustainably means making great sacrifices. How can we live plentifully without making sacrifices?
I think the keys are time, meaning, and community, or deep social connections. Those are the things that give true satisfaction and well-being. Chasing an escalating consumption standard crowds out those three dimensions. In my view, we will achieve sustainability when we start taking productivity growth in the form of more free time rather than more income. As we do that, we will deepen social connections because they require time, people will have the ability to spend their time doing what’s meaningful for them, and they will have richer lives. Sacrifice is what happens when we live in a decaying, dying natural world. We are sacrificing our well-being to chase a tawdry dream.
What role would the shared economy ideally play in a plentiful world?
Sharing is at the core of sustainability. We have to share ecological space, technology, and wealth. The “sharing economy” as we know it today could be a part of a plenitude economy if we can reclaim it from investors and shareholders. In transport, goods, and accommodations, it allows us to use what we have more sustainably. However, it’s important to note that where sharing platforms reduce prices—as they have in accommodations and rides—they raise eco-impact because they spur demand. There are old forms of sharing—public libraries, public transportation—that are clearly low carbon footprint.
How can BECC participants leverage their vast experience and resources to help bring about the sharing economy that you envision?
Community sharing platforms need money, expertise, and promotion. BECC members can provide those.
We know that, with some effort, we can nudge people in the right direction, but how can we help society take big leaps toward a more sustainable future?
Exiting what I’ve called the “work and spend” cycle is the big leap. If we, as a society, decide to make better use of what we already have, including more equal distribution, we can use productivity growth to reduce hours of work and reclaim time. That’ll spur more-frugal consumption habits and a shift to reuse, repair, and second-hand markets—new sharing forms.

Groups Urge Biden to Use Existing Authorities to Cut Energy Waste, Carbon from Buildings;"New ACEEE briefs give detailed recommendations for manufactured and federally backed housing, federal buildings
  Washington, DC—In a Biden administration, half a dozen federal agencies should use their authority under existing laws to create jobs, reduce consumers’ utility bills, and mitigate climate change by reducing energy waste from homes and buildings, a coalition of groups urged the President-elect in a letter Monday. The letter was signed by 27 organizations, including energy efficiency advocates, business associations, and environmental and consumer groups.
Energy use in homes and commercial buildings is responsible for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, as well as more than $400 billion in energy bills each year. But much of that energy is wasted, such as from poorly sealed buildings using out-of-date equipment.
The agenda in the letter embraces and expands on proposals published by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) in three issue briefs today (as well as in a report on appliance standards released last week).
“A whole bunch of federal agencies already have the authority to act now to greatly reduce energy waste in buildings,” said Lowell Ungar, ACEEE director of federal policy and author of the issue briefs. “Wasteful homes and buildings are just not compatible with tackling the climate crisis. Starting in January, President Biden and his administration should take every opportunity available to spur far more efficient new construction and building improvements.”
The ACEEE briefs and coalition letter from 20 groups call for the Biden administration to:
Ensure new federally assisted housing is efficient. About half of home loans are supported by federally regulated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, yet they currently lack any protections to prevent inefficient housing with significant energy waste and high utility bills. At least 15% of new homes have federally assisted loans or other federal assistance with energy efficiency criteria that are badly out of date. Regulators can ensure that all new newly constructed housing with federal assistance meets up-to-date efficiency requirements. (Agencies: Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, and Federal Housing Finance Agency)
Set a strong energy efficiency standard for manufactured homes. More than 100,000 manufactured homes are shipped each year. Most occupants have low incomes, and many are burdened by high energy bills, in part because federal efficiency standards for these homes have not been updated since 1994. The Department of Energy should set standards promptly, and HUD should strengthen ventilation requirements to ensure better air quality.
Issue an executive order to improve the efficiency of federal buildings. The federal government should be a leader on deep energy and water efficiency retrofits of existing building and constructing zero-net-energy and zero-carbon buildings (i.e., buildings that, over the course of a year, emit zero carbon and generate as much energy as they use). But progress has stagnated in recent years, and President Trump eliminated targets for annual improvement in the efficiency of these buildings. The new president should issue an executive order spurring federal agencies to meet new goals, increase transparency, and leverage private and innovative financing.
The letter also calls on the Biden administration to:
Revive appliance efficiency standards. Appliance standards are the most important federal energy and climate program for buildings. Updating standards could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.5 to 3 billion tons by 2050. DOE should reverse Trump administration changes that added hurdles to development of new standards, implement light bulb standards that had been legally set to take effect this year, set standards for residential furnaces and commercial water heaters, and expedite dozens of standards due for updates by the end of 2024.
Strengthen agency work to drive energy efficiency. Accomplishing the above will require quickly filling vacancies in understaffed agencies, especially DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. And federal efforts to help deploy new technologies need new focus and support. DOE should redouble efforts to help state and local efforts to strengthen building energy codes, implement building performance standards, and integrate smart homes and commercial buildings in a carbon-free electric grid, while EPA should devote new focus and support to the ENERGY STAR® program.
The letter to President-elect Biden was signed by Advanced Energy Economy, Alliance to Save Energy, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, American Institute of Architects, Building Performance Association, California Efficiency + Demand Management Council, Ceres, Consumer Federation of America, DesignLights Consortium, E4TheFuture, Energy Efficiency Alliance, Environmental and Energy Study Institute, Institute for Market Transformation, Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, National Association of State Energy Officials, National Consumer Law Center, on behalf of its low-income clients, North American Insulation Manufacturers Association, Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships, NRDC, Sierra Club, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, South-central Partnership for Energy Efficiency as a Resource, Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance, Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, Union of Concerned Scientists, U.S. Green Building Council, and VEIC.

Back To School: How To Create COVID-Safe And Sustainable Learning Environments;"This post is the second in a series focused on the energy efficiency implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and a safe, sustainable recovery. The first post explored ways to reduce transmission risks in buildings without wasting excess energy.
Communities across the country are grappling with how and when kids can safely return to school after the long—and, for those of us with school-age children—challenging period of distance learning. These communities and those where schools have reopened have great concern about improving the safety of school buildings in light of COVID-19 and preparing for future disease outbreaks.
The good news is that schools and policymakers can take steps now to create safe, sustainable learning environments that could deliver long-term energy savings. Indeed, some efforts are already underway. As the pandemic continues to delay school reopening or causes reopened schools to close again, there is an opportunity to make much-needed investments to upgrade and replace HVAC systems while schools are unoccupied.
What can schools do?
Schools can follow guidance developed by ASHRAE and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for safely reopening and maintaining their facilities. This guidance, including a set of checklists, generally aligns with the recommendations outlined in our prior post, but with some considerations specific to schools:
Develop and enforce mitigation strategies such as social distancing, wearing masks, hand washing, and cleaning tailored to the school, student age group, and staff/faculty needs.
Modify operating procedures to meet reduced occupancy levels, alternate schedules, and revised cleaning and sanitation routines.
Retrofit or upgrade building systems to meet the latest guidance for adequate ventilation, filtration, and HVAC operations.
Create or designate an isolation space such as a nurse’s suite or office for students who develop symptoms while at school. Ideally, it can be outfitted to operate in isolation mode with a dedicated 100% outdoor air system.
In addition, upgrades to building systems can also be an opportunity to improve system energy efficiency.
Schools already face challenges
The need to improve HVAC systems in response to COVID-19 comes at a time when school facilities are already grappling with an enormous backlog of projects to address deferred maintenance and overdue capital improvements. A recent study by the federal General Accountability Office estimates that as of late 2019, HVAC system replacements and upgrades are needed in as many as 45,000 schools across the United States.
Even before the pandemic, outdated, underperforming, or non-functional HVAC systems contributed to uncomfortable, and sometimes extreme, temperature conditions, poor indoor air quality associated with mold and mildew, and the need for school closures or early dismissals. The GAO study found that many districts have put off critical facilities’ upgrades and directed funds to security measures to protect students, faculty, and staff in case of school shootings or to priority IT upgrades.
The COVID-19 pandemic’s negative impact on state and local tax revenues is leading to budget cuts in many school districts. Tighter budget constraints make funding for critical HVAC upgrades an even more daunting challenge. School administrators estimate the average school district—with 3,600 students and 8 school buildings—will incur roughly $1.8 million in reopening expenses for personal protective equipment, added staff, and other supplies required to implement cleaning, disinfecting, and health and safety protocols.
States and federal government take steps
States and the federal government are taking steps to help schools address the most immediate needs. The federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March included $30.75 billion for schools and higher education, significantly less than the $100 billion provided through the 2009 ARRA stimulus package. Some states are using these funds or allocating other funding to provide resources for HVAC repairs and upgrades to improve health, safety and energy efficiency. Pending stimulus legislation passed by the House (the HEROES 2.0 Act) includes $225 billion in additional funding for schools and higher education, with $5 billion designated for K-12 facility repairs necessary for safe reopening.
The Vermont legislature created the School Indoor Air Quality Grant Program to direct a portion of the state’s CARES funding toward projects to improve indoor air quality and health in schools. As program administrator, Efficiency Vermont is working with public schools on projects to repair, maintain, and upgrade HVAC systems in accordance with CDC and ASHRAE ventilation and filtration guidelines. In accordance with CARES requirements, projects must be completed by December 31, 2020. 
Through the program, eligible Vermont schools will receive monitors to measure carbon dioxide and other indicators of indoor air quality and a minimum of $2,500 for projects, while funds last. Efficiency Vermont is prioritizing grant applications by system needs, location, and school size. No cap has been established for project funding and the program expects to cover all costs associated with projects meeting the COVID-specific guidelines. Schools may also be eligible to leverage other efficiency program funding from Efficiency Vermont or their local utility. As of November, 319 of the state’s 412 eligible schools had applied for program funds.
This fall, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill (AB) 841 directing the state’s investor-owned utilities to allocate efficiency funds to a joint School Energy Efficiency Stimulus Program over the 2021-2023 program years. The program will provide grants to schools for HVAC system testing prior to reopening and, where needed, for repairs or replacement to improve efficiency and overall performance. The law provides specific guidance and requirements for ventilation system performance and filtration to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 transmission.
These improvements will help address the risks from wildfire smoke exposure. Funding can also be used to replace aging water fixtures and appliances with new, standard-compliant models to conserve water and reduce the risk of lead contamination. One-fourth of the funding is reserved for schools in underserved communities; these schools will be given priority in applying for and receiving grants. Priority will also be given to schools located near freeways or industrial facilities.
These efforts show what schools and policymakers can do to address their COVID-related concerns. The investments will pay off through safer, healthier, and more productive school environments, reduced energy and maintenance costs, and more efficient and sustainable facilities in the near term and long after the nation recovers from the ravages of COVID-19.

Canada and COVID: Great Ambition, Some Progress On An Energy-efficient Recovery;"Like most parts of the world, Canada continues to grapple with the twin health and economic crises created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Swift action in the spring led to unprecedented spending by the federal Liberal government to provide emergency benefits to more than 8.9 million individuals and enable rent relief and wage subsidies for businesses.
While a brief decline in cases during the summer enabled some space to discuss Canada’s economic recovery, a second wave this fall has again placed immediate focus on managing the pandemic. However, the government has also clearly stated an intention to ""build back better"" and put energy efficiency front and center in this agenda. It has announced CAD$2 billion in financing to invest in building retrofits and project development, with more likely on the way.
At Efficiency Canada—the national voice for an energy-efficient economy—we have been advocating for efficiency as a tool for economic recovery through our research, communication, and engagement. Despite the relentless advancement of COVID-19, there is some momentum on building back better and greener; this can be characterized as “great ambition, with some progress.”
Here’s a snapshot of what’s happening in Canada, where climate change was a central policy issue in last year’s election. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party narrowly won the election but lost its majority in the House of Commons. As a result, to pass bills and advance its agenda, it needs support from either the official Opposition Conservative Party or the more left-leaning Bloc Quebecois, New Democrat Party, or Green Party. 
Great ambition
The Liberal party embedded energy efficiency in its campaign platform and subsequent mandate letters to relevant departments. It promised to provide free energy audits and interest-free loans to retrofit 1.5 million homes, invest in training and workforce development, and develop a CAD$400 million financing scheme for deep retrofits of commercial buildings.
Indeed, all opposition parties featured energy efficiency measures in their 2019 election platforms, prompting optimism that such efforts would make it into the Spring 2020 budget. The platforms supported everything from stronger building codes and tax credits, to aggressive retrofit targets and Canadian versions of a Green New Deal.
However, with countrywide lockdowns starting in March, those plans were shelved.
Recovery agenda
Throughout the spring and summer, economic recovery was on everyone’s minds in Ottawa, our nation’s capital. We joined a coalition of civil society groups to define a “resilient recovery” agenda, characterized by recovery plans being not only “shovel-ready,” but also “shovel-worthy.” We also continued our advocacy work, considering specific policy actions in three stages: relief, stimulus, and recovery.
The relief stage recognizes the need to provide immediate support for citizens and businesses while physical distancing measures help us reduce the virus’ transmission and alleviate pressure on our healthcare system. The stimulus stage considers activities that can deliver results in 6–12 months to get people back to work, by using existing administrative capabilities and policy programs. And the recovery stage recognizes the critical need to rebuild a more economically and environmentally sustainable economy in the long term.
This resulted in five specific recommendations to invest in workforce training, regional efficiency programs and financing, a retrofit “mission,” and stronger building codes. These recommendations would create more than 132,000 jobs annually, boost average annual GDP by CAD$32 billion, and prevent 20.4 MT of emissions. They were also featured as a core component of a report by the Task Force for a Resilient Recovery, a non-partisan, independent group of Canadian finance, policy, and sustainability leaders.
Some progress
In September, the Canadian government issued a “Speech from the Throne” (yes, it’s filled with all of the pomp and ceremony you would expect from its title), outlining its priorities for a renewed mandate. Once again, it prominently featured energy efficiency as a core element for creating one million new jobs as part of its recovery agenda.
On the heels of the Throne Speech, the Canada Infrastructure Bank (CIB) announced CAD$2 billion in financing to “invest in large-scale building retrofits to increase energy efficiency and help make communities more sustainable” and “$500 million for project development and early construction works.” 
The CIB announcement sent a strong signal that the federal government recognizes the widespread and long-term impacts of building retrofits. During a time when Canada continues to experience COVID-19’s second wave, it is imperative that this early signal leads to increased investment that prepares the market for large-scale activities.
There’s a lot more that can be done, including investing in training and workforce development, crafting a robust strategy for residential and low-income retrofits, determining ways to boost retrofit innovation, and accelerating the adoption of net-zero-energy-ready building codes. Each of these activities—combined with budget announcements for long-term program spending—would back up the government’s ambitious promises, all while helping Canada get its economy back on track.

Report: Biden Could Slash Carbon Pollution, Energy Costs with Efficiency Standards;"Washington, DC—The Biden administration could slash carbon emissions and save the average American household $230 annually on utility bills by 2035 through strengthening energy efficiency standards for appliances and equipment, according to a new report by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
Researchers estimated the potential of the Department of Energy (DOE) setting or strengthening standards for 47 products, such as water heaters and refrigerators, over the next several years. They found that these updates could cut carbon emissions over the next three decades by an amount equivalent to eliminating at least 13 coal-fired power plants.

“We have good news for a president-elect who pledged to set aggressive new appliance standards: he’ll significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce utility bills,” said Steven Nadel, ACEEE executive director. “Strong new appliance standards are imperative for the climate. We have to get more-efficient appliances and equipment in place quickly, and the Biden administration can get started from day one.”
Joanna Mauer, ASAP technical advocacy manager and lead report author, said, “Standards have already made these products more efficient, but the technology keeps advancing and the standards have fallen behind.” She added: “Whether it’s water heaters or furnaces, if we keep installing models that use yesterday’s less-efficient technology, we’ll lock in needless energy costs and carbon emissions for decades to come. Strengthening standards ensures everyone has lower costs.”
In a series of laws over the past four decades, Congress has set and ordered DOE to periodically update efficiency standards for dozens of products, setting a minimum level of energy or water efficiency performance that products manufactured for sale in the United States must meet. In most cases, DOE is required by law to evaluate the standards and consider strengthening them every six years. However, the current administration has not completed a single rulemaking to update appliance standards. DOE has now missed legal deadlines for considering updates to 28 separate standards; it was recently sued by environmental groups and state attorneys general over these delays.
The report finds that by updating standards, the Biden administration could:
Reduce cumulative carbon dioxide emissions through 2050 by 1.5–2.9 billion metric tons, which is equivalent to the emissions of approximately 13–25 average-size coal-fired power plants over that period (the range depends on the rate at which electricity production becomes less carbon intensive in the years ahead).
Reduce annual average household utility bills by more than $100 in 2030, by $230 in 2035, and by nearly $350 in 2050. The potential cumulative utility bill savings through 2050 for consumers and businesses are $1.1 trillion.
Reduce peak electricity demand by almost 90 gigawatts by 2050, which is equivalent to about 13% of current total peak demand, allowing for faster decarbonization of the electric grid at a lower cost.
The ASAP/ACEEE report finds that strengthened standards for residential water heaters, commercial and industrial fans, residential furnaces, and light bulbs could provide the greatest potential emissions reductions. But updates to 45 standards and new standards for 2 products would be needed to achieve the total savings projected.
For each product considered, ASAP and ACEEE researchers estimated potential savings from a new standard that could be met using current technology. DOE could adopt the standards through rulemakings completed over the next few years.
DOE could achieve even greater emissions reductions than calculated in the report by setting standards for products that do not currently have any standard, such as air purifiers and computers, and by improving test procedures used to rate products’ energy and water use to better represent actual usage.
What they’re saying:
Ben Evans, vice president of public affairs at the Alliance to Save Energy, said: “These standards are the unsung heroes of energy policy. They reduce strain on the grid, significantly drive down greenhouse gas emissions, and save us all money, particularly low-income households that are struggling to pay their energy bills. Getting these standards back on track should be a top priority for the Biden administration.”
Mel Hall-Crawford, energy programs director at the Consumer Federation of America, said: “Now more than ever, American households can use additional pocketbook savings that energy efficiency standards can deliver. Appliance efficiency standards have consistently proven they provide meaningful benefits to consumers in the form of lower utility bills, as well as significant reductions in carbon emissions. This report is an excellent blueprint for the Department of Energy as it looks ahead to meeting its responsibility of advancing needed cost-effective energy efficiency standards that benefit consumers and also help address climate change.”
Charlie Harak, senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, said: ""Cost-effective standards for appliances provide hundreds of dollars of benefits annually for low-income households. Moreover, federal standards are essential because these households are quite disproportionately renters, not owners. In the absence of standards, owners often buy highly inefficient appliances because it's the tenants who usually end up paying the energy bills. Federal standards help protect tenants from being saddled with unaffordable utility bills.""
Kit Kennedy, senior director of NRDC’s climate & clean energy program, said: “Energy efficiency is the strongest, fastest, cleanest weapon against the climate crisis. It’s critical that the Biden administration take swift, aggressive action to get our national efficiency standards program back on track. Stronger standards help consumers save money on energy bills, reduce energy burdens for low-income Americans and communities of color, slash pollution and create jobs—all so important during the pandemic.”

Biden’s Election Offers Opportunity to Cut Energy Emissions and Fight Climate Change;"Washington, D.C.—The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released the following statement from Steven Nadel, its executive director, after major news organizations projected Joe Biden to be the winner of the presidential election.
“We congratulate Vice President Joe Biden on his 2020 presidential victory and welcome his commitment to scale up energy efficiency and confront the climate crisis.
His election offers the United States a historic opportunity to use energy efficiency to deliver the urgent and bold action needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions. With robust investments, efficiency can halve U.S. carbon emissions by midcentury and buoy economic recovery by creating good-paying local jobs.
We urge the Biden administration to work together with a closely divided Congress to incorporate energy efficiency into a recovery package, to invest in weatherizing homes and in the research and development of energy-saving technologies, and to pursue new bipartisan transportation and energy legislation. We also urge the Biden administration to adopt strong energy-saving standards for light bulbs, appliances, equipment, cars, trucks, and other vehicles.
We cannot stop there. ACEEE’s Call to Action, released this year as part of our 40th anniversary, offers a roadmap for ambitious, equitable action that shares elements of Biden’s climate plan. We urge President-elect Biden to make his efficiency and clean energy proposals a top priority, including the retrofit of four million buildings, as well as investments in half a million electric vehicle charging stations and research to decarbonize key industrial processes.
We recognize that there will be challenges ahead, but the rapid transformation needed to address the climate crisis is achievable. It will make our economy stronger, our air cleaner, and our communities healthier and more resilient. We must do this and much more. We have no other choice.”

Utilities Can Diversify The Energy Efficiency Workforce. Here’s How.;"The energy efficiency sector is the largest employer in the clean energy economy. It offers competitive pay, but not everyone is benefiting from this economic powerhouse: Hispanic people, Black people, and women represent a smaller share of the energy efficiency workforce than the national workforce. However, programs around the country are increasingly using focused outreach and training to bring people from underrepresented groups into the energy efficiency field.
An ACEEE report released today highlights several exemplary programs operated by utilities, state agencies, and community-based organizations and the strategies they are finding successful. In conjunction with the report, a newly launched four-month learning group, led by ACEEE, welcomes participants who want to learn more about prioritizing diversity and inclusion in energy efficiency workforce development.

Efficiency jobs pay more than the national average
On average, efficiency jobs pay between $2 to $5 per hour more than the average national wage. This difference is especially important in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout, as these jobs can help unemployed workers get back on their feet financially.
Before the pandemic, employers expressed difficulty finding qualified energy efficiency workers, often citing candidates’ lack of experience, training, or technical skills. As utilities, state agencies, and program administrators resume efficiency programs and look to prepare the workforce of the future, they can offer programs that engage underrepresented workers. 
Utilities and other administrators of ratepayer-funded efficiency programs spend about $8 billion annually working with millions of energy efficiency workers. Given that the efficiency workforce lacks diversity, utilities and efficiency program administrators can play an important role in making it more inclusive. They often know which efficiency technologies and services their customers and constituents will seek, as well as the types of skills and workers necessary to deliver them. For example, a utility with a whole-home upgrade program knows that it will need workers to handle system upgrades and install individual efficiency measures.
Here are two strategies used by programs leading the way on inclusive workforce development:
Engage people from underrepresented groups with training and internship programs
To increase the pipeline of workers from underrepresented groups, utilities, state agencies, and program administrators can offer training programs to contracting firms. When firms complete such trainings, they become eligible to participate in delivering efficiency programs. Utilities, state agencies, and program administrators can also offer internships to students from underrepresented groups.
As part of its Workforce Training Investment Plan, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) will spend more than $100 million through 2025 on clean energy and energy efficiency workforce development and training. In disbursing funds, NYSERDA focuses first on projects that train and provide job placement services to priority populations, such as communities located near environmental hazards and low-income individuals.
NYSERDA requires that trainers and contractors demonstrate that any clean energy training they are offering new workers is in direct response to business hiring needs. The agency funds training for workers, as well as an internship program for students, recent graduates, and people from other priority populations.

Focus on supplier diversity and inclusive procurement
Utilities can choose to work with minority-, women-, disabled-, and veteran-owned business enterprises to design, administer, and implement their energy efficiency programs. They can offer these firms technical training, business development support, and help qualifying as contractors who deliver their efficiency programs.
Earlier this year, through its Diverse Energy Efficiency Service Provider Incubator Program, Illinois investor-owned utility Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) trained minority-, women-, disabled-, and veteran-owned contracting firms on its portfolio offerings. The utility also provided these firms with administrative support, helped them obtain necessary certifications, and worked with them to secure financing for equipment. ComEd collaborated with community-based workforce development organizations to recruit contracting firms into its program and provide them back-office support.
Energy efficiency as a pathway to a more inclusive economy
Through the diversity and inclusion strategies we explore in this research, program administrators can introduce well-paying energy efficiency jobs to individuals who have historically been excluded from this sector of the economy. From supplier initiatives to internship programs, the workforce development programs we identified demonstrate that diversity in energy efficiency begins with equipping people with skills and connecting them with employment opportunities. Doing this requires a conscious, intentional effort to address the obstacles that have historically excluded women and people of color from the energy efficiency workforce and other paths of economic inclusion.

Report: Electrifying Heating in Existing Commercial Buildings Could Cut Their Emissions 44%;"Washington, DC—Replacing gas-burning heating systems in commercial buildings with efficient electrified heat-pumps could reduce these buildings’ total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 44%, according to a new report by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). The conversions would help enable the buildings to ultimately become “zero carbon” as the electric grid moves toward renewable energy sources. But policymakers will need to act to spur a widespread shift to heat pumps.
Read the Report
Register for the report webinar on Nov. 2
Buildings are responsible for nearly one-third of GHG emissions in the United States, both from fuel burning on site and the emissions from power plants serving the buildings. The new report models the impacts of replacing several types of gas-based heating systems in existing commercial buildings with various electric heat pump systems.
In some cases, electrifying heating already pays back for building owners. ACEEE found that about 27% of commercial floor space heated with fossil fuel systems can be electrified today with a simple payback of less than 10 years. If policymakers enacted a package of public investments, incentives, and carbon pricing policies, the proportion of commercial building space that can be electrified with this payback would increase to 60%. But electrification of remaining buildings would likely require more-aggressive policies or government investments.
“Ultimately, we’re going to need to upgrade most building heating systems to electric heat pumps, running on renewable energy, to get to zero emissions,” said Steven Nadel, ACEEE executive director and co-author of the report. “Heat pumps use less energy and reduce building operating costs, but the upgrade is often a tough sell for building owners when payback periods are long. Policymakers are going to need to make major investments in incentivizing the technology to get it adopted widely.”
ACEEE analyzed converting packaged heat systems, furnaces, boilers, and space heaters for a range of actual buildings across all regions. Researchers found that the economics of switching to heat pumps vary widely. Buildings with the shortest paybacks are more likely to be located in the southern United States and the Pacific region, where space-heating needs are modest, and in building types across the country that often have medium-to-long operating hours, such as healthcare, food, retail, and offices.
The report says that the economic case for upgrading to heat pumps can improve for building owners if:
Policymakers improve incentives and institute a fee on GHG emissions
Building owners institute other energy efficiency measures to reduce heating load at the same time as installing heat pumps
Policymakers invest in research and development that could reduce the initial cost of heat pumps.
The report also recommends that policymakers encourage or require building owners to get a heat pump bid whenever an existing fossil fuel heating system needs to be replaced.
Even with the proposed policy support and incentives, electrifying space heating in some types of buildings, such as those with complex heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems or in cold climates, may still prove challenging. The report says that for many buildings, a viable strategy in many cases may be to electrify most of the heating load but continue to have a fuel-based backup for use on very cold days.

Arizona Regulators Poised To Expand Efficiency Targets In Clean Energy Rules;"In a decisive 4-1 vote this month, the bipartisan members of the Arizona Corporation Commission heralded a new era for energy efficiency in Arizona, setting new targets utilities must achieve through demand side management programs to help customers save energy and money on their utility bills. The regulators included the policy as part of a broader clean energy rulemaking package that is set for final consideration on Thursday. The package could shape the state’s energy system for years to come.
The much-anticipated vote on Oct. 14, which extended and expanded the state’s existing energy efficiency resource standard (EERS) for electric utilities, couldn’t come at a more important time for ratepayers and the tens of thousands of workers supporting energy-saving programs and services across the state. These programs are vital for to putting Arizonans back to work as part of the economic recovery and for helping customers save money on their energy bills. And with Phoenix recently setting a new annual record of 145 days at or above 100 degrees, the price for keeping homes cool can quickly add up for residents living in inefficient homes in the region. All too often those residents are low and moderate-income individuals.
The stakes were high going into this month’s meeting because the state’s current EERS, which passed unanimously with bipartisan support 10 years ago, was set to expire in December. That standard required utility efficiency programs to achieve at least 22% cumulative annual energy savings by the end of 2020 and has saved ratepayers more than $1.4 billion.
The new rules, filed as an amendment to the pending clean energy rule, include a capacity-based standard requiring savings equal to a 35% reduction in 2020 peak demand by 2030. They also have an annual MWh savings target of 1.3% (averaged over each 3-year planning period) to ensure that a minimum level of investment is maintained in cost-effective energy efficiency programs. The targets would revitalize Arizona’s commitment to energy efficiency. Although since 2010 utility efficiency programs have returned almost $4 in ratepayer benefits for every $1 spent, saved more than billions of gallons of water, and created more than 40,000 jobs across the state in recent years, the policy commitment has been uncertain. This new rule would provide a good foundation for progress.
Encouraging trends on efficiency targets, clean energy standards
Though 2020 has offered little to celebrate, Arizona regulators’ recent decision is a welcome bit of good news for the Southwest and the latest in a string of victories for state efficiency standards across the United States in recent months. Currently 27 states, including Arizona’s neighbors California, Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico, have adopted binding energy savings targets for utility efficiency programs. The most recent additions have been Virginia, where this year lawmakers passed the state’s first ever EERS while charting a path to 100% clean electricity, and New Jersey, where, in June, regulators passed an order finalizing ambitious goals for the state’s utilities to save electricity and natural gas.
At the same time, a growing number of states are adopting ambitious clean energy goals, like those proposed in Arizona, that seek to zero out emissions in the power sector, and in some cases across the economy. In the past two years, nine states―California, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, and Virginia, plus Washington, D.C.―have passed legislation or announced administrative goals to reach power sector carbon neutrality or reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 100%. Ramping up energy efficiency efforts will be necessary to achieve these goals cost effectively, as efficiency reduces loads and the amount of renewable energy and other resources needed. In Arizona, at times of peak demand when the desert heat and changing climate are pushing temperatures into the triple digits, those savings become a key asset for managing grid reliability and reducing costs.
Arizona policy near the finish line
The new Arizona efficiency standard was the product of many years of hard work and discussions among regulators, Commission Staff, and stakeholders. The Southwest Energy Efficiency Project (SWEEP), Arizona PIRG Education Fund, and Wildfire championed an amendment offered by Commissioner Boyd Dunn (R) that became the Arizona Corporation Commission’s new official policy.
The standards could signal a turning point and resurgent new wave for utility-led energy efficiency efforts in the state, which have suffered from underinvestment in recent years, as well from COVID-19 setbacks. The decision also builds on the momentum of the Commission’s recent approval of Arizona Public Service Company’s 2020 energy efficiency plan, which directs much-needed resources toward improvements in homes, businesses, schools, and low-income households, including specifically to serve households and businesses suffering economically because of the pandemic. Those investments are sure to reduce utility bills and boost the state’s economy. 
While much remains uncertain as to how utilities choose to meet the new goals, the recent vote is a promising declaration recognizing efficiency as a vital least cost energy resource and embracing its role in the economic recovery and clean energy transition. The Commission will vote on Thursday on the full comprehensive clean energy rules package and then will need to complete a hearing process before finalizing the rules. Given the timing of next month’s Commission election, with three open seats, implementation of the rulemaking will fall to the next commission. But the resounding bipartisan vote in favor of the standard lays an important regulatory foundation for efficiency programs going forward.

Energy Department’s Dishwasher Rule Finds Nothing to Fix;"Washington, DC — A dishwasher regulation announced by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today—heralded repeatedly by President Trump over the past year—will do nothing to improve today’s machines, which perform far more effectively than older models even while using less energy and water.
The new DOE final rule creates a separate “product class” for dishwashers with a short cycle as the “normal” cycle and sets no limit on their energy or water use. However, the vast majority of today’s dishwashers already offer short cycles, which in some instances consume modestly more energy than the default cycles but are used infrequently according to surveys.
“The president and the Department of Energy have given two completely different reasons for why this rule is needed, and neither makes sense,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “President Trump says dishwashers don’t work as well as they used to, yet tests find that today’s models clean far better than the old ones. The Department of Energy says consumers need options for quick cycles, but those are already ubiquitous. In the end, this rule will neither make dishwashers perform better nor offer quicker cycles.”
Dishwasher water and energy use have declined by more than 50% over the past three decades, thanks to federal standards and manufacturer innovations. Congress set the first energy efficiency standard for dishwashers in 1987; Congress has updated it once and the Department of Energy has updated it twice since then, most recently in 2012.
Cleaning performance has improved in the same period. Product reviewers at Consumer Reports said in 2018 that “[n]ew models clean better and more quietly” and “already do such a good job at cleaning that new features don’t often change our test results much.” The product review website Wirecutter recently found that dishwashers sold today are “better than before” and that poor performance is usually due to improper use.
Under the existing rules, short cycles today may use more energy or water than the cycle recommended for normal loads. The new product class could encourage new dishwashers with short “normal” cycles that use far higher amounts of energy and water but don’t make dishes any cleaner.
“They’re declaring a fix to a problem that never existed,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “And while the Department has been wasting time and taxpayer money making pointless and illegal rule changes, it’s been flouting the law by missing one legal deadline after another for reviewing and updating other efficiency standards. Energy Department officials keep telling Congress that they’re focused on meeting legal deadlines and prioritizing standards that will save the most energy, but this dishwasher rule does neither.”
DOE issued a similar proposal in August that would eliminate existing standards for clothes washers and dryers with a short cycle as the “normal” cycle. Both today’s rule and the proposal for washers and dryers would violate the appliance standards law’s “anti-backsliding” provision prohibiting DOE from weakening standards.

How Can Energy Efficiency Programs Support Building Performance Standards?;"Washington DC, New York City, Washington State, and St. Louis have recently adopted mandatory building performance standards (BPS) that require many existing commercial buildings (and often multifamily buildings) to significantly reduce their energy use. Several additional cities and states are considering similar standards. This is an exciting trend, but it presents challenges for building owners who must comply.
Fortunately, existing energy efficiency programs can help. In a new topic brief published today, we explore how efficiency programs can best support BPS policies and how city and state officials charged with implementing them can work with regulators so that these policies achieve their objectives of significant energy savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
View the Topic Brief
Energy efficiency programs are now active in all of the U.S. jurisdictions that have either enacted or are seriously considering BPS. We interviewed state and local officials working on BPS implementation, utility and other energy efficiency program administrators, other experts, and some state utility regulators about the role of efficiency programs in BPS implementation. We conclude that energy efficiency programs are critical to help jurisdictions implement BPS because they can educate building owners and provide financial and technical assistance. Utilities and other program administrators have the skill set and resources to support successful BPS implementation; we recommend that utilities and cities/states work together to ensure BPS success.
Regulators need to provide efficiency programs with credit toward their energy savings goals for helping building owners comply with BPS
In many states, legislatures or regulators have established energy savings goals that utilities must meet. For efficiency programs to be able to help with BPS implementation, they’ll need to get proper credit for their work from the regulators overseeing them. In the jurisdictions covered by our research, efficiency programs will receive such savings credit prior to the BPS effective dates. We recommend that efficiency program implementors ramp up their programs prior to required compliance dates to help building owners prepare. Budgets should be adequate to meet expected needs, with a focus on affordable housing and other under-resourced properties (affordable housing in particular needs support, as discussed recently by two colleagues). Program implementers and regulators should work to minimize the possibility that sophisticated building owners will exhaust available program budgets and leave other owners (typically those that are smaller and have limited experience with energy efficiency) stranded without assistance.
We also found broad backing for continuing efficiency program support after initial BPS compliance deadlines to assist building owners who have not yet reached compliance and to encourage savings beyond minimum requirements. Full compliance is unlikely until multiple years after the nominal compliance date. Furthermore, depending on noncompliance penalties, noncompliance could be widespread. In these situations, program incentives will save energy and reduce emissions by helping to upgrade buildings that otherwise would have incurred penalties. In addition, we conclude that after BPS take effect, efficiency programs should continue to earn energy savings credits for improving affordable housing relative to current building conditions, as many of these buildings will be unable to meet BPS requirements without such assistance. For other buildings, a modified baseline should be developed that is between current building conditions and presuming buildings will be in full compliance with BPS requirements.
Overall, we find that if efficiency programs are not involved in BPS implementation and not able to credit their efforts toward their energy savings and other goals, then compliance rates, energy savings, and emissions reductions will be lower, and in some cases BPS policies could be rolled back or weakened.
Next steps toward implementation
BPS administrators (cities and states), with help from efficiency programs, will need to do the following:
Bring stakeholders together and develop a common understanding of needs and intents.
Educate building owners about the upcoming requirements and provide technical assistance on how best to bring their buildings into compliance.
Assess workforce needs for BPS implementation and identify shortfalls and ways to address them.
Energy efficiency programs and their regulators, with help from city and state BPS administrators, will need to lead stakeholders in developing an approach to providing ongoing technical and financial assistance to building owners seeking to comply with BPS.
We recommend that utility regulators decide how programs will receive savings credit well in advance of BPS compliance dates so that city and state officials, building owners, and efficiency program administrators can plan their compliance and implementation activities.
Building performance standards can significantly reduce energy use and will be important for achieving long-term energy and climate goals. Energy efficiency programs will be critical for BPS policies to be successful.

Energy Program Evaluation Across The U.S.: Varied Practices, Sound Principles;"Utility energy efficiency programs invested $8 billion nationwide in 2018, so determining their impacts and effectiveness is critical. How much energy was saved? Were program dollars well spent? Did programs meet their goals? How did customers benefit? And how much carbon was kept out of the atmosphere? Asking and answering these questions is the realm of energy program evaluation—practices that are integral to today’s energy efficiency programs and that ensure efficiency’s multiple benefits accrue to customers, utilities, and society.
A new national survey of energy program evaluation policies and practices finds wide variation among states, as earlier studies have also shown. Despite the variation, the survey also found common underlying methodologies and evaluation techniques that have benefitted from industry efforts over the past several years to improve their consistency and quality.

The art and science of energy program evaluation
A fundamental challenge for evaluating energy efficiency programs is estimating the energy savings that result from a given program—that is, quantifying the amount of energy that was not used. There is no such thing as an energy savings meter. Estimating savings typically involves applying statistical, engineering, and modeling techniques to customer energy data and other information. Such techniques have evolved, becoming more advanced through the ability to collect and analyze highly granular customer data. Program evaluators also rely on widely accepted methods, data, and algorithms to estimate savings, increasingly documented and required in technical reference manuals (TRMs), which serve as state guidelines for program evaluation. These practices and advancements have built and strengthened the science of evaluation, but there remains an element of art in program evaluation. The evaluator must know which techniques to apply in different situations given limits, conditions, and available resources.  
Common structures, varying practices
State policies and practices for evaluation are not uniform across the United States. This is not surprising, given the great diversity that exists among states in the structure of their utilities, the policies and regulations that govern them, and the nature of their energy resources. Prior ACEEE research (completed in 2012) found similar diversity in energy program evaluation policies and practices across the states.
Utilities and regulatory commissions rely on evaluation results to guide decisions on energy efficiency and other demand-side programs, such as which programs to offer and how much to spend on them. To make good decisions in the public interest, oversight and administration of program evaluation needs to be structured to ensure accurate and unbiased results.   
In ACEEE’s new update to our earlier research, we found that program evaluation continues to be performed largely by independent contractors. Assigning this role to evaluation professionals helps ensure that results are based on sound methodological practices and that they can be relied upon for good decision making by program administrators and regulators.
Another key issue is evaluation oversight. We found that nearly all regulatory commissions use evaluation results for general oversight of programs and provide opportunities for public involvement. For example, in Massachusetts and Arkansas, the stakeholder collaboratives that advise and review program development, implementation, and evaluation include members of the public.
Shared core principles and new tools to meet new challenges
Our survey confirmed that program evaluation is solidly grounded in a set of core principles. Evaluators today follow well-established professional practices and can draw on a wealth of resources, such as TRMs and the Database of Screening Practices, many of which have been developed in recent years. However, changes in energy markets, technologies, and program goals are affecting program designs and associated evaluation practices. Evaluators face new challenges, such as accounting for carbon reductions or valuing distributed energy resources. To meet these new challenges and improve traditional practices, evaluators can use various advanced technologies, such as smart meters and data analytics. We found that the uptake of such advanced applications is slow. Slightly more than half of the states we surveyed have not yet used advanced metering technologies or data analytics for program evaluation.
Because most utility energy efficiency programs are funded through customer bills, ensuring that the programs are cost effective is a primary function of program evaluation. Several cost-effectiveness tests are used, each representing a different perspective and sets of costs and benefits. As in our 2012 research, we found that the application of cost-effectiveness tests continues to vary widely among states. Despite the variation, there is a growing trend toward embracing core principles that yield balanced and comprehensive assessments of costs and benefits—something some past practices did not do, though it is critical for making prudent choices about investments in utility infrastructure and avoiding wasteful or unnecessary spending.
Energy efficiency is increasingly being called on to deliver multiple benefits to consumers, utilities, and society. In addition to its more traditional focus on reducing costs for customers and utilities, energy efficiency is a fundamental tool for addressing climate change, public health, environmental justice, and energy equity. Evaluation is the way we measure and assess how well our energy programs are meeting these objectives. Our survey shows that evaluation policies and practices are generally well poised to meet current and emerging challenges for assessing the performance and impacts of energy efficiency programs. The critical role of evaluation, however, requires continued oversight and public involvement to ensure accurate and unbiased results that can be used to make wise choices about our energy resources.

Reducing COVID-19 Risks in Commercial Buildings Without Wasting Energy;"Gradually, more offices, schools, and retail stores are reopening, with trends varying from state to state, and often among counties within states. As they reopen, many building owners and managers are considering steps they should take to reduce chances of coronavirus transmission. In this blog post, I summarize what we know and don’t know about the subject and then discuss recommendations based on the best expert guidance we have seen.
As an energy efficiency organization, we want buildings to be safe, and we look for ways to make them safe without wasting energy. Reducing COVID-19 risks is the priority, and research and guidance show that many of the best recommendations to reduce risk can be implemented without excessive increases in energy use.
What we know and don’t know
We know that the coronavirus is much less likely to be spread outdoors than indoors. For example, in a database of more than 1,500 superspreading events, only 3 are indicated as having taken place outdoors (0.002% of the cases) and another 57 (4% of the cases) are cases with both indoor and outdoor elements where it is not clear where infection occurred. The vast majority (more than 95%) of the superspreading events took place indoors.
We know that a primary mechanism for spread of the virus is droplets emitted by infected people, commonly (but not solely) breathed in by people within six feet of an infected person.
We know that the virus can live for a period of time on many surfaces and be picked up when someone touches that surface and then brings their hand to their mouth or nose. This is why people are urged to wash their hands frequently and why there are many recommendations for regularly cleaning surfaces that can become contaminated. However, the emerging consensus is that infection from surfaces is infrequent.
We also know that in some cases, the virus can be carried by air currents farther than six feet. The classic example, noted in this study, is a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where it appears that infected droplets were pushed by a ductless fan coil from an asymptomatic infected diner to two adjoining tables, infecting diners at those two tables. No other people in the restaurant got COVID-19 even though the entire restaurant was poorly ventilated and the infected person was there long enough for any aerosolized particles to likely spread throughout the room.
We know that chances of catching COVID-19 increase as the viral load and period of exposure increase. This is why a Washington State choir practice became a superspreader event – high loads from singing with people in the same room for 2.5 hours.
We know that lack of ventilation can aid spread of the virus (e.g., the Guangzhou restaurant example had ventilation rates approximately one-tenth of the ventilation rates required in California and recommended by the most widely used indoor air quality standards for buildings.) However, there is a debate on how much ventilation is appropriate (more on this later).
We know that some filters can screen out coronavirus cells and UV light can inactivate the virus. There is debate on the degree to which these techniques should be deployed (again, more on this later).
We know that no study has yet documented transmission of coronavirus through building air handling systems. One study found coronavirus RNA in a hospital HVAC system, but the researchers did not test if the viral particles were viable (able to infect people), and they report that “no known transmission events were determined to be associated with these specimens.” This is an area where further research is needed.
What should a commercial building owner or manager do?
Several organizations have explored this topic. Among them is ASHRAE, which has issued a variety of resources. We find particularly helpful guidance from a revised white paper released yesterday by Taylor Engineering, a San Francisco-area mechanical engineering firm. The firm is headed by Steve Taylor, a mechanical engineer who, among his many qualifications, chaired for several years the committee that develops the most widely used indoor air quality standards for buildings. Please note that these are general guidelines, and each building type and individual building is different – your mileage may vary. Building owners and managers should consult with trusted health professionals and mechanical engineers.
In the Taylor Engineering paper, the authors evaluate various mitigation measures using a subjective rating system. This system provides guidance on the most effective and cost-effective mitigation measures. Building owners and managers should start with the 5-star measures, and as resources permit, work down to at least one-star measures—and potentially even lower.
Mitigation measures with five stars:
Require masks be worn at all times indoors in areas where more than one person can gather
Maintain social distancing
Require and pay for employees to be tested regularly
Require symptomatic or diagnosed employees to stay home
Conduct meetings via video, not in person
Work from home as often as possible
Measures with three and four stars:
Implement flexible paid sick leave policies so sick employees can stay home
Reduce office workplace density and install plexiglass guards
Wash hands frequently
Ensure HVAC systems are providing at least Standard 62.1 and code minimum ventilation rates
Disinfect common area and restroom surfaces frequently
Install fever warning system thermal imaging equipment at public entries
Measures with one and two stars:
Convert restroom fixtures, doors, and toilet seats to be automatic and touch free
Install upper room UV-C in public waiting rooms and restrooms (upper room means in the upper part of rooms to minimize occupant exposure; the “C” indicates wavelength band)
Install portable HEPA air cleaner in elevators
Use MERV 13 filters in HVAC system (MERV is a rating on filter effectiveness; MERV 13 is common in new buildings, but many older buildings have less-effective filters and should be upgraded if costs are reasonable)
Disable demand-controlled ventilation and occupied standby (i.e., keep ventilation systems operating during the workday)
Recommission HVAC systems and update control sequences (this measure will make sure the ventilation system is working as designed but is not wasting energy).
The authors suggest a half-star measure with zero cost: disable zonal fans such as ceiling fans where not essential for thermal comfort, as such fans can spread the virus.
The authors also identified several half-star measures that they do not recommend, because they view the costs as greater than the benefits. These include installing portable HEPA filters in workstations, increasing ventilation rates, increasing outdoor air rates, operating ventilation systems 24/7, installing UV-C in air handlers, and adding humidification. They do not recommend HEPA filters in workstations out of concern for worker acceptance and because such filters could provide a false sense of security and reduce mask use. Ventilation is discussed in the next section.
What about ventilation?
In the case of ventilation, low ventilation rates can allow small particles to linger, as in the Guangzhou restaurant. Providing ventilation is very important, but as ventilation rates increase, the incremental benefit declines. Taylor Engineering finds that “current code minimum ventilation rates may be adequate if everyone wears masks” (this is talking about California minimums, which are similar to recommendations in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2016).
Taylor Engineering points out that ventilation does not affect heavy droplet transmission but can affect transmission via smaller particles by diluting viral concentrations. The authors examine a variety of studies related to a standard of reducing viral transmission risk to no more than 1% and conclude that without masks, even a heavily ventilated lab space would not meet the 1% target, but that with masks, a typical variable air volume HVAC system meeting ASHRAE Standard 62.1 would generally meet the target. They also examine the option of operating ventilation systems around the clock (“24/7”) and find that “even at the longest projected aerosol lifetime we found in the literature to date, the virus should be nonviable by the next day” (without 24/7 operation). They conclude that “the benefits with respect to transmission reduction appear to be negligible, while the significant increase in energy use is 100% certain.” For example, we recently heard about a multi-building campus that has increased its fan energy bill by $50,000 per month due to increased air-handling in operations—even as occupancy was at a minimum.
Some health professionals believe that higher ventilation rates should be implemented where possible to further reduce the risk of transmission (see here for example). More research is needed on whether increased ventilation beyond the current ASHRAE standard can significantly reduce coronavirus transmission. For example, it could be useful to study the air in hospital ventilation systems to see if viable coronavirus is present in the air entering rooms via the ventilation system; these systems now serve patients with and without COVID-19 and are worthy of study.
Taylor Engineering sees UV as a potentially useful strategy in high-use areas such as restrooms and public waiting rooms. UV can kill germs that linger in these high-use areas but does nothing to stop person-to-person transmission. For non-high-use applications, Taylor Engineering suggests that UV systems are not recommended as they can be expensive, are often difficult to apply in HVAC systems because of the air volumes and temperatures involved, and can degrade materials such as filters.
Impacts on energy use
Some of the measures discussed above can have a substantial impact on energy use. For example, for a building that normally operates 12 hours per weekday, operating fans 24/7 will more than double fan energy use. Such extra use could be worthwhile if it significantly reduced COVID transmission, but such reductions have not been demonstrated as of this writing.
The same can be said for increased use of outdoor air in ventilation systems beyond the levels suggested in ASHRAE 62.1. Use of MERV-13 filters (where such filters can be retrofitted) does increase the energy use of associated fans (by a few percent compared to MERV-8 filters), because the higher-MERV filters increase pressure losses in the ventilation system. In this case, however, the benefits of filtering out virus and other particles appear to be worth the moderate energy cost. And recommissioning HVAC systems and updating control sequences can often reduce energy use by identifying sources of energy waste, even if some of the needed adjustments increase energy use.
Conclusion
In our view, the Taylor Engineering recommendations represent a fair balance among health, comfort, and energy use. Building owners and managers should implement the most effective measures for their budget. The Taylor Engineering star ratings provide guidance, but as we get to the half-star measures, there is still debate and hence the need for more research. While we continue to learn more about the coronavirus, we do know that building owners can take steps to reduce transmission risks without significant increases in energy use.

Don’t Forget Natural Gas Energy Efficiency;"Yes, natural gas utility energy efficiency programs still make sense. While much of the buzz in the utility industry the past few years has focused on electricity, the data show that gas efficiency still delivers dependable positive results. Although the low natural gas market prices of the past few years create challenges, our new report documents how utilities in leading states across the nation are continuing to provide cost-effective natural gas energy efficiency programs.
Read the New Report
Gas utility energy efficiency programs have a long and productive history. In fact, the first utility energy efficiency programs in the nation were focused on natural gas, in response to the 1973 energy crisis. Since then, gas efficiency efforts have been heavily influenced by policymaker and regulator concerns about the impact of natural gas costs on customers. As natural gas wholesale market prices have declined considerably over the past decade, questions have arisen over the future of energy efficiency programs in the gas utility sector.
In response, ACEEE assessed the current state and future prospects of energy efficiency efforts by natural gas utilities in the United States. We reviewed pertinent literature, interviewed national experts, and surveyed regulators in 10 states that are leaders in utility natural gas savings. The results of our review provide encouraging news for the future of natural gas utility energy efficiency programs.
The results from several large-scale national studies that we cite in the report, conducted over the past decade, show that portfolios of natural gas energy efficiency programs have delivered savings at a levelized cost of $0.40 per therm or less. The picture appears promising looking ahead as well; we find that numerous natural gas energy efficiency potential studies project substantial future gas savings potential at $0.40 per therm or less. We identify eight such studies in the report, which examined states from multiple regions of the country.
We also show in the report how that “cost of saved energy” would be less than just the average wholesale commodity cost of natural gas delivered to utilities (i.e., the “Citygate” price) during most of the 21st century to date, and thus cost effective without needing to consider any of the additional benefits of those programs. While recognizing that record of success, we acknowledge that the recent environment of very low natural gas market prices presents challenges to the economic viability of energy efficiency programs.
The cost of natural gas supply is obviously a critical factor in assessing the cost effectiveness of gas efficiency programs. In that regard, our report discusses how some experts believe that the extremely low natural gas prices of recent years may not continue in the longer term. For that reason, we recommend that the risk of future gas-price increases be considered in any analysis of cost effectiveness. Nevertheless, in case the recent low gas prices do persist, it is prudent to develop policies and approaches that are sustainable under those market conditions.
Planning in a low natural gas price environment requires extra care in designing programs and developing the framework for assessing cost effectiveness. This report offers examples and recommendations that others have proposed toward those ends. Ideas for optimizing programs include partnerships and cost sharing with water and/or electric utilities, increasing incentives to participants when cost effective, and marketing and appropriately valuing non-energy benefits. With regard to assessing cost effectiveness, it is critical that an appropriate cost-effectiveness framework be established. We provide good examples from several states and recommend key features such as the following:
Apply cost-effectiveness requirements at the portfolio level
Use a low-risk or societal discount rate
Appropriately value all system benefits and costs (e.g., include peak demand savings and avoided transportation and distribution costs) 
Provide for special treatment of low-income programs (e.g., exemption from passing the B/C test)
Include appropriate non-energy benefits (e.g., water, comfort, safety, operations, maintenance savings)
Appropriately value environmental impacts (including carbon dioxide)
Incorporate some assessment of the risk of future natural gas price increases
States that have appropriately included these factors are finding that their natural gas utility energy efficiency programs are easily cost effective.
Some environmentalists have raised concerns that continuing gas efficiency programs could perpetuate the use of natural gas for heating and other end uses, whereas climate concerns suggest a need to ultimately end fossil fuel use and switch to electricity provided by renewable sources. We believe that for at least the near term, gas energy efficiency is still beneficial for both the economy and the environment, and we point to examples of states like Massachusetts and New York that are aggressively pursuing both natural gas energy efficiency and beneficial electrification. Going forward, building shell improvements in existing buildings will be particularly important to reduce costs and emissions, regardless of the fuel source.
In summary, as we approach another heating season, we find good reasons for states to continue to pursue natural gas energy efficiency programs. This year, it may be particularly important to target extra efforts toward populations hit hard by the COVID-19 recession.

Celebrate Energy Efficiency Day With ACEEE and 700-plus Groups;"Today is Energy Efficiency Day! We hope you join us in celebrating the benefits of reducing energy waste during this fifth annual public awareness event. Energy efficiency can get the United States halfway to our climate goals by cutting emissions in half by 2050. Efficiency reduces utility bills and can reduce energy burdens. It has created more than 2.4 million jobs, cuts harmful pollution, and contributes to healthier, more comfortable homes.
With the country in a recession and the pandemic affecting millions of people and businesses, energy efficiency can provide solutions to rebuild the economy and get people back to work.
More than 700 local governments, universities, organizations, corporations, and utilities—and 8,000+ individuals—are participating in #EEDay2020 today. Also, more than 25 cities, counties, and states as well as the U.S. Senate have issued official proclamations recognizing October 7, 2020 as Energy Efficiency Day, including Colorado, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Washington, D.C., Indianapolis, and Fairfax County, Virginia.
ACEEE and a network of environmental and energy organizations working to promote efficiency at the regional and national levels welcome your participation in Energy Efficiency Day. While the 2020 City Clean Energy Scorecard shows what many large cities are doing to save energy, we can all take action. Start with simple steps such as sealing gaps around your windows and doors or replacing incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. We offer a slew of home improvement suggestions and other consumer tips on SmarterHouse.org.
The message of Energy Efficiency Day is simple: Energy efficiency can save money, cut pollution, and create jobs. It’s the least expensive, fastest way to reduce harmful emissions while meeting our energy needs.

Scorecard: Leading U.S. Cities Grow Clean Energy Efforts but Many More Lag Far Behind;"Washington, DC—Leading U.S. cities are expanding their clean energy efforts to tackle climate change, yet many more lag far behind, and only one-fifth have community-wide greenhouse gas reductions goals and are on track to meet them, according to the 2020 City Clean Energy Scorecard released Tuesday. New York City leaped to first place in the ranking—spurred in part by a new law ensuring upgrades to many inefficient buildings—followed by Boston and Seattle (tied for second place) and Minneapolis and San Francisco (tied for fourth place).
View the 2020 City Clean Energy Scorecard
The scorecard from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) analyzes the efforts of 100 major U.S. cities—home to 19% of the nation’s population—to make buildings and transportation more energy efficient and scale up the use of renewable energy. It provides the most comprehensive national measuring stick for climate progress and a roadmap for future improvements. Over time, the Scorecard has adopted metrics to assess community involvement and equity as part of cities’ clean energy efforts.
The report, expanded from 75 cities last year, finds that 20 cities are now on track to meet their own community-wide greenhouse gas emission reduction goals—9 more than a year ago. Yet the remainder of the cities are not on track, haven’t provided adequate data, or have not set a goal.
  “Many cities are really seizing the moment and embracing policies that help them fight climate change, while too many others are, frankly, doing very little,” said David Ribeiro, director of ACEEE’s local policy program and the lead report author. “We want to show all the cities, even the leaders, the further steps they can take to cut carbon emissions most effectively and equitably.”
Among the report’s findings:
Washington, DC; Denver; Los Angeles; San José; and Oakland rounded out the top 10 highest-ranked cities, with San José and Oakland making the top 10 for the first time.
The top 10 cities embraced new actions. Boston and Los Angeles updated codes to require new buildings be pre-wired for electric vehicle charging stations at more parking spaces, and San Francisco convened a network to work with marginalized communities to establish equitable zero-emissions residential building strategies.
St. Paul (#16) was the most-improved city, taking key steps to improve efficiency of existing buildings, reduce total vehicle miles traveled, and embrace renewable energy. St. Louis (#28) was the second-most-improved city; in April, it became the third city in the country to require large existing buildings to meet a performance standard, which will drive energy efficiency upgrades.
More cities are making efforts to increase community engagement with, and clean energy investments in, low-income communities and communities of color. Washington, DC, formed an equity advisory group to develop recommendations to be incorporated in its clean energy plans. But nearly all cities have substantial room to ramp up their efforts.
Bottom-scoring cities’ policy efforts have either stagnated or not started; these cities are years behind the leaders. To scale up climate efforts across the country, more cities will need to adopt and implement effective clean energy policies.
Many cities are encouraging electric utilities and state regulators to increase the use of renewable energy in the power system. Twenty-four cities submitted comments on public utility commission proceedings, entered into utility partnerships, enacted community choice aggregation programs, or participated in planning efforts with utilities.
The report assesses policies adopted by May 1, 2020. The public health and economic devastation wrought by COVID-19, as well as the growing outrage over racial disparities and their impacts on communities of color, could cause city policy priorities to change. The report argues that as cities focus on economic recovery in the context of COVID-19, energy efficiency and renewable energy remain a crucial strategy for creating jobs and keeping investment within local communities. Furthermore, a closer focus on equitable planning and investment can yield benefits that have historically been unavailable to communities of color.
“City budgets are under enormous strain. Clean energy policies are part of the solution because they create jobs while reducing energy costs for households, businesses, and city government,” said Ribeiro. “By keeping up and expanding clean energy efforts, cities can support the economic recovery while combatting the climate crisis.”
Mark Chambers, director of sustainability for the City of New York, said: ""This recognition is meaningful for our city, and a result of determined efforts by dedicated government and community leaders. There is still urgent action needed from New York, and all cities, if we are to truly confront the climate emergency.""
Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said: “City leadership on building energy efficiency and overall climate action is more important than ever. While the federal government has used its leverage to prop up polluting energy sectors, cities are stepping up with innovative and bold policies and programs—like our ban on heating oil—that are helping us transition away from dirty energy. Fossil fuels are damaging the health of our residents and our economy and I’m inspired by the all work happening in cities across the nation focused on reducing their use.”   
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said: “Clean energy is a critical part of responding to our ongoing climate crisis. We appreciate ACEEE’s important work, and its support of our efforts to build a more equitable, clean energy future in St. Paul.”
The scorecard ranks cities in five policy areas: 
Local government operations. Austin and Boston tied for the first spot. Each is on track to achieve its greenhouse gas mitigation goals for government operations and has policies to increase energy efficiency in purchasing decisions, construction practices, and asset management. Portland, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, tied for second.
Community-wide initiatives. Washington, DC, was the leading city, adopting several greenhouse gas mitigation and clean energy goals informed by the community. Denver, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis tied for second.
Buildings policies. New York earned the most points and was the only city to receive all possible points for city policies encouraging or requiring efficiency improvements in existing buildings. Seattle, Boston, and Chicago were the next-highest scorers.
Energy and water utilities. Boston, Chula Vista (California), Minneapolis, and San Diego tied for the highest score. These cities and the utilities serving them scored well across metrics for efforts to help customers improve energy and water efficiency, as well as the utilities’ efforts to embrace renewable energy.
Transportation policies. San Francisco took the top spot, earning points for efforts to increase compact, mixed-use communities, particularly near transit hubs, to reduce vehicle miles traveled. Washington, DC, New York, Portland, and Seattle followed closely behind.
The scorecard is based on data collected from cities, utilities, and numerous publicly available sources. Government staff members from all 100 cities were given the opportunity to comment on a draft of the findings.

Stay Tuned: 2020 City Scorecard Identifies Clean Energy Leaders;"Since we last evaluated cities’ efforts to improve energy efficiency, ramp up renewable energy, and integrate equity into their activities, a lot has changed. Our 2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard assessed cities on their work through March 2019, but we’ve since seen more announcements from cities about how they’re addressing climate change – from building efficiency policies to plans for electric vehicles and more. Those developments are sure to have an effect on our upcoming rankings. Here’s a sampling:
Detroit released its first Sustainable Action Agenda. In doing so, it set goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, ramp up energy savings and renewable energy use, and mitigate urban heat islands.
Los Angeles developed and released its Green New Deal, which includes goals to reduce vehicle-miles-traveled per capita and to increase efficient modes of transport like walking and biking.
The Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors paved the way for the City-County Task Force on Climate and Economic Equity. The Task Force is making recommendations on how to meet the city’s emissions reductions goals and mitigate racial and income inequity.
The Philadelphia City Council passed an ordinance making sure large nonresidential buildings are high performing, and requiring tune-ups if they aren’t.
Providence and its Racial and Environmental Justice Committee—composed mostly of community members—released a Climate Justice Plan with climate equity objectives and more than 50 strategies to create an equitable, low-carbon city.
St. Louis’s Board of Aldermen adopted a building performance standard to tackle energy use in large existing buildings.  
Other cities have also taken steps on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and environmental justice. But how does it all stack up? Which cities are showing the most ambition, and which are taking steps to center equity in their work? Three years after mayors from around the country banded together to say they were ""still in"" for the Paris Climate Agreement, who is doing the best and who has climbed—or fallen—in our rankings since last year?
Our 2020 scorecard, set for publication on October 6, has the answers. You can register now for our webinar, at 11:00 am ET that morning where we’ll present the results. Stay tuned.

Zero-Energy Buildings Are Focus of Growing Number of Energy Efficiency Programs;"As building energy codes become more stringent and interest in decarbonization increases, a growing number of energy efficiency programs are focusing on encouraging and assisting buildings that are zero-energy and zero-energy-ready. At least 20 such programs for new construction and major renovation have emerged in the United States and British Columbia, many of them recently, according to an ACEEE topic brief released today.
Read the Topic Brief
Together, these programs have an annual budget of about $65 million. They have collectively completed nearly 200 single-family homes, about 900 apartments in multifamily buildings, and 74 commercial buildings (with the commercial space totaling more than two million square feet of floor area). Affordable housing accounts for a significant portion of the multifamily projects. Many additional projects are in process.
What Is a Zero-Energy Building?
Our new topic brief discusses these programs and the push to construct homes and buildings that produce as much energy as they use. Such buildings fall into two categories: A zero-energy building is an energy-efficient building that, over the course of a year, produces an amount of onsite energy (typically from photovoltaic panels) that equals or exceeds the energy it buys from utilities plus the energy losses from generation and transmission. Zero-energy-ready buildings are typically highly efficient—efficient enough to be operated with onsite energy but lacking the solar energy systems needed to make the building truly zero-energy. A few programs promote zero-carbon buildings, which emit no net carbon over the course of a year.
Why Zero-Energy Buildings?
For the United States to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we need to build new homes and buildings to minimize energy use and emissions, which means zero-energy, or near-zero-energy construction. ACEEE’s 2019 Halfway There study found that zero-energy new buildings are a key ingredient in efforts to cut U.S. energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050, with remaining needed emissions reductions coming from no- and low-emissions energy sources. Furthermore, zero-energy buildings generally have a variety of nonenergy benefits relative to standard buildings, such as improved comfort, improved occupant health and productivity, more room for living and working (because less space is needed for heating and cooling systems), and higher occupancy rates and resale value because of the attractiveness of the zero-energy concept to building purchasers and renters.
The Economics of Zero-Energy Homes and Buildings
Zero-energy homes and buildings often cost a little more to build than conventional homes and buildings, but as experience is gained, costs are going down. Some of these costs can be offset by the savings made possible by very low energy use, which avoids the need for gas lines in buildings and allows the use of simple and relatively inexpensive heating and cooling systems. A study by the Massachusetts chapter of the U.S. Green Building Council found that zero-energy designs could typically reduce building energy use by 44–56% and reduce total building costs (mortgage, energy, and other costs discounted over 30 years) by 0.3–9.8%. In its primary scenario, the simple payback period on incremental costs ranged from 6 to 19 years depending on building type.
New-Construction Programs
For many years, utilities and other program administrators have operated programs to improve the efficiency of new homes and buildings. These programs also generally cover major renovations to existing buildings. Typically, these programs use current building energy codes as a base and provide technical assistance and financial incentives for homes and buildings that are significantly “above code.”
Zero-energy programs often build on these frameworks. For example, new-home programs may have more-stringent specifications and higher incentives for zero-energy-ready homes and sometimes also provide incentives for solar systems.
ACEEE’s New Topic Brief
Our new brief, Programs to Promote Zero-Energy New Homes and Buildings, finds that most of the 20 programs we identified and analyzed focus on zero-energy-ready construction, but several have substantial zero-energy components. The programs are in Canada’s British Columbia, Washington, D.C., and 12 U.S. states.
We also find that:
Three program implementers have five or more years of experience with these programs and dominate the project completion counts. Particularly notable are the Energy Trust of Oregon commercial program, NYSERDA multifamily and commercial programs, and Efficiency Vermont programs addressing single-family, multifamily, and commercial buildings as well as modular housing.
Programs report many lessons learned:
Residential programs find that training for builders is important, as are special efforts to target the largest builders.
Commercial programs find that building a community of practitioners is very important, as is intervening early in the design process and using this early intervention to set and follow through on energy design goals.
It is useful to have simple incentive structures that are easy for builders, designers, and developers to understand.
The multiple benefits of zero-energy homes and buildings need to be highlighted.
Zero-energy building programs are an important contributor to efforts to transform new-construction markets and ultimately make zero-energy and zero-carbon buildings common practice.

Is the Workforce Ready for High Performance Buildings? Report Finds Major Skills Gaps;"We know that improving the energy efficiency of the U.S. building stock can reduce building-related carbon emissions by as much as 50%. High performance buildings, which are energy-efficient, durable, resilient, and offer excellent indoor air quality, will be critical for cutting emissions and meeting our climate goals. Yet these buildings also require highly specialized knowledge to optimize performance.
This specialized knowledge is the focus of a new ACEEE report released today. The report — based on an original survey and expert interviews with professionals who work with high performance buildings as owners, managers, and technicians — identifies the precise skills that education and training programs should prioritize to ensure that the workforce can meet current and future demands.
Read the Report
The vast majority of respondents — 92% — said that operations and maintenance (O&M) is the most critical skill area for the buildings workforce of the future. 
 “Operations and maintenance encompasses a lot of different skills,“ says the study’s lead author, Rohini Srivastava, “In addition to the know-how related to operating and maintaining advanced equipment and automated systems, O&M uses cost-benefit analysis to refine efficiency-related decisions. After setting clear goals, operators and managers can optimize a building’s heating, cooling, and ventilation system. And when something goes wrong in a building, skilled O&M technicians can diagnose and correct the problem to prevent system failure.”
Data and analytics are increasingly important parts of nearly everything we use — including buildings. Operating a high performance building will increasingly require knowledge of data acquisition and analysis, performance modeling, and even cybersecurity. Srivastava points out that “building-related professions today are about so much more than hard physical labor — analyzing data, using computers to program controls and model building performance, and operating cutting-edge technology to drastically cut energy use. These skills mean that compared to the past, more people — including women — may be interested in joining the high performance buildings workforce.”
Respondents also cited nontechnical skills as essential to success, particularly critical thinking and problem solving, communication, teamwork, and leadership; these must not be neglected as building education and training programs push to develop technical competencies in their students.
The report includes several case studies of exemplary education and training programs that are preparing the buildings workforce. Connecticut has a network of technical high schools that introduce students as young as ninth grade to a green construction laboratory called the E-house. The program — the first of its kind in the United States — is a collaboration of the state’s technical high school system, electric utilities, and private industry. It uses energy efficiency and renewable energy funds to provide hands-on training and curricula in energy conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy technologies. In E-House labs, students get hands-on experience with technologies like ductless heat pumps, radiant floors, weatherization, rooftop solar, and solar thermal systems. Students practice sealing and insulating measures to make the structures more energy efficient, and they perform tests to study their impacts.
Experts interviewed for the report stressed the need to change the perceptions that the building O&M profession only involves physical work and that entering a trade is less valuable or respected than attending a four-year college or university. These impressions discourage students from joining the field, shrinking the talent pipeline and further contributing to the skills gaps identified in the report. To counter these detrimental attitudes, it’s essential to expand students’ and parents’ understanding of the O&M profession so they can see how O&M is a high-tech, knowledge-based field, one that uses information networks and the latest technology to operate buildings and save energy.
The report also shows how utilities can create upskilling opportunities for the existing workforce. In 2019, NYSERDA began an on-the-job training program in partnership with the New York State Department of Labor. The program offers financial incentives to eligible energy efficiency and clean technology businesses to hire and provide on-the-job training to new employees. It will pay 50% of new employees’ wages if they belong to a priority participant group that includes veterans, Native Americans, individuals with disabilities, low-income individuals, and 18- to 24-year-olds participating in work-preparedness programs.
If the workforce lacks the requisite skills to manage them, high performance buildings, like this one in Silver Spring, Maryland, will not deliver on their promise of saving energy, improving indoor air quality, protecting the climate, and reducing costs, and these preventable problems would threaten their long term viability.

ACEEE Names Two New Members to Executive Team;"Washington, DC—The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) named Nora Wang Esram as senior director for research and Lauren Ross as senior director for policy, bringing two leading energy efficiency experts to the organization’s executive team. The new members succeed Neal Elliott, who has transitioned to be a director emeritus, and Maggie Molina, who has accepted a position at the Environmental Protection Agency.
“Filling Neal and Maggie’s shoes is near impossible, but we couldn’t be happier to have found candidates who are poised to aggressively scale up energy efficiency at a critical time in the climate crisis,” said ACEEE executive director Steven Nadel. “Lauren is a rising star who has embedded an equity focus across our organization’s work while rapidly building our programs. Nora is a veteran energy efficiency leader we’ve learned from year after year and who we are lucky to have joining us.”
Dr. Nora Wang Esram will join ACEEE from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where she is a chief engineer and team lead. In more than a decade at PNNL, she has led numerous multi-disciplinary research teams to create groundbreaking technologies and strategies advancing energy efficiency. She created the first national building energy asset rating and a comprehensive energy audit and modeling tool—adopted by New York and other cities to support their building energy ordinances. She led a project to utilize smart in-home devices to transact energy with the electric grid and created a Healthy Buildings Initiative.
“We’ll never tackle the climate crisis if we don’t step up our energy efficiency efforts aggressively. ACEEE is leading the charge in developing solutions and I’m thrilled to join their team,” said Esram.
Dr. Lauren Ross joined ACEEE in 2014 and has served most recently as the director of its local policy program. She has led research on the intersection of energy efficiency, affordable housing, and local climate action planning. Ross launched ACEEE’s pioneering research on energy burdens. She has expanded the organization’s work on municipal policy and provided new resources to local policymakers, building relationships with officials, utilities, and community groups across the country.
“I’m incredibly excited to take on this elevated role and reinforce ACEEE’s commitment to inclusive clean energy solutions and affordability as we combat climate change,” said Ross.
The new appointments mark a major transition for ACEEE following the leadership of Elliot and Molina.
Dr. R. Neal Elliott joined ACEEE 27 years ago as founding director of the industry program and was most recently senior director for research. He has guided and overseen a wide range of research efforts, with a focus on industrial energy efficiency and decarbonization, combined heat and power, agriculture and rural energy efficiency programs, and state energy policies. He has testified before Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory bodies around the country. As a part-time director emeritus, Elliott will continue to contribute to ACEEE research and policy efforts on industrial decarbonization.
Maggie Molina has served at ACEEE for 15 years, most recently as senior director for policy. She created ACEEE’s seminal State Energy Efficiency Scorecard in 2007, guided the organization’s embrace of electrification, and led efficiency potential studies and stakeholder processes to help states develop new efficiency policies. She is joining the U.S. EPA as branch chief of the State and Local Energy and Environment Program in the Climate Protection and Partnerships Division, where she will lead efforts to provide critical tools, resources, and technical assistance for state and local policymakers.

Get Ready for Energy Efficiency Day;"October 7—just under two weeks away—marks the annual nationwide campaign (#EEDay2020) to recognize and celebrate the multiple benefits of energy efficiency. Energy Efficiency Day puts a spotlight on saving money, cutting pollution, reducing energy waste, and creating jobs. This year, it comes at a time when the economy needs it the most.
With people spending more time at home to slow the spread of COVID-19, residential electricity use is up. A recent ACEEE report highlighted the economic strain on low-income communities, as well as on Black, Hispanic, and Native American households, who pay a much larger share of their income on energy bills than white (non-Hispanic) households. This strains budgets and puts vulnerable populations at heightened risk of utility shutoffs during the pandemic and recession.
We know that energy efficiency measures and technologies—such as attic insulation, ENERGY STAR® products, and smart thermostats—are a cost-effective, clean way to tame utility bills.
Efficiency employs more Americans than any other single energy sector (at least 2.4 million as of January 1) and has steadily expanded in recent years. However, many jobs have been lost due to the pandemic—up to 620,500 according to an analysis published by E2, BW Research Partnership, ACORE, and E4TheFuture. As we push to revive the economy and put millions of people back to work, the efficiency sector offers great job opportunities. Bold efficiency efforts can also slash energy use and emissions 50% by 2050, getting us halfway to U.S. climate goals.
We invite you to let others know about the 5th annual Energy Efficiency Day, organized by a network of environmental and energy organizations, including ACEEE, that promote efficiency at the local, state, and national levels.
Spread the word by emailing your colleagues and friends or posting on social media; here’s a social media toolkit you can use. We encourage you to take small steps in your home such as those suggested in this post: switch your light bulbs to LEDs, replace your HVAC filters, and seal gaps around windows and doors. 
You can also reach out to your local or state government officials and encourage them to sign up as supporters (it’s free) and issue a proclamation; here’s a toolkit for that. In 2019, more than 500 individuals, organizations, companies, utilities, and local governments signed up as official supporters. The U.S. Senate passed Resolution 347 to recognize Energy Efficiency Day, and more than 41 cities, states, counties, and universities across the United States passed proclamations to do the same. Elected officials and corporations including Google Nest and Lockheed Martin expressed support on social media.
Please join us in ensuring this year’s celebration builds on that momentum. Here are some ideas and details for participating:
► Sign up as a supporter. Join more than 680 governments, organizations, corporations, and utilities participating in #EEDay2020.
► Pitch efficiency success stories to local media. Here are some tips on pitching local media, as well as a sample media advisory and press release you can adapt to promote your EE successes.
► Host an online activity. Ask people to share photos portraying why they love efficiency, create poems about our favorite topic (energy efficiency), or develop memes that will be fun to share on social media.
► Host an online event. Bring together your colleagues or your local community to learn more about efficiency, hear from experts, and help your audience do their own checks for energy-wasting areas in their homes and offices. For more ideas, check out this blog post.
► Post on social media and share EE Day resources. Use our social media toolkit to announce your participation and amplify your support for efficiency’s many benefits. We’ve got sample social media posts and graphics here. Our toolkit is also available in Spanish. Don’t forget to follow and tag @ACEEEdc and @EfficiencyDay, and use the #EEDay2020 hashtag.
► Check out our energy savings tips. Visit the campaign’s website or ACEEE’s SmarterHouse.org, which includes tip sheets for consumers and college students. Watch our quick consumers’ guide video below for more ideas.
► Stay tuned for more efficiency news. ACEEE will soon release its 2020 City Clean Energy Scorecard, a ranking of 100 major U.S. cities on their efforts to advance renewable power and energy efficiency.
 We look forward to seeing what you do on Energy Efficiency Day this year!

House-Passed Energy Bill Includes Significant Measures to Improve Efficiency;"Washington, DC—The energy innovation bill passed by the U.S. House Thursday (H.R. 4447) would make key strides to improve energy efficiency, and the efficiency provisions should be included in any final agreement with the Senate, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) said.
“This bill would deliver real progress in making buildings more efficient and helping the industrial sector reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said ACEEE executive director Steven Nadel. “The House recognized that one of the best ways to make our homes and buildings more efficient is to help states, cities, and tribes adopt and implement stronger building codes. If you want to reduce costs for households and businesses while combatting climate change, you have to include robust building energy codes in any final deal.”
Provisions helping jurisdictions voluntarily implement stronger building codes, a key part of the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act (the energy efficiency bill from Senators Portman (R-OH) and Shaheen (D-NH), and from Reps. Welch (D-VT) and McKinley (R-WV)), were included in the bill passed by the House today, and they are in a proposed bipartisan amendment to a major Senate energy bill.
An ACEEE analysis published in February found that the building codes provisions would save households and business almost $40 billion in energy costs (net after investment) over the lifetime of the measures through 2050. The provisions would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1.18 billion metric tons—equivalent to the emissions from 300 coal-fired power plants in one year—the analysis found.
The House-passed bill also includes a key provision to enable states to set energy efficiency standards for appliances and equipment when the Department of Energy (DOE) has failed to meet legal deadlines to do so, as well as provisions to encourage homeowners to invest in energy efficiency upgrades by providing them rebates (HOPE4HOMES).
The bill includes numerous significant provisions to aid the decarbonization of the industrial sector, including authorization to expand DOE’s Industrial Assessment Centers that help small plants use energy more efficiently; a Clean Industrial Technology research, development, and deployment program; and a smart manufacturing program. It would authorize workforce training initiatives. The bill also includes provisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, including encouraging investments in electric vehicle charging equipment and ensuring federally owned vehicles are more efficient.

Trump Administration Moves Closer to Ensuring Many Furnaces, Water Heaters Keep Wasting Gas;"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) moved one step closer today to blocking a future administration from cutting the amount of natural gas wasted by furnaces and water heaters.
Two of the biggest energy needs in most buildings are heating the air and heating the water. According to DOE, they together account for 62% of all energy use in the average home. Many homes and buildings use gas furnaces (or boilers) and water heaters. While upgrading to electric heat pumps is often the best answer for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring that newly installed gas-fired equipment is far more efficient is also critical.
Today, most gas-fired water heaters and about half the gas-fired furnaces and boilers sold allow a significant amount of heat to go up the flue, wasted. Some models, however, capture a portion of that heat and use it, employing what’s known as “condensing” technology. DOE’s action today is aimed to guarantee that the models that needlessly waste that heat remain on the market for years to come.
DOE hasn’t significantly strengthened efficiency standards for home gas furnaces since 1992. Home water heater standards, last updated in 2010, are also among the many overdue for review. When DOE finally updates standards for furnaces and water heaters, to avoid wasted energy and excess climate change emissions, it will be vital that it set the efficiency bar at the levels of models that use condensing technology.
Gas suppliers, however, prefer otherwise. In 2018, the American Gas Association, American Public Gas Association, Natural Gas Supply Association, National Propane Gas Association, and Spire, Inc. formally petitioned the Department, asking it to define condensing and non-condensing equipment as separate categories with separate standards. That would, in effect, make it impossible to subsequently create a standard that requires models to extract heat that would otherwise go up the flue.
In 2019, the Department proposed to essentially follow the petitioners’ request (ASAP, ACEEE and several allies detailed our opposition to the plan in comments last year). Today, DOE published a supplemental proposal refining the idea and even making it slightly worse. It would go beyond the earlier proposal to expand restrictions on future standards by putting intermediate efficiency levels that are short of condensing performance off limits as well, mandating the availability of low-efficiency, atmospherically vented products. DOE is now one step closer to finalizing this rule.
At stake here are big costs for homeowners, businesses, and our climate if the rule prevents or slows a future administration from ensuring that furnaces, water heaters, and boilers are significantly more efficient. Although a new administration could reverse this rule, that will take time.
DOE previously calculated that an efficiency standard for home furnaces based at least in part on condensing technology would save an average household between $500 and $750 over the lifetime of the equipment, when factoring in both the initial purchase and installation prices and the reduced gas bills. And it found that, over 30 years of sales, these more-efficient furnaces would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 275 million metric tons. That’s equivalent to the emissions from 70 coal power plants running for one year.
If you counted all home and commercial furnaces, water heaters, and boilers at stake, the impacts would be even bigger.
Inefficient furnaces, boilers and water heaters should soon be a relic of the past. Today, we’re one step closer to being stuck with gas-wasting models for years or decades to come.

Report: North Carolina Can Boost Economy, Cut Utility Bills and Carbon with Energy Efficiency Efforts;"New and expanded policies to improve the energy efficiency of homes and buildings in North Carolina over the next two decades could restore jobs while saving $5.9 billion in electricity costs—equivalent to $565 for each state resident—according to a report released Wednesday by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
North Carolina faces the prospect of a continued recession amid the public health crisis. Many residents struggle to pay energy bills. Households in the state are behind payment on more than 1.3 million electric, gas, and water utility accounts, according to regulators, putting many at risk of having their service disconnected.
The new report shows how the state’s executive branch, legislature, utilities commission, and utilities can expand efficiency investments and policies to support economic recovery while helping ratepayers and protecting the climate. The measures analyzed in the report could trim the state’s growing electricity needs by nearly one-fifth by 2040.

“When you get people to work weatherizing homes and retrofitting buildings, it saves folks money on energy bills and cuts greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollution,” said Rachel Gold, report co-author and utilities program director at ACEEE. “The choices policymakers make now are going to determine North Carolinians’ energy costs and the air they breathe for decades ahead. The state can build on its energy efficiency progress and move aggressively to bolster the economy and create jobs while safeguarding public health.”
North Carolina has seen increasingly severe weather events such as hurricanes and flooding because of climate change. The state’s Clean Energy Plan, published by the Department of Environmental Quality in 2019, calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the electric power sector by 70% (from 2005 levels) by 2030. The ACEEE report finds that new and expanded energy efficiency efforts can contribute at least 11% of the needed reductions to achieve the state’s goal.
The report finds that a suite of energy efficiency policies and programs, based on stakeholder-driven recommendations, such as those in the North Carolina Energy Efficiency Roadmap and the state’s Clean Energy Plan, would do the following:
Reduce air pollution from power plants that contributes to heart attacks and respiratory illnesses, cumulatively averting $300-700 million in health harms, based on avoided deaths, hospital admissions, and lost work productivity.
Produce $2.30 in benefits to residents and businesses, on average, for every dollar invested.
Reduce electricity costs for households and business by $5.9 billion (net of costs) over the lifetime of efficiency measures instituted through 2040.
These findings underestimate the maximum potential of energy efficiency efforts as they do not estimate the reduced fossil fuel use in more-efficient buildings, nor examine all possible efficiency efforts, including those in the transportation sector.
The report recommends that North Carolina policymakers build on the state’s successful energy efficiency efforts and do the following:
Establish minimum energy savings targets for utility programs that help customers improve efficiency, including a requirement that at least one-fifth of the energy savings benefit low- and moderate-income customers.
Remove barriers to adoption of high-efficiency heat pumps for air and water heating and other uses.
Remove barriers to industrial facilities’ participation in utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs.
Expand efforts for communities traditionally underserved by energy efficiency programs, including rural, low-income, and renter families, and agricultural and small businesses.
Establish commercial property-assessed clean energy (C-PACE), on-bill lending programs, and a statewide nonprofit clean energy fund to support a robust private market for energy efficiency improvements.
Close loopholes in building energy codes, transition to more-ambitious codes in the coming years, and support code compliance.

Report: Low-Income Households, Communities of Color Face High “Energy Burden” Entering Recession;"Washington, DC—Low-income households, as well as Black, Hispanic, and Native American households, pay a much larger share of their income on energy bills, straining budgets and putting them at heightened risk of utility shutoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic and recession, according to a new analysis from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
The report, arriving as some states end moratoriums on utility shutoffs instituted earlier this year, finds that one-fourth of all U.S. households and two-thirds of low-income ones have high energy burdens, meaning they spend more than 6% of their income on utility bills. Two of every five low-income households have severe burdens, spending more than 10% of their income on energy costs.
View Research
In its analysis of energy burdens—the portion of income paid toward energy bills—the report finds stark demographic and regional disparities nationally and in 25 major metropolitan areas. Compared to white (non-Hispanic) households, Black households spend 43% more of their income on energy costs, Hispanic households spend 20% more, and Native American households spend 45% more. Low-income households (those with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level) spend three times more of their income on energy costs than non-low-income households.
“Even before the recession, many people with high energy burdens had to cut back on other necessities like food and medicine to afford utility bills. Now, many of the same communities that were struggling to pay bills before the global pandemic are being hit the hardest by job losses and could be at particular risk for shutoffs ahead,” said Ariel Drehobl, senior research associate at ACEEE and lead author of the report. “From bad insulation to outdated heating or air conditioning equipment, there’s a lot of energy that’s just going to waste in many homes. If we focus on supporting those most in need to make their homes more efficient, those investments can go a long way to reduce their bills.”
Home weatherization can reduce the energy burdens of low-income households by about 25%, the report estimates. Yet too few of these households are receiving such upgrades. In fact, only 17% of households that said they completed an energy efficiency improvement in the previous two years were low-income, according to federal data—even as low-income individuals make up about 30% of the U.S. population.
The study, based on the most recent available federal data, reflects conditions in 2017; energy burdens are almost certainly higher now as millions have lost income. The report looks at household-level income data and modeled energy cost data from the Census Bureau’s American Housing Survey.
Findings include:
Low-income households face disproportionally high energy burdens. Low-income households spent 8.1% of their income on energy costs, on average, compared to 2.3% for non-low-income households.
Older adults also face disproportional burdens. The median energy burden of older adults (65+) is 4.2%, 36% higher than the energy burden for the median household overall, which is 3.1%.
Housing type affects these burdens. Residents of manufactured homes have 71% higher energy burdens than average households. Households in multifamily (5+ unit) buildings have 23% lower burdens than average households, but low-income households in these same buildings have burdens 81% higher than average.
Energy burdens trends are similar across cities. Though energy burden values differ across the 25 cities, the same groups experienced disproportionate energy burdens in each city. All cities have work to do to address high energy burdens for their most affected residents.
Some cities have more highly burdened residents. Six cities have a greater percentage of households with a high energy burden than the national average (25%): Birmingham, Alabama (34%); Detroit (30%); Riverside, California (29%); Rochester, New York (29%); Atlanta (28%); and Philadelphia (26%).
These burdens also vary by region. Residents of the East South Central region (Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee) have the greatest percentage of highly burdened households (38%).
To address high energy burdens through energy efficiency improvements, the report recommends:
Federal lawmakers should increase funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program and for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).
State and local governments should fund and implement energy efficiency and weatherization programs, separately or in conjunction with the federal program.
State public utility commissions should require utility-sponsored programs for home energy efficiency improvements to serve low-income households at specified levels.
Energy efficiency program administrators should seek to integrate home energy efficiency improvements with other health interventions, leveraging health-related funding streams.
Governments, utilities, private lenders, and organizations should seek to enable accessible and fair financing options for efficiency upgrades, such as “on-bill” financing, where upgrades are paid for with energy cost savings.
Energy efficiency program implementers should conduct collaborative and effective community engagement to create programs that fit the needs of specific communities and target highly burdened households.

Create Jobs and Protect the Climate? Analysis Shows These Investments Would Deliver.;"When Congress returns to Washington this month, it will continue to face not only a health crisis but also an economic crisis, both due to COVID-19. More workers are unemployed than at any time since the Great Depression, with unemployment highest among low-income communities and communities of color.
At the same time, we face a looming climate crisis. And the challenges are interconnected. For example, 360,000 energy efficiency workers—who would normally be helping cut our carbon emissions—are among those still unemployed.
We wanted to see how federal policymakers could most effectively confront the economic and climate crises together using investments in energy efficiency. We modeled 17 different proposed energy efficiency programs and tax incentives Congress could fund—to create jobs quickly while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing energy costs for households and businesses, and cutting air pollution for many years to come. In a white paper released today (building on a preliminary fact sheet we released a few weeks ago), we find that these investments could together achieve:
660,000 added job-years through 2023, and 1.3 million added job-years over the lifetime of the investments and savings
910 million tons of lifetime reduced carbon dioxide emissions
$120 billion in lifetime energy bill savings
Here are some of the highlights and our takeaways.
First, we should get people to work weatherizing homes as soon as it is safe. For decades, the federal government has funded community groups and contractors to weatherize the homes of low-income families, reducing their energy bills by about $300 each year while addressing health and safety problems including asthma. But too many families are stuck on a long waiting list. Boosting funding by $5 billion over five years would add 30,000 years of employment (job-years) through 2023, we found. Additional funding for retrofitting low and moderate-income multifamily housing could add another 70,000 job-years.
Higher-income households could benefit from energy savings too. Rebates for efficiency upgrades in homes (with higher rebates for moderate-income households), paired with support for online training for contractors, could help expand that market while adding 40,000 near-term job-years (this proposal has been dubbed HOPE for HOMES).
Second, Congress can put more people to work by investing in low-carbon, efficient transportation. Public transportation agencies are in financial distress and may struggle to serve riders as demand bounces back. Additional investments in bicycling and pedestrian infrastructure could make walking and biking reliable, safe alternatives during the recovery period. We should spur states to focus on transportation infrastructure projects that have the greatest potential to reduce carbon emissions, which we estimate could quickly add almost 90,000 job-years.
We can also gear up now to more quickly expand use of electric vehicles, which are generally cleaner and less expensive to operate. In addition to extending credits to help more Americans buy electric cars and light trucks and help companies install public charging stations, lawmakers should add a credit to encourage companies to buy new electric freight vehicles. The impacts would balloon in later years as the market grows, with incentives ultimately spurring an added 200,000 job-years (over the lifetime of the investment, not just through 2023).
Third, Congress can support domestic manufacturers, who have taken a big hit from shutdowns, sudden demand shifts, and broken supply chains. Many of these manufacturers have big energy costs. We should invest $500 million to send experts into the 1,500 largest manufacturing plants in the country to identify efficiency upgrades that will help these companies reduce their costs and their greenhouse gas emissions and better compete in international markets. We should also help these plants and others hire energy managers to reduce their energy costs over time. Another $500 million could leverage $5 billion in loans to help smaller plants implement efficiency measures. Combined, these investments would help save industry an estimated $13 billion in energy costs (present value) and provide $28 billion in other benefits to manufacturing plants.
Other important proposals would help small businesses, commercial buildings, new homes, domestic supply chains, and state and local governments, among others, become more efficient. With strategic investments in reducing energy waste, we can put more people back to work now—nearly 700,000 job-years through 2023—and for years to come.
We can help families and companies save more than $100 billion over the coming decades, especially in low-income communities. And we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time by more than 900 million tons (as much as 200 million cars and light trucks emit in a year), while developing building retrofit, electric vehicle, and industrial decarbonization infrastructure that is crucial for addressing climate change while spurring long-term economic growth. It’s time for Congress to help all of us get to work.

With The Shift Toward Electrification, Decoupling Remains Key For Driving Decarbonization;"States across the United States are increasingly prioritizing electrification of transportation and buildings to meet their decarbonization goals. Utilities are an important driver of this investment, so it’s critical that their business incentives be aligned with the public policy goals of an affordable, reliable, decarbonized and efficient energy system.
To keep costs down for electric customers and avoid inefficient utility spending, we need to remove utilities’ incentive – embedded in traditional cost of service regulation – to increase sales and deemphasize energy efficiency investments. Decoupling, which does just that, will be more crucial than ever in an era of electrification to ensure that we grow utility investment in the clean energy economy in a smart, efficient way. Having decoupling in place while pursuing beneficial electrification can help keep costs of electrification down, make decarbonization goals more achievable, and secure the benefits of electrification for customers. Utility regulators in states across the country should preserve, adopt or update decoupling policies as needed to meet decarbonization goals that require beneficial electrification alongside energy efficiency.
Why decoupling?
Under traditional regulation, utility revenues are largely based on sales – the more they sell, the more they earn. Energy efficiency decreases sales and thus revenues, so utilities are effectively disincentivized to pursue it. Decoupling makes utilities indifferent to sales by providing them with revenues at the level approved by the regulator, regardless of how much they sell. 
Decoupling works by periodically (monthly, quarterly or annually, for example) comparing the commission-authorized revenue and the actual revenue. Customers see a surcharge when sales are lower than expected, and a refund when sales are higher than expected. Because ratepayers see refunds when increased sales result in revenues that are greater than authorized, they have a built-in protection against overpaying. Typically, without this mechanism, a utility could over-recover for years without consumers having a mechanism to review or challenge this. Decoupling supports the expansion of energy efficiency by removing the disincentive to invest in these resources, contributing to lower rates over the long term.
From a utility’s perspective, decoupling reduces risk for its shareholders by enabling more accurate cash flow projections and avoiding earnings volatility. That risk isn’t necessarily shifted to customers. Reduced risk can enable a shift toward lower-cost debt and away from higher-cost equity, resulting in customer savings. Eighteen states have recognized these benefits and adopted decoupling for electric utilities, and 26 states have done so for gas utilities.
Is decoupling still needed?
Decoupling removes the motivation to increase sales, and beneficial electrification results in increased electricity sales. This relationship raises the question: As the grid gets cleaner and we want to encourage the electrification that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, should we re-link utility revenues to the total volume of electricity sold?
We don’t think so, and we see four reasons why keeping decoupling – and adopting it where it isn’t yet policy – supports decarbonization, including both energy efficiency and electrification.
First, decoupling can help keep a utility’s spending in check while it pursues electrification. Absent a decoupling mechanism, utilities have incentives to increase sales, regardless of whether that growth comes from efficient and beneficial forms of electrification. Without decoupling, utilities may pursue inefficient electrification, for example by promoting electric resistance heating, or downplaying the importance of weatherization and building envelope improvements. 
Second, decoupling can help make state carbon goals more achievable. Multiple studies have shown that meeting aggressive carbon goals by mid-century will require both energy efficiency and smart electrification – evidence that these approaches are not in conflict with one another. Decoupling ensures that utilities are not disincentivized to pursue efficiency (though required energy savings targets set in policy are also needed). 
Third, decoupling helps ensure that customers benefit from the extra revenue utilities receive from electrification. Without decoupling, the additional revenue utilities earn through electrification won’t materialize as customer benefits until the next rate case. In states without required or automatic rate cases, shareholders may capture an outsized share of that benefit. And getting decoupling in place now can help secure the benefits of electrification for future ratepayers. The transition to electrified transportation, space heating and water heating will take many years to fully materialize. As it does, decoupling has the potential to provide benefit to ratepayers as utilities generate more revenues – but then must refund the excess revenues to their customers, as required under a decoupling mechanism. 
Finally, it is important to note that “decoupling” is not a one-size-fits-all policy and the design of decoupling mechanisms matters a great deal in determining their success. For example, commercial and industrial customers with decoupling during the COVID-19 pandemic might face surcharges when usage unexpectedly goes down during social distancing. On the other hand, with increases in residential usage, residential customers may receive bill credits. Important design choices include whether and how allowed revenues are adjusted over time, which customer classes are included in decoupling, and the allowed size of surcharges or credits. Fortunately, decoupling is customizable, and it can be designed to protect customers and meet state environmental goals.
Beyond decoupling
While it’s critical to maintain and refine revenue decoupling policies, that won’t be sufficient to deliver the transportation and building decarbonization needed to meet state climate goals. Even with decoupling, utilities will inherently prefer actions that increase sales and “grow the company” (i.e., electrification), rather than actions that decrease sales (i.e., energy efficiency). Shifting toward performance-based regulation, which rewards utilities for outcomes instead of further capital investment, can go beyond just removing the disincentive to invest and can align utilities’ earnings opportunities with decarbonization.
State policymakers should consider requirements to pursue beneficial electrification opportunities aggressively (e.g., by evolving Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS) to value energy savings regardless of fuel or by setting technology-specific goals as in Maine and New York). At a minimum, states should update their fuel switching rules and set cost-effectiveness criteria that enable beneficial electrification in ratepayer-funded programs.  
One final issue is the disruption in utility sales caused by the impacts of COVID-19 and the question of whether decoupling is the right mechanism to address associated utility revenue shortfalls. Decoupling is smart for the long term as we move towards electrification, which will take many years, while COVID-19 revenue impacts are hopefully short-lived. State policymakers should work to address long-term objectives, even while temporarily adjusting as necessary to meet the immediate concerns.
In summary, while it may seem that revenue decoupling conflicts with state goals to electrify buildings and transportation, these approaches actually work together for better outcomes. Having decoupling in place while pursuing beneficial electrification can reduce the costs of electrification, support decarbonization, and ensure electrification benefits customers. We encourage regulators to consider how decoupling fits with other policy and regulatory approaches that can align to better help them achieve their goals.

What Do Zero Energy Schools Really Cost? Summer Study Author Explains;"Across the United States, an increasing number of schools generate as much energy each year as they use, and upcoming research shows that such “zero energy” schools can reduce costs and be built on a conventional budget.
These schools are the topic of a paper to be released next week at the virtual Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, which begins Monday. Only registered attendees will have access to this research, along with more than 400 other Summer Study papers on a range of energy-saving technologies, programs, policies, and behaviors.

“When you talk about zero energy buildings, including schools, the immediate response is that I cannot afford that or it is too expensive,” says Paul Torcellini, principal engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Yet, he finds otherwise in a Summer Study paper co-authored with Nathanial Allen at the U.S. Department of Energy and Maureen McIntyre of McIntyre Communications.
They analyzed 88 schools across the United States that are zero energy (ZE) or zero energy ready (ZER). They found that investing in these primary and secondary schools — now the largest category of ZE buildings in the United States — pays off. To learn more, we asked Torcellini to discuss the findings of their Summer Study paper, “Plowing Through the Cost Barrier: Zero Energy K-12 Schools for Less.”
Here are excerpts of our conversation:
What did you learn about the costs and viability of these very energy-efficient schools?
We found that not only can ZE schools be designed and built on conventional school budgets, they can cost less. In an integrated design and construction process, the cost of ZE measures can be offset by, for example, downsizing heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems, reducing both life cycle costs and first costs.
Just the fact that we found almost 90 schools that have good to great EUIs (energy use intensities) is impressive. The analysis shows almost no correlation to cost, but a huge amount of scatter. What does that say? That some schools are very inexpensive and can hit the ZE/R target. Some of the most expensive schools also had large EUIs. 
The target EUIs for zero energy ready schools are in the low 20s (kBtu/ft2). This is about 42% better than new schools built to ASHRAE Std. 90.1-2016, which few jurisdictions have adopted as the energy code. What is important is that there are several schools operating in the high teens for an EUI and several in the low 20s. The message is that it is possible, and our sample set is not an isolated case.
Figure 1. Eighty-eight ZE or ZER schools around the United States, including average energy use intensity (EUI) for each state. (A lower EUI, often calculated as energy per square foot, indicates better efficiency). Source: U.S. Department of Energy
Where in the United States are ZE schools the most common?
Kentucky. It started with a county school board that wanted to minimize long-term costs (which included the capital/bonding). Working with an engineer and architect, they made it work. Those firms have replicated the process and successfully created ZE schools across their portfolio of projects.
How much does a solar photovoltaic (PV) array increase a ZE project's costs?
This is a fascinating story. The cost of PV has plummeted in the past 15 years. Designers are continuing to improve the energy performance of the buildings they design, so this is also going down. Both contribute to a decrease in the cost of PV in absolute dollars and as a percentage of building costs (which are rising). Where we had data that separated out PV costs, this cost was around 3% of the total project. I have heard that cost estimating error is in the 5% range—so we are at a point where the cost of PV is less than the error associated with the design process. The message here is that, even though it is an additional cost, it should always be included in a project as an add-alternate if it is not in the base project. Also, if you don’t have the 3%, which can sort of be considered an extra expense, there are plenty of companies willing to finance that PV through a power purchase agreement or other financial vehicles. The key to making it work, however, is the energy efficiency piece and meeting the ZE/R energy targets.
How can school districts best control ZE construction costs?
Put the energy goal in the specifications upfront. Establish a reasonable price for the school project. Hire a design team that is committed to meeting the goal with the budget that is available. I hear from design teams all the time that they are willing to make the school ZE/R, but the owner needs to ask. The designer can make this happen. 
Given COVID-related economic challenges, is now the time to build ZE schools?
There are two questions here. Are school districts going to build schools? If so, there is no reason not to make them ZE/R. In many ways, the design concepts that we are seeing in ZE/R schools are often consistent with COVID-19 related issues. Separate space conditioning from ventilation air. Provide ventilation air to each zone at a low velocity and exhaust air directly from that zone. I think that design teams, given a list of constraints, can make both happen.
What can students learn from ZE schools?
That building science is cool—or whatever the current phrase is today in school. As many of these schools are considered new and intriguing, they gain public attention. Students have been known to lead tours for professional groups through the building. They are using the data for science and math projects. They are gaining communication and writing skills and will take responsibility for the energy use of their building. Effective curriculum development and energy dashboards help facilitate this process.
What’s next?
As more schools get built with low EUIs, the story will get stronger. We are always looking to hear stories of great energy performing schools and the costs to build them, so feel free to send them along. We hope these examples of early adopters are the catalyst that will change how communities think about energy performance of their schools.

New U.S. Rule Would Allow Unlimited Energy Waste from Washers and Dryers;"Washington, DC — The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) on Wednesday announced a proposal that would allow new clothes washers and dryers that waste unlimited amounts of energy and water, raising home utility bills and carbon emissions.
(The DOE also announced a proposal Wednesday to approve new showerheads that use enormous amounts of water and energy—see blog post in response.)
The current efficiency standards for washing machines, which were set in 2012, save a typical consumer $365 over the life of an appliance, when factoring both utility bills and purchase costs. Federal law prohibits DOE from weakening efficiency standards, but the new proposed rule would attempt to dodge that prohibition by creating a separate “product class” specifically for machines that have a short cycle as their “normal” cycle. Such machines would have no energy efficiency or water use standard, at least until one was developed, which generally takes years. Most new washing machines already have a short cycle as an option.
“They’re trying to get around the law. There’s no other way to interpret it,” said American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) executive director Steven Nadel. “If they move ahead with this, they’re likely to get challenged on the legality of it. If this plan made it through the courts, consumers could unwittingly get stuck with appliances that waste energy and water, driving up their bills.”
The first energy and water efficiency standards for washers and dryers were set by Congress in 1987 during the Reagan administration. Thanks to a series of strengthened standards, washing machines now use, on average, about 75% less energy than they did before the first standard, according to industry data, even while many handle bigger loads. In the meantime, product prices have decreased while performance has improved. Consumer Reports had to make its washing performance tests harder over the years to keep up with improving technology and to better differentiate products.
“For three decades, washers and dryers have gotten more and more efficient while performing better. We shouldn’t go back to models that waste huge amounts of energy and water but don’t get clothes any cleaner,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP). “DOE appears more interested in notching up another senseless regulatory rollback than in saving energy and helping consumers reduce their utility bills.”
Last year, DOE proposed a similar “short-cycle” rule to roll back dishwasher standards. DOE also eliminated light bulb standards and has proposed a policy to head off future standards for furnaces and other gas appliances.

Trump’s Showerhead Plan Is Here, but Many Models Already Deliver a Dense Soak;"In the midst of a pandemic, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) followed up today on President Trump’s January pledge to get “rid of the restrictors” on showerheads, part of his repeated false complaint that toilets, faucets, and other household fixtures have been ruined by federal efficiency standards. DOE proposed a rule to approve new showerheads that waste enormous amounts of water and energy, which would increase utility bills and greenhouse gas emissions.
(The DOE also announced a proposal today that would allow new clothes washers and dryers that waste unlimited amounts of energy and water—see ACEEE/ASAP statement in response.)
The showerhead proposal comes just months after a study published in the journal Science, as reported by the Washington Post, found that a “vast region of the western United States, extending from California, Arizona and New Mexico north to Oregon and Idaho, is in the grips of the first climate change-induced megadrought.”
The new plan is a gimmick in search of a problem. Complaints about inadequate showerheads were frequent decades ago, immortalized in a 1996 “Seinfeld” episode. But for many years now, we’ve had a fix for poorly performing models, one that requires no action by the Trump administration.
“Tired of a shower that produces more of a weak sprinkle than an invigorating stream?” Consumer Reports asked readers in 2009. “Change your showerhead.” In the wake of years of innovation, including the improved use of aeration, the magazine found that “the top water-saving and rain-shower models we tested provide a strong flow.”
Today, about three-quarters of the showerhead models for sale use at least 20% less water than the maximum allowed, by ASAP’s count of a federal database. And while there are always going to be some sub-par models, the top-rated one on the product review website Wirecutter (which testers said delivers a “powerful, dense soak that envelops your entire body”) uses only 70% of the water permitted by federal rules.
So, what is DOE trying to do here?
Proposal seeks to subvert 1992 law signed by George H.W. Bush
Many manufacturers were already making lower-flow, 2.5 gallon-per-minute showerheads by the early 1990s, in part responding to severe droughts in the late 1980s that strained water supplies in several regions.
Congress put a 2.5 gallon-per-minute maximum flow rate standard into law as part of a 1992 energy bill, which passed the U.S. House in a 363-60 vote and the U.S. Senate without even a roll call. The showerhead provision went into effect in 1994.
Initially, federal law prohibited states from setting stricter requirements, but this state preemption expired when DOE failed to update the national standards. Six states, comprising about one-fourth of the U.S. population, have their own showerhead standards that save at least 20% compared to the national levels.
The federal law, like others concerning appliance and equipment standards, doesn’t permit DOE to weaken the standard, or “backslide.” So how is it claiming it can do that today?
The trick DOE is floating here is to try to dodge the law by reinterpreting what the word “showerhead” means.
The proposal, if finalized, would allow manufacturers to make giant showerheads with several nozzles within them. DOE proposes to accomplish this through a change in the test procedure that would characterize each of those separate nozzles as a showerhead. The full device could have as many 2.5 gallon-per-minute showerheads as the manufacturer wants. Get it?      
The issue has actually been debated before, primarily in 2010 and 2011. DOE took a more clear-headed reading of the law at the time: “[I]t has always been the Department’s view that when Congress used the term ‘any showerhead’ it actually meant ‘any showerhead’ – and that a showerhead with multiple nozzles constitutes a single showerhead for purposes of [the] water conservation standard.”
DOE’s 2011 guidance showed these examples of model types that would not comply with the 1992 law if the full device used more than 2.5 gallons per minute.
The shower gimmick would raise costs and greenhouse gas emissions
In response to a historic drought, the president apparently wants showerheads that spray water every which way. It’s an absurd use of DOE’s time, and it’s not going to help our water reservoirs.
The existing showerhead standard has spurred manufacturers to make devices that are more satisfying while using less water. That reduces our water bills, and it also reduces our energy use. Utilities require enormous amounts of energy to deliver water. Even more importantly, because showerheads deliver hot water, reducing the water flow through them cuts home water heating needs – which account for about a fifth of the average household’s energy use.
In other words, if the new proposal is finalized and makes it through the courts (DOE will almost certainly be challenged for violating the provision in the law prohibiting backsliding on standards), consumers who use the products will pay the price on their monthly energy and water bills. Ultimately, the plan would raise greenhouse gas emissions when more fuel is burned in homes with gas water heaters and at the power plants that supply power to homes with electric water heaters. 
The new multi-nozzle showerheads would not only needlessly waste water, exacerbating shortages caused by drought, but also boost the carbon pollution that has made long-term droughts worse. No one benefits from this gimmick.

The Energy Efficiency Workforce: Summer Study Author Explores Topic and New DOE Effort;"Energy efficiency has long been an engine for U.S. job growth, directly supporting at least 2.4 million jobs and producing more new ones than any other part of the energy sector. While the COVID-19 pandemic has put many jobs at risk, tech-savvy workers will be needed to build or retrofit increasingly efficient homes and buildings.
Workforce training is one of the pressing topics at this year’s Summer Study for Energy Efficiency in Buildings Virtual, which begins August 17. The energy efficiency workforce, the focus of six Summer Papers research papers and an informal session, will be discussed throughout the conference. Only attendees will have exclusive access to the plenaries, interactive sessions, networking opportunities, and the more than 400 papers on the latest energy-saving technologies, policies, and programs.
Register for the 2020 Summer Study
“The construction and energy efficiency sectors consistently report difficulty finding enough skilled workers to meet their pre-COVID-19 demand,” says Sarah Truitt, a project leader at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). “When businesses cannot find adequate labor with necessary skills, they must delay projects, increase costs, and resist technologies that require specialized knowledge and skillsets to install.”
Next month, ACEEE will release an in-depth report on training the workforce for high-performance commercial buildings. In a Summer Study paper, “Building the Efficiency Workforce,” Truitt takes a broad look at the issue with co-authors Juliana Williams of NREL and Madeline Salzman of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). She discusses a new DOE effort, announced in June, that includes an energy efficiency career map.
Here are excerpts of our conversation:
Which skills will professionals need for advanced, energy-efficient construction that they currently lack?
Overall, better understanding of building science principles – including heat transfer and moisture transport – is necessary for professionals to problem solve in the field, particularly in retrofits. Studies suggest more people need to understand and use Building Information Modeling to improve planning and sizing calculations. I also anticipate more cross-disciplinary training among architecture, engineering, and construction professionals as a need that will continue to grow. Finally, increased knowledge about the benefits of efficient buildings among real estate and financing professionals is key to these buildings being appropriately valued and financed.
Your paper notes demographic gaps in the efficiency workforce. Which are most prominent?
Women and Black Americans are the most underrepresented groups within the energy efficiency sector when you compare their participation to national workforce averages.
  2020 U.S. Energy and Employment Report
Your paper mentions Germany’s worker training. How does it differ from the U.S. approach?
Germany has done a great job of exposing students to careers in the trades. In fact, a majority of Germany’s secondary school graduates move on to post-secondary Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs. Comparatively, CTE programs are not promoted as much in the United States, and many school systems define success in terms of students progressing to four-year degree programs rather than CTE programs. Recent efforts from the federal government to promote CTE programs have included an executive order on expanding apprenticeships in America in 2017 and reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins Act) in 2018.
Can you tell us a bit about DOE's new workforce accelerator and career map?
Yes! The DOE Buildings Technologies Office recently awarded the Interstate Renewable Energy Council with a project to create a career map that describes the range of energy efficiency occupations across industries. The online map will be interactive and will include information about necessary skills and credentials and chart potential pathways for career advancement in different occupation types.
 In June, DOE announced the Better Buildings Workforce Accelerator. The accelerator will convene a group of like-minded organizations working to increase the level of building science and energy efficiency knowledge across all professions related to the building industry. This is a 3-year effort where partners share best practices and lessons learned, have access to DOE and national laboratory experts, and can connect and collaborate. We have our kick-off meeting planned for September, so there is still time to join.
Given COVID-19's impact on the energy efficiency workforce, how important are your efforts now and what do you hope to achieve in the next three years?
COVID-19 is presenting sincere challenges to America’s workforce, families, and industries. We have a big opportunity to focus on education and upskilling – while people are at home and some, unfortunately, are out of work. We hope that when provided with informational resources and access to trainings, people interested in entering the efficiency workforce can expand their skills. The Better Buildings Workforce Accelerator will include a centralized website for this information.

Study: Home Energy Ratings in Real Estate Listings Would Steer Buyers to Efficient Choices;"Washington, DC—A first-of-its-kind empirical study shows that including home energy efficiency scores in online real estate listings would lead buyers to choose more-efficient homes with lower energy costs. The new study provides the clearest evidence to date that state or local policies ensuring that home energy information is presented to buyers would influence their choices, not only meeting their needs but incentivizing sellers to make home efficiency upgrades and builders to construct more-efficient new homes.
Read the Report
Home buyers have said in repeated surveys that the energy efficiency of homes is a priority. Yet sellers rarely include efficiency information in their listings, so potential buyers using the major real estate aggregation websites—where 93% of home buyers begin their searches—generally cannot find this information. Only Portland, Oregon, requires home energy information in real estate listings; a dozen other U.S. cities or states mandate or suggest some type of home energy disclosure at various stages during transactions, often well after prospective buyers have evaluated competing options.
“We always thought home buyers would respond to energy efficiency information, but now we’ve shown it’s really true,” said Reuven Sussman, co-author of the report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) and director of the organization’s Behavior and Human Dimensions Program. “Prospective home buyers have a lot of information at their fingertips, but usually they know little about the energy efficiency of the homes they’re considering. Just getting the right information in front of people can make big differences in their choices. If we can help buyers find efficient homes, we can really stimulate demand for them.”
ACEEE used a panel research firm to recruit a national sample of 1,538 individuals who indicated they were planning to purchase a home within the next five years. Participants viewed a mock real estate website showing three sample homes at a time and were asked to select the home they preferred the most within each set. The listings—including information such as price, bedrooms, and square footage—were part of a “discrete choice experiment” that allowed researchers to determine the weight of participants’ preferences among competing factors.
A sample home listing used in the experiment, showing Home Energy Score along a continuum—found to drive buyer preferences more than in any other presentation form.
Some participants saw information about the homes’ energy efficiency, presented in one of five possible ways: a simple Home Energy Score (HES), based on the U.S. Department of Energy’s rating system; an HES along a continuum (line) from inefficient to efficient; estimated annual home energy costs; estimated annual home energy costs plus HES along a continuum; or a HES for only above-average homes (simulating a voluntary labeling program).
Using the data on participants preferences, ACEEE found the following:
Energy efficiency information encouraged home buyers to avoid the least-efficient homes and choose more-efficient ones. Home buyers with such information clicked on the least-efficient listing less often (23% less), and the most-efficient option more often (14% more), compared to those who did not see this information.
Presenting efficiency information for only the most efficient listings (mirroring a voluntary labeling policy) was not an effective strategy for encouraging choice of efficient homes.
Home buyers valued efficiency most when it was presented as an image depicting the home’s efficiency score along a scale from inefficient to efficient, as shown in the image above.
The report recommends that state and municipal policymakers require efficiency information in all real estate listings and use an intuitive energy scoring system.
The report cautions that low-income home sellers could be adversely affected by energy efficiency disclosure requirements unless they are accompanied by complementary policies, given that homes owned by low-income households tend to be less efficient than those owned by non-low-income households. It calls for policymakers considering disclosure requirements to research and develop such complementary policies to help home sellers, especially low-income sellers, increase the efficiency of their homes.

How Far Are India and China Going to Slash Energy Use? Summer Study Author Explains;"Two countries — India and China — account for slightly more than one-third of the world’s population, and they (along with the United States) are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Their energy-saving efforts will be critical in the fight against climate change.
This topic is the focus of a paper submitted for the Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, which begins August 17. The biennial event will feature more than 400 papers on energy-saving technologies, policies, and programs all over the world. Only registered attendees will have access to this research, as well as the plenaries, interactives sessions, and networking opportunities.

“Both countries have been taking significant actions to improve the energy efficiency of their economies,” says Philip Mihlmester, executive vice president of global energy at ICF, a Virginia-based consulting and technology services company. He says India and China have signed the Paris Agreement and are making a “good start” toward their 2030 goals. Compared to 2005, India aims to reduce energy intensity 33-35% by 2030 while China seeks a 60-65% cut.
 China ranked 8th and India 15th among 25 countries on ACEEE’s 2018 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard, which indicated that all the countries — even top scorers Germany and Italy — can better use energy efficiency to meet their climate goals.
 While recent non-governmental efforts such as India’s energy efficiency scorecard are encouraging, Mihlmester looks at governmental steps in a Summer Study paper, “India and China: Energy Efficiency Practices and Challenges,” that he co-authored with ICF colleagues Rathin Kukreja and Enrui Zhang. To learn more, we asked him a few questions about their research. Here are excerpts of our conversation:
  Your paper cites barriers to improving energy efficiency in both countries. What are the biggest ones?
A major barrier in both countries is the strong government role in determining energy prices, either through subsidies (India) or direct price controls (China). To the extent energy prices are artificially low, incentives for energy efficiency are reduced. High initial cost, especially for medium and smaller entities, is also a significant barrier.
Why is it so important for India to reduce buildings' energy use and what steps is it taking to do so
Two-thirds of the projected 2030 high rise building stock in India is to be built between 2015 and 2030. Further, by 2037, it is estimated that cooling demand in buildings will increase by 11 times from 2017 levels. This rapid urbanization, and the concomitant expansion of cooling loads, makes the buildings sector an important target for energy efficiency. New construction building codes are the primary strategy India is employing to make new buildings as energy efficient as feasible.
The industrial sector dominates India's energy use. How is the government trying to reduce it?
For large industries, the government has initiated a Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme. Industry sectors have energy efficiency targets. Those that overachieve can sell credits (ESCerts) to companies that are having difficulty meeting their targets. Medium and small industrial entities are being assisted by government programs offered through a state-owned ESCO, and a program run by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency is demonstrating energy efficiency technologies and practices at the medium and small industry “cluster” level.
Your paper says that China's strategy emphasizes cutting industrial energy use. How is it doing that?
China’s centrally planned economy has excess capacity in several industrial sectors and is actively planning to reduce investment in those sectors, thus reducing their energy consumption. For the remaining industrial sectors, China is retiring plants with older, outdated equipment and has published an Industrial Green Development Plan to make remaining plants more efficient through updated equipment and better management approaches. China’s industrial energy intensity has declined by 47% from 2000 to 2018.
What are China's biggest steps to reduce energy use in buildings and transportation?
In the buildings sector, China has focused on enhanced codes and standards for the energy efficiency of new residential and commercial buildings. Like India, China is rapidly urbanizing and has the largest new buildings market in the world. For existing buildings, China is moving away from government subsidies and attempting to privatize existing building upgrades through an ESCO-like model.
In the transport sector, China has increased use of electric vehicles (EVs). It has the fastest country growth rate in EVs. Its market size more than tripled in the past 10 years, and the sales of EVs make up more than 50% of the global total. For non-electric vehicles, China has promulgated enhanced fuel efficiency standards for automobiles and heavy-duty vehicles that kick in over time. China has also developed plans for enhanced efficient public transport networks.

Analysis: Energy Efficiency Investments Could Create 660,000 Jobs and Boost the Economy;"Washington, DC—A package of federal investments in energy efficiency would stimulate the economy and create 660,000 jobs (job-years) through 2023, a new analysis released Tuesday finds. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) study shows that the measures would ultimately create 1.3 million jobs, cut consumer and business energy costs by more than $120 billion, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to those released by nearly 200 million passenger vehicles in a year.
Read the Fact Sheet
Read the White Paper
ACEEE modeled the potential impacts of 17 proposals—many already pending in Congress—that would put people to work improving the energy efficiency of buildings, transportation, and industry. The analysis follows a recent report that 360,000 energy efficiency workers—primarily in construction—are unemployed in the United States.
“We can put people back to work and even create new jobs in the efficiency sector; it’s as simple as that,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of ACEEE. “These proposals would stimulate the economy quickly because they’re largely based on existing programs we know work. They’d generate jobs while reducing home energy costs and making a big cut to greenhouse gas emissions.”
The largest estimated impacts (and investments) come from tax incentives for efficiency improvements to commercial buildings and existing homes and for electric vehicles—policies that have earned bipartisan support in Congress. Other proposals with large impacts include retrofitting apartments and offering homeowners rebates for efficiency upgrades.
Efficiency proposals do more than save energy and create jobs. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) is also critical to lower energy burdens and provide health benefits for those most in need during this crisis. Also, proposed industrial programs would provide large benefits beyond the energy savings.
For each proposal, researchers modeled national energy savings by fuel, monetary and emissions savings, and costs, as well as the resulting net changes in the number of jobs. The projections are based on likely scenarios for implementation, not on maximum potential impacts, and do not include additional benefits from expanding future use of these efficient technologies and practices.

Thin Triple-pane Windows Brighten U.S. Market: Summer Study Author Describes How;"Windows have advanced considerably over the decades — from drafty single-pane models to much better double-pane ones. Now, over just the past two years, thin triple-pane windows that offer a lot more insulation have entered the U.S. market. Such technology enables homes and buildings to save even more energy while being comfortable and bright, with plenty of windows.
The new windows are the topic of one of the more than 400 papers prepared for the Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, beginning August 17. Conference attendees will have exclusive access to the papers, which explore a wide range of energy-saving technologies, policies, and programs for homes and buildings.
Register for 2020 Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings VIRTUAL
“Windows are how we connect to the outdoors,” says Robert Hart, principal scientific engineering associate at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, adding that they have a great impact on energy use and occupant comfort. Yet, he says, windows typically used today are the “poorest thermally performing part” of the building envelope, potentially resulting in drafts, condensation, or overheating.
Hart is part of a Department of Energy-funded team that is working with organizations and manufacturers (including makers of the new thin triple-pane windows — Anderson Corporation, Ply Gem, and Alpen HPP) to develop better windows, scale production, and reduce costs. We talked to Hart about this work and the Summer Study paper, “Innovative Market Pathways to Promote Adoption of High-Performance Windows,” that he co-authored with the team.*
Here are excerpts of our conversation:
Double-pane windows are often the norm. How are triple-paned ones different?
They are more insulating. In fact, the triple glass element with gas fills and low-emissivity (low-E) coatings can be twice as efficient as a double-pane low-E unit. This thermal improvement leads to several benefits. They keep room-side surface temperatures closer to the room air temperature, meaning they significantly reduce the risk of condensation on cold nights and are more comfortable to be next to on both hot and cold days. They also lose less heat to the outdoors, making homes more energy efficient and resilient.
Conventional triples are widely used in Northern Europe but represent less than 2% of the U.S. market. Our “thin triple” design is intended to make it easier and more cost effective for window companies to switch from today’s standard R3 double glazing to R5 triple-glazed windows.
What can you tell us about the thin triple-paned windows that recently entered the U.S. market?
The current offerings range from products designed for new construction production builders to products for high-end retrofits. Due to the current market conditions with COVID-19, they are all making a slow launch, but we are still very excited to see these products finding their way into the market. Two of the companies are represented in the top five of national residential sales, so they have the potential to make a large market impact.
Are these windows more expensive, and will they work in all existing homes and buildings?
Highly insulating windows, such as triple-pane windows, are good candidates to be used in most U.S. climates. The lowest possible cost for triple-pane windows will always be more than the lowest possible cost for double-pane windows, simply because there is more material being used. But we know the material costs at the manufacturer’s plant are low, and we also know that the current cost difference to consumers is much higher than it could be because the designs aren’t optimized and because production volume for triple-pane windows is so low.
We recently had a German window manufacturer visit our lab and she described to us how double-pane units from their factory cost more than triple-pane units because they are set up to make triples in volume, while doubles are considered special order products. This could be in the future for the United States, as well.
What are the biggest obstacles and opportunities for scaling the use of thin triple-pane windows?
The biggest obstacle is cost, which is related to volume, as noted above. The path to successfully gaining high market penetration, and therefore reducing the cost, is to initially identify opportunities where cost is less of an obstruction to adoption. In new construction, there are opportunities where using triple-pane windows as alternative means of code compliance in place of other mandatory envelope measures can actually reduce construction costs. With retrofits, where sales are often made directly to the occupants, the incremental cost of triple-pane is less of an obstacle. If better windows allow HVAC to be downsized, that’s another savings opportunity.
Given the improvement in windows, do new homes or buildings need to reduce the number of them to achieve net-zero energy use?
Not at all! In fact, they could use more windows. They just need to use better technology solutions than the windows typically used today. I have a favorite slide I always like to show in presentations of a home without windows — I haven’t met anyone yet who wants to live in that home! 
High-performance windows used in conjunction with smart building envelope design, such as external shading and passive solar harvesting in cold climates, can allow buildings with large areas of windows to use less total energy than buildings with no windows at all. In commercial buildings, the daylight from windows also offsets electric lighting energy use. We call this concept net-zero or zero-energy windows.

Utility Regulators Can Use Efficiency to Confront the COVID-19 Recession and Climate Crisis;"The United States is facing two simultaneous and unprecedented crises. One is immediate and discussed daily (the COVID-19 pandemic and associated recession), and one has faded from discussion but is nonetheless urgent (climate change). State energy efficiency policies are well-suited tools for addressing both of those crises, and policymakers should be accelerating those efforts.
As a prime example, state energy regulators can help drive an economic recovery—and simultaneously pursue climate goals—by capitalizing on energy efficiency resource standards (EERS). These are state policies that require utility customer energy efficiency programs to achieve specified energy savings. These policies need to be protected and enhanced. Fortunately, public utility commissions in several states are already showing the way forward.
Twenty-seven states have EERS policies. They’re a proven mechanism for cutting household and business energy costs and reducing air pollution from power plants. And they’re a key component of many states’ efforts to achieve aggressive goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change. But state regulators now face the challenge of maintaining these bedrock policies during the pandemic—with jobs and the climate at stake.
Efficiency contractors have been devastated—and some proposals could make the situation worse
Unfortunately, the COVID-19 crisis has not spared the energy efficiency and weatherization contractors who help utilities meet these targets, who are sometimes limited by necessary social distancing measures. According to a recent report, 360,000 U.S. energy efficiency workers—15% of the clean energy sector workforce—are out of their jobs.
Worse yet, parties in some states (e.g., Ohio, New Jersey, Missouri) have advocated changes that would perpetuate that impact, taking funding away from energy efficiency and redirecting it to other areas. Even if well-intentioned, such proposals are short-sighted and ultimately counterproductive. For one, they would delay measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But what is perhaps less understood is that they would also be wrong-headed for purposes of responding to the COVID-19 crisis, because they would exacerbate, not alleviate, the economic crisis. Fortunately, proposals that would take funding away from efficiency have for the most part been rejected. However, they could resurface, and new proposals could arise.
Efficiency mandates are an economic opportunity and a climate imperative
Energy efficiency programs can help states and localities with economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis in three important ways: (1) reducing household and business energy bills, directly helping with affordability challenges; (2) serving as an economic stimulus by generating increased local employment (energy efficiency programs tend to be very labor intensive); and (3) reducing ”dollar drain” from the local economy by reducing the need for imported energy fuels (most states, and nearly all local communities, have to import the fossil fuels they consume from outside of their territory, resulting in a substantial dollar outflow).
While dealing with the COVID crisis is necessarily a central focus for states at this time, a critically important second priority must be to continue aggressive efforts to address the looming climate crisis. In any other time, the report in late June that the temperature in the Arctic Circle reached 100°F would have received much attention as a jarring reminder of the climate crisis we face. Let us hope that our leaders are up to the challenge of continuing to confront that crisis, even as they respond to the COVID-19 emergency. Fortunately, supporting energy efficiency is one of the fastest, most cost-effective tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Regulators can ensure economic and climate progress at the same time
So what are state policymakers and utility regulators to do? To begin, it’s crucial to not abandon well-established energy efficiency policies and goals, including EERS policies. Some utilities, like Xcel in Colorado, are on track to meet 2020 energy savings targets, and even proposed expanded 2021–2022 projected targets. However, others’ targets may need to be adjusted. Medium-term goals (over the next two to three years), however, should be preserved. In fact, if energy efficiency is included as a key part of state economic recovery efforts, medium-term goals might even be increased.
Regulators should review efficiency efforts in light of the COVID-19 crisis, and where possible, ensure that the existing policy infrastructure for energy efficiency, including EERS goals, can serve as a tool for economic recovery. A couple of examples of proactive and timely action by state regulatory commissions are worthy of note.
In April, the Michigan Public Service Commission issued an order that called for staff to meet with utilities and stakeholders to “identify potential impacts on meeting energy or demand savings targets and ways to mitigate such impacts and ensure program continuity.” As a good example of a practical response for preserving Michigan’s EERS, the resulting MPSC staff report is recommending rolling the 2020 utility energy efficiency goals into a new two-year goal framework, thereby preserving the original total savings for 2020 and 2021 programs combined. In the near term, the Commission also called for a particular focus on improving energy efficiency for low- to moderate-income families, with a special concern for helping with affordability.
In May, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission issued a notice requiring utilities to report to the Commission on “All Rate Regulated Electric and Gas Utilities’ Investments that May Assist in Minnesota’s Economic Recovery from the COVID‐19 Pandemic.” Commissioners specifically called for actions that “[i]ncrease access to conservation” and “reduce carbon or other pollutant emissions.” In response, Xcel submitted a proposal to expand energy efficiency and conservation programs and increase assistance to low-income customers.
While maintaining and even expanding energy efficiency program efforts during the COVID-19 crisis brings many challenges, they are not insurmountable. ACEEE recently provided practical suggestions and resources for sustaining these programs during restrictive times, and setting the stage for a strong resurgence when conditions permit.
These are challenging times. But continuing and enhancing aggressive energy efficiency policies and programs can support both the needed economic recovery and stronger action against climate change.

Three Steps Federal Agencies Can Take Toward a Better Climate;"Climate plans seem to be everywhere these days. Joe Biden released a new one shortly after the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis released its own. They join the draft CLEAN Future Act from the House Energy and Commerce Committee and a package of bills from Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other House Republicans.
We need bold legislation to slash greenhouse gas emissions and protect vulnerable communities. But enacting and implementing bold legislation takes time. As we work on that, federal agencies can do a lot to address climate change under existing law, and indeed, they are often required to. They should look at homes and commercial buildings, which are responsible for about 40% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and energy use. While state and local governments have the lead responsibility to limit energy waste and excess emissions from these buildings, the federal government also has important roles.
Here are three things federal agencies can do now—or early in 2021:
Set energy-saving standards for new manufactured homes.
Almost 100,000 new manufactured homes (also called mobile homes) were shipped last year, and almost seven million are in use, a majority by families with annual income under $30,000. Most residents pay energy bills that are far too high because the federal efficiency standard has not been updated since 1994. In 2007, Congress told the Department of Energy (DOE) to set a new standard, but buyers are still waiting. DOE can protect owners and tenants and cut emissions at the same time just by setting a standard like the energy code for “stick-built” homes. A negotiated standard proposed by DOE in 2016 (but never finalized) would have saved residents almost $4,000 over the lifetime of their home (net after the added cost) and cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 160 million metric tons.
Require 2021 building code for new homes receiving Federal Housing Administration loans.
The Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, and Veterans Affairs require new homes with FHA loans and other federally assisted mortgages to meet building energy codes, in part so energy waste does not prevent owners from being able to pay their mortgages. Again, these are often families that can’t afford the waste, and the requirements also apply to some public housing. Those loans include about a quarter of mortgages for new homes. But the criteria are mostly stuck at the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code (believe it or not, the VA’s requirements are much further behind). Using the new 2021 code would cut covered energy use by at least a third (assuming it is not weakened at the last minute). The agencies should adopt it and help builders learn how to meet it. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both effectively owned by the federal government since the last recession, could ensure that even more new homes are efficient.
Make federal buildings leaders in energy and water efficiency.
As the biggest energy user in the country, the federal government should ensure its own buildings lead the way to climate neutrality. New federal buildings are supposed to be 30% more efficient than code. But the reference for commercial buildings is still the 2013 code—the same old story. DOE should update it, but the president should go further. An executive order could direct new federal buildings to be state-of-the art in efficiency, to meet remaining power needs as much as possible from on-site renewables, and to help stabilize the electric grid. It also could restore energy- and water-saving targets for existing buildings and direct that they be made highly efficient when they are renovated—what are often called “deep retrofits,” the success of which has been demonstrated in more than a dozen federal buildings.
Clearly, federal agencies can craft policies with substantial impact. Just three policies under the Obama administration—fuel economy and emissions standards for cars and trucks, appliance efficiency standards, and the Clean Power Plan for existing power plants—were set to reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by as much as one billion tons a year by 2040, or by about a fifth. They also were set to save families and businesses $400 billion in energy each year.
The current administration has blocked as much of those savings as it could. Agencies have repealed the Clean Power Plan, rolled back standards for cars and light trucks, repealed or blocked standards for light bulbs, and changed the rulemaking processes to make it hard for the next administration to repair the damage. And yet, electric vehicles, LED lights, solar and wind power, and other technologies continue to get better and less expensive all the time, so savings opportunities are even greater now.
Should there be a new administration next year, it will need to reverse the damage as quickly as it can as part of sweeping efforts to address climate change. We know that reducing energy waste throughout the economy can cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half. But making all the homes, commercial buildings, appliances, manufacturing plants, cars, and trucks more efficient will take decades. The federal government can kick-start that process not just through big climate legislation, but by following the current law and updating its standards now.

Electric Truck Fleets Will Need a Lot of Power, but Many Utilities Aren’t Planning for It;"As more electric buses and trucks enter the market, future fleets will require a lot of electricity for charging. While some utilities in California and elsewhere are planning for an increase in power demand, many have yet to do so and need to get started.
This issue is critical, because freight trucks emit more than one-quarter of all vehicle emissions. Recent product developments offer growing opportunities to electrify trucks and buses and slash their emissions (see our recent white paper). And just last week, a group of 15 states plus DC announced plans to fully electrify truck sales by 2050. Utilities will need to be ready to power electric fleets.
Electric truck fleets need substantial power
Power for trucks and buses is generally more of an issue than for cars because trucks typically have larger batteries and because trucks and buses are often parts of fleets with many vehicles that charge at the same location. For example, a Tesla Model 3 battery stores 54-75 kWh; a Proterra transit bus battery stores 220-660 kWh. In Amsterdam, a 100-bus transit fleet is powered by a set of slow and fast chargers that together have a peak load of 13 MW (megawatts). This is equivalent to the power used by a typical large factory. And they are thinking of expanding the fleet to 250 buses.
Many other fleets will also need a lot of “juice.” For example, a rough estimate of the power needed to serve a fleet of 200 delivery vans at an Amazon fulfillment center is about 4 MW. And for electric 18-wheelers, chargers may need up to 2 MW of power each; a recent proposal calls for charging stations located every 100 miles along the U.S. West Coast’s I-5 corridor, each with a peak load of 23.5 MW.
Utilities need distribution planning
These examples show the need for more power at a given site than most utilities can provide without planning and investment. Meeting these needs will often require changes to primary and secondary power distribution systems (feeders that deliver power to distribution transformers and to end customers) and substation upgrades. For large loads, a new substation may be needed. A paper recently released by the California Electric Transportation Coalition estimates that for loads over 5 MW, distribution system and substation upgrades will be needed most of the time. According to the paper, typical utility costs are $1-9 million for substation upgrades, $150,000-6 million for primary distribution upgrades, and $5,000-100,000 for secondary distribution upgrades. Similarly, Black and Veatch, in a paper on Electric Fleets, also provides some general guidance, shown in the table below, while recognizing that each site is unique.
Now is the time to begin understanding where such upgrades will be needed and start planning for them.
California policy pushes utilities toward planning
California utilities are leading the way on this issue. In California, state agencies and a statewide effort called CALSTART have been funding demonstration projects and vehicle and charger purchases for several years. The California Air Resources Board voted in June to phase in zero-emission requirements for truck sales, mandating that, beginning in 2024, manufacturers must increase their zero-emission truck sales to 30-50% by 2030 and 40-75% by 2035. By 2035, more than 300,000 trucks will be zero-emission vehicles.
California utilities operate programs that work with fleet owners to install the necessary infrastructure for electric vehicle fleets. For example, Southern California Edison operates the Charge Ready Transport program for medium- and heavy-duty fleets. Normally, when customers request new or upgraded service from the utility, there are fees associated with the new upgrade. With Charge Ready, the utility generally pays these costs, and it will sometimes pay half the cost of chargers; the customer is responsible for the other half and for charger installation costs. Sites with at least two electric vehicles are eligible, but program managers report that at least five vehicles are often needed for the economics to make sense for the utility.
One way to do this is to develop and implement a phased plan, with some components sized for future planned growth and other components added as needed. Southern California Edison, for example, has 24 commitments so far, and has a 5-year goal of 870 sites, with an average of 10 chargers per site. The utility notes that one charger can usually serve several vehicles and that cycling of charging, some storage, and other load management techniques can reduce capacity needs (e.g., a nominal 10 MW load can often be reduced below 5 MW).
Through this program, utility representatives are regularly talking with fleet operators, and they can use these discussions to help identify needed upgrades to the utility grid. For example, California transit agencies are now doing the planning to meet a California Air Resources Board mandate for 100% electric or fuel cell buses by 2040; utilities are talking with the agencies and their consultants as part of this process. California utilities are finding that grid capacity is often adequate in the short term, but that upgrade needs will likely grow in the medium term (e.g., 7-10 years out). They can manage grid needs with good planning (e.g., school buses can generally be charged overnight and don’t need fast chargers), load management techniques, and some battery storage to address peak needs.
Customer conversations drive planning elsewhere
We also spoke with a northeastern utility (wishing to be unnamed) that has been talking with customers about many issues, including fleets. It has used these discussions to identify a few areas where grid upgrades might be needed if fleets electrify. It is factoring these findings into a broader grid-planning effort underway that is driven by multiple needs, including fleets. Even within an integrated planning effort, this utility is struggling with the question of when to take action to prepare the electric system for fleet electrification: Should it act on state or federal policy? Should it act when the specific customer request is submitted, or is there something in between? Recognizing that any option has scheduling and cost allocation implications, it notes that there are no easy answers.
Many utilities need to start paying attention
As part of our research, we also talked with several other utilities and found that they have not yet looked at how fleets might relate to grid planning. However, several of these companies are developing plans to look into these issues in the next year. We also talked with a major truck manufacturer, also wishing to remain unnamed, that views grid limitations as a key obstacle to truck electrification.  
Based on these cases, it appears that fleet electrification can have a substantial impact on electric grids and that, while these impacts are small at present, they will likely grow over time. Fleet owners, electric utilities, and utility regulators need to start planning for these impacts now, so that grid improvements can be made steadily as electric fleets grow. Fleet and grid planning should happen in parallel, so that grid upgrades do not happen sooner or later than needed but are in place when needed. These grid impacts can be managed and planned for, but the time to begin this planning is now.

Congress, States Can Enable Carbon Emissions Cuts From Freight With Better Planning;"Freight transport is responsible for a large—and rising—share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Despite great strides in truck efficiency and the potential to transition to electric trucks in many applications, vehicle improvements are not enough to deliver a sustainable freight sector. We need a freight network that is itself more efficient, with streamlined truck routing and loading, as well as greater use of trains and ships.
A new ACEEE report examines how state freight planning can advance efficient freight networks and shows how federal transportation law—which Congress is working to update right now—could help. In fact, Congress’s pending reauthorization of federal transportation programs may be the best opportunity for several years to help the freight sector chart a new course.
Read the Report
The U.S. House passed a transportation bill this month as part of a broader infrastructure bill. The bill included several helpful provisions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, though it missed some opportunities to enable emissions reductions from the freight sector. The Senate's transportation bill has only moved through committee, and it largely fails to tackle freight planning.
The last two federal transportation bills—MAP-21 and FAST Act—delivered much-needed funding opportunities for freight projects, but fell short of articulating a coherent national freight policy, especially with respect to freight’s impacts on the climate. This has consequences at the state level. While states must have approved freight plans in place to be eligible for federal funding, the plans are not currently required to show how states will reduce freight sector emissions.
 These days, many states are setting their own climate goals, and an efficient freight system will be important to meeting those goals. But for the most part, state climate efforts appear not to extend to freight planning.
State freight plans neglect climate
ACEEE reviewed state freight plans to understand whether and how, in the absence of clear federal direction, states sought to ensure that their freight projects and policies would improve efficiency and reduce emissions. We looked for explicit improvement targets as well as indirect approaches such as building a modally balanced freight system—essential given the high emissions per ton-mile of trucking—or using mobile computing and real-time data to minimize underutilized capacity in the system, for example.
We took a deeper dive into the plans of a few states we suspected, for a variety of reasons, might be ahead of the curve on freight planning. California emerged as the clear leader in our review, with a comprehensive (draft) freight plan that sets a goal of a 20% reduction in the carbon intensity of goods movement by 2030. Other states’ plans had features that could help to advance freight sustainability: Minnesota’s project planning is highly multimodal, while Nevada’s plan clearly defines a set of freight performance metrics and targets. However, only California could be said to have a strategy for emissions reduction. Without such a strategy, states will squander gains from cleaner trucks on offsetting increasing truck miles and may struggle to turn the freight sector emissions trajectory downward.
Getting a better freight plan in place should be on the agenda of any state working toward climate goals. Fortunately, the efficiency improvements that are key to greenhouse gas reduction will also produce a freight system that better supports economic activity.
Federal guidance needed
State and regional governments drive freight policy and planning, with input from freight industry and community stakeholders. But a well-defined national freight policy is essential as well, especially when it comes to sustainability and the environment. As a major funder of freight projects, the federal government must ensure that the national interest is served with those dollars.
The House infrastructure bill takes a step in that direction by specifying that reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and local pollution is a goal of national freight policy. It also raises the cap on the amount of funding that can go to non-highway freight projects and provides funding for freight projects emphasizing “operational, technological, and mode shift strategies,” which should help. These provisions should make their way into the final bill.
 But beyond those provisions, the bill should require state freight plans to define and advance sustainability goals, and it should provide tools to help states deliver. A performance measure for freight carbon dioxide emissions would be a good start—just assembling the information needed to set a baseline and target would help states get a handle on the often-elusive data required to understand the impacts of goods movement. Other planning requirements, from mode-share targets to data-sharing protocols, would also help. These steps to improve freight system efficiency should be added to the transportation bill as it makes its way through Congress.

Energy Efficiency Appears Prominently in New Climate Plans;"Energy efficiency appears prominently in recent proposals to address climate change, underscoring its ability to deliver dramatic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.
Nationwide building retrofits, net zero construction, fuel efficiency, electric vehicles, and industrial decarbonization — cornerstones of ACEEE’s new Call to Action — are features of several sweeping proposals. Research shows that these and other robust efficiency-related measures can halve U.S. energy use and emissions by 2050.
This week, former Vice President Joe Biden unveiled a climate plan that consolidates several Democratic proposals. By spending $2 trillion over four years, it aims to slash emissions, revive the economy, reduce racial inequities, and by 2035, derive all electricity from carbon-free sources. It sees energy efficiency as a key way to cut emissions and make energy more affordable for low-income households and communities of color, which have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and climate change.
Earlier this year, a group of House Republicans led by House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) introduced its own climate plan. This plan focuses on removing carbon dioxide from the air rather than reducing energy waste or promoting zero-carbon energy sources. It seeks to plant a trillion trees, which President Trump has endorsed, and expand a tax break, which Trump signed in 2018, to capture and sequester carbon dioxide before it leaves smokestacks. It would also increase federal R&D funding for carbon capture at natural gas plants. 
The Biden plan has multiple efficiency provisions. It calls for energy-efficient retrofits of four million commercial buildings and weatherization of two million homes over four years, which it estimates will create at least one million jobs. It proposes building performance standards, strict building codes as well as cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade and electrify home appliances and install more efficient windows. It suggests a technology-neutral Energy Efficiency and Clean Electricity Standard (EECES) for utilities and grid operators.
In the transportation sector, Biden proposes increased spending on public transit, walkways, and bike lanes. He seeks to establish ambitious fuel economy standards; provide consumer rebates to swap old, less energy-efficient vehicles for newer, more efficient ones; buy clean vehicles for federal, state, tribal, postal, and local fleets; promote electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure; and convert all 500,000 U.S. school buses to zero emissions.
The plan also mentions the need to decarbonize industry. It calls for creating an Advanced Research Projects Agency on Climate, a cross-agency ARPA-C, that would — among other things — advance technologies for decarbonizing industrial heat needed to make steel, concrete, and chemicals and for developing carbon-neutral construction materials.
Biden’s new plan has similarities to the House Select Committee on Climate Crisis’ recent majority report, and incorporates many of the recommendations of the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force, which was co-crafted with supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
While Rep. McCarthy’s climate plan focuses on carbon sequestration, Republicans have included energy efficiency measures in several bills. For example, the pending bipartisan Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act by Sens. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) would promote better building energy codes and mortgage lending that recognizes the value of efficiency in homes. An ACEEE analysis shows it would cut energy bills by $51 billion, save 32 quadrillion Btu of energy, and avoid 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions cumulatively for measures through 2050.
Conservatives for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES), a nonprofit that engages GOP policymakers, has endorsed the Portman-Shaheen bill and other bipartisan ones. Such bills include the New Home Energy Efficiency Act to extend and update the home energy efficiency tax credit through 2022 and the Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act to help schools make efficiency retrofits.
What happens to any of these proposals or pending bills remains to be seen. Congressional approval could be difficult if Congress remains largely deadlocked by partisanship. Yet the inclusion of robust energy efficiency measures highlights its importance in the fight against climate change.

Efficiency Programs Can Expand by Leveraging Health-Focused Funding;"Home weatherization can improve people’s health, yet efficiency programs operate nearly in isolation from public health efforts. A new ACEEE report shows how efficiency programs can leverage federal funding focused on health—potentially as much as $2 billion annually—to expand their offerings and serve more people. 
Read the report
“Programs to improve home energy efficiency are in many respects already public health efforts—though we often don’t realize it,” says Sara Hayes, director of ACEEE’s health and environment program and a report co-author. “We focus on utilities and the federal weatherization program to fund efficiency work, but we should also be looking to funding from the health sector.”
Better insulating a home and sealing it from the outdoors can reduce indoor air contaminants and help control moisture and mold. As a result, these improvements can reduce some asthma symptoms and upper respiratory risks. Efficiency measures also reduce exposure to extreme temperatures, which are especially dangerous for infants and older adults. In-home programs can provide complementary services that can help identify and mitigate an even wider range of in-home health threats such as carbon monoxide exposure, fall hazards, respiratory irritants and other asthma triggers, fire risk, radon, lead, and more.
The U.S. Department of Energy funds the Weatherization Assistance Program, contributing to improvements in the health of participants. But funding from other federal agencies aimed at improving public health has generally not been leveraged to support in-home energy efficiency efforts, though several of these federal programs clearly allow funds to be used in this way.
This new ACEEE report identifies six federal programs that could potentially fund in-home energy efficiency efforts.
The State Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), for instance, helps states pay for health care and related costs for many low-income families with children. CHIP already funds in-home health interventions, such as several state programs that reduce lead exposure. An energy efficiency program administrator could work with a state’s CHIP administrator to apply for matching funds.
Medicaid has already been used to fund home efficiency work, though on a small scale. A $10 million pilot program recently announced by New York State Energy Research & Development Authority is anticipated to be fully funded through Medicaid, pointing the way for others.
The Treasury Department’s Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act grants, the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Lead Hazard Control Grants, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Asthma Control Program and Preventive Health and Health Service Block Grant round out the funding sources explored in the report.
Using these funding sources is novel and may require action and engagement by programs administrators and state policymakers, but the opportunity is significant. The new ACEEE report aims to help program administrators and advocates “braid” together energy efficiency and health-focused funding sources to provide a wider range of in-home services.
“Braiding these funds is an opportunity for efficiency programs to expand services and reach more people, particularly low-income households, where current funding is far inadequate to meet the needs,” says Hayes. “Embracing the connection between efficiency and improved health will empower program administrators to have even greater impact, and that’s what we want to see.”
Report co-author Christine Gerbode will speak about the new research as part of a Department of Energy-sponsored webinar, “Energy-Efficiency Funding for Residential Programs: Challenges and Opportunities,” on July 23 from 1:00-2:30 pm ET.

How Can We Electrify Industry to Fight Climate Change? Q&A With Ed Rightor;"Beneficial electrification stands out as one of the best ways to decarbonize industry. An ACEEE report released today shows that while it is gaining ground in several sectors, including metals and chemicals, its rapid scaling in industry still faces hurdles and will require considerable investment in R&D, clean power sources, and energy storage.
Read the report
To fight climate change, increased industrial use of electricity from zero- or low-carbon sources (known as beneficial electrification) will be critical. The U.S. industrial sector, which includes manufacturing, accounts for 28% of the nation’s primary energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (22% excluding feedstocks).
Electrification is a promising strategy for many industrial sectors. Across the United States, there are already many good examples to emulate and opportunities to pursue. To learn more, we talked with Ed Rightor, director of ACEEE’s industrial program and lead author of the new report, Beneficial Electrification in Industry. Ed, along with three other speakers, will discuss this topic in a webinar today.
Register for Webinar
Why is it so important that we electrify industrial processes as quickly as possible?
We’re generating more and more of our electricity from renewable resources, and that’s going to need to keep increasing quickly. As that happens, it’s crucial to electrify industrial processes so they can take advantage of that lower-carbon grid-supplied electricity; this is a key step to allow us to reduce GHGs. We really need to work on this transition right now for industrial facilities to take full advantage of a far greener grid in the coming years.
What are the most promising examples of electrification that you see today?
Promising examples include electric technologies for moderate-temperature process heat, materials processing (e.g., infrared, microwave, induction heating), advanced machine drives, and intermittent fuel switching (e.g., hybrid boilers that can use either gas or electricity). 
We can accelerate the adoption of these technologies, as well as emerging and transformative technologies, with partnerships at concentrated industrial zones and industrial parks (e.g., the Houston Ship Channel, Port of Los Angeles, Indiana steel mills) that lower adoption hurdles, test new technology, and establish infrastructure to support low-carbon solutions.
Are there any low-hanging fruit that industry should focus on?
Early opportunities include improving the energy efficiency of electric equipment that is already in use (e.g., motor drives, compressed air), the use of hybrid boilers, and the use of electric technologies to provide moderate-temperature heat (heat pumps, modular steam generation units, and infrared heating). 
ACEEE has launched an Industrial Decarbonization Initiative. What are its goals?
We’re enabling a future where industry’s combined energy and GHG footprint approaches net zero and where industry can make a crucial contribution to reducing global GHGs 80% by 2050. 
Our multi-pronged strategy includes:
Convening industry, labor, and NGO stakeholders to identify common ground on policies to enable industrial decarbonization.
Pursuing research and best practices that facilitate the shift of industry to net-zero GHGs by 2050.
Catalyzing partnerships among government, business, and NGOs for decarbonization.
Industry is known to be risk-averse and has a lot of expensive equipment that lasts a long time, which is an obstacle to replacing existing equipment with efficient new equipment. What can we do about this?
Early pursuit of low-capital options is a great place to start. These options include energy efficiency, fuel switching, and adoption of low-capital, low-carbon approaches like low-temperature process heat or materials preparation with electric technologies. By highlighting the value of nonenergy benefits (e.g., improved productivity; better product quality, environmental compliance, capacity, safety, and waste reduction), we can often justify equipment replacement and minimize risk.
In your report, you talk about the importance of smart manufacturing profiles. What are these and why do they matter?
Smart manufacturing (SM) uses information and computer technology to increase flexibility in production while reducing waste of materials and energy. SM profiles provide an industry-standard way to create sharable digital templates for any manufacturing asset (like a piece of industrial equipment or machinery), allowing digital data communication and analytics. The profiles allow direct measurement of energy consumption in real time so that it can be managed more effectively, thereby reducing energy use and GHG emissions.
When we collect such data from numerous pieces of equipment, we are essentially crowdsourcing expertise to create profiles. Using these profiles for electric technologies could help accelerate adoption of new technology and quantification of energy and nonenergy benefits. Then, any company with a certain type of machine or asset can leverage its capabilities to optimize both GHG reductions and productivity.
The industrial sector accounts for a lot of jobs and exports. How do we decarbonize industry without harming either?
We can do a few things. First, we can incentivize electrification in discrete and process manufacturing, and we can provide connections to low-carbon energy so that electrification can be beneficial. Second, we can deploy cross-functional teams to the top 500 GHG-emitting manufacturing facilities to do energy audits and provide training and technical assistance under the DOE’s existing Better Plants program. Third, we can rebuild supply chains devastated by COVID-19 by enabling digitization and smart manufacturing, and by minimizing hurdles and restrictions associated with the pandemic. Last, we can work with local industries to identify and train workers to fill jobs working with electric technologies, and quickly get new employees up to speed on the new equipment.

Weatherization Cuts Bills and Creates Jobs but Serves Only a Tiny Share of Low-income Homes;"As the summer heat increases home cooling needs and energy bills for many families, the Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) can cut costs, but it remains dramatically underfunded.
Home weatherization provides a long-term, much-needed solution for energy affordability for many low-income families who live in older buildings with less-efficient appliances and equipment. It also improves comfort and health at a time when more people are staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic and creates jobs, which are badly needed now. Even though weatherization reduces energy bills and provides health benefits, such as reduced asthma risk, funding from the Department of Energy (DOE) for WAP doesn’t currently meet the demand and needs of low-income households.
The National Association for State Community Services Programs’ (NASCSP) most recent funding survey, published in May, estimates that WAP funding from DOE and other leveraged sources weatherized 90,541 homes in 2018. About 30% of U.S. households, or 38.6 million households, are eligible for weatherization. This means that only about 0.2% of low-income households in the United States receive much-needed weatherization services each year.
  NASCSP’s funding survey also shows that WAP’s funding has increased in recent years, but not enough to meet the overwhelming need. In addition, the weatherization program has wisely shifted in recent years to focus on deeper, more comprehensive retrofits and stronger quality work plan and inspection requirements, all of which can save more energy and reduce costs further. Because of this greater investment per home, the number of homes weatherized annually has actually decreased.
Weatherization funding can and should be increased. Just last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an infrastructure bill that called for a significant increase in program funding, up to $1 billion in 2025. Congress is also working to set weatherization funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year.
Increased investment in weatherization through federal programs, utility ratepayer-funded programs, and other sources can help revitalize our economy in recession by creating jobs, improving community resilience and public health, and reducing the wealth gap and energy insecurity.
ACEEE’s Energy Efficiency Impact Report, published in December 2019, includes additional data related to energy efficiency investments and impacts over time.

House Infrastructure Bill’s Efficiency Provisions Would Create Jobs and Cut Carbon Emissions;"Washington, DC — Energy efficiency provisions included in infrastructure legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representative Wednesday would stimulate a struggling economy while making long-term investments in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and vehicles.
“Efficiency in this bill wouldn’t just create badly-needed jobs, it would be an investment in making our buildings and vehicles more energy efficient and less costly to run for generations,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “People ask what the pandemic means for the climate, and the truth is, it depends on whether or not we enact policies like these. This is an opportunity for Congress to stimulate the economy while lowering our greenhouse gas emissions for the long haul.”
The bill, dubbed the Moving America Forward Act, includes provisions to update and renew tax incentives encouraging efficient home and building construction and upgrades (though further updates are needed), extend credits for electric vehicles and chargers, and add a credit for electric trucks.
It would authorize programs to train energy efficiency workers and provide rebates to homeowners who retrofit their houses, increase funding to weatherize homes of low-income families, extend efficiency requirements in federal buildings; improve the efficiency of public schools and of other public buildings; and help local governments implement efficiency and renewable energy projects.
The transportation section of the bill includes measures to help steer some federal funding toward local projects that enable lower-carbon transportation and better mobility, and invest in a network of electric vehicle charging stations.
“More than 400,000 energy efficiency workers have filed for unemployment since the pandemic began. We could put them and many more back to work if Congress passed and funded these efficiency provisions,” said Nadel.
The bill now moves to the U.S. Senate, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has criticized it and President Trump has threatened to veto it.

House Climate Committee Embraces Ambitious Efficiency Measures in Wide-Ranging Plan;"Washington, DC — In a long-awaited report issued Tuesday, the U.S. House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis includes a set of robust policies to reduce energy waste as part of a wide-ranging blueprint for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
“This report recognizes the critical role of energy efficiency in meeting the climate crisis while strengthening the economy,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “In order to slash carbon emissions, we need to put people to work on cutting energy waste in homes and commercial buildings, decarbonizing industry, and creating a low carbon transportation system. The committee has done tremendous work identifying many of the key solutions; the challenge now is getting them done.”
The committee recommends a strong set of policies, including measures aiming to:
Shift industry to become climate-neutral by mid-century through a suite of actions to support the transition of a complex sector with energy efficiency being a leading strategy, including policies to ensure the competitiveness of the sector while supporting good jobs in communities with the greatest needs;
Transform the transportation sector, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of electric vehicles through a national Zero Emission Vehicle target and a call for states and metropolitan planning organizations to set ambitious goals for transportation-related carbon emissions;
Reduce energy waste in buildings, including through provisions to accelerate retrofits of existing homes and multifamily buildings, with special attention to those inhabited by low and moderate income families; promote highly efficient zero energy new homes and buildings; and promote deep energy-saving retrofits of buildings that are undergoing other substantial renovation;
Establish nationwide savings targets for utility energy efficiency programs that are based on maximum achievable levels and that account for the greenhouse gas pollution reduction benefits of efficiency. In addition, establish a federal price on greenhouse gas emissions.
ACEEE submitted extensive recommendations to the committee in November in response to its request for information and has worked with the committee in its consultation with stakeholders. ACEEE research last year found that energy efficiency improvements alone can cut greenhouse gas emissions in the United State by 50% by 2050.

The Energy Efficiency Sector Can Help Address Longstanding Health Inequities;"The COVID-19 pandemic underscores how living conditions can adversely affect communities of color and how energy efficiency programs can help by improving these conditions.
 People of color have been disproportionately killed by COVID-19. One study shows that Black Americans are 3.6 times more likely to die from it than white Americans, and Latinx individuals are at least 1.9 times as likely to die compared to whites. Counties in the United States with a Black majority have six times the rate of COVID-19 deaths relative to counties with a white majority.
 African Americans have long experienced higher death rates than whites for a long list of deadly harms: heart disease, stroke, cancer, asthma, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and homicide. The health inequities highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic emphasize the urgent need to rectify the underlying conditions, known as the social determinants of health, that threaten communities of color. Perhaps surprisingly, social and economic factors — as well as physical environment — have a far stronger impact than medical care on health outcomes, including length and quality of life.
What determines health? Social and economic factors are as powerful as health behaviors and health care combined.

A major factor is housing. Black families, which are 60% more likely than white families to live in inadequate housing conditions, face disproportionate exposure to pollution and toxins, safety hazards, high energy burdens, and economic instability, all of which undermine their health and welfare. By improving living conditions in overburdened communities, we can begin to mitigate the underlying causes of death and disease.
Energy efficiency programs can address a variety of social and economic factors that affect health. They reduce exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, moisture and mold, and infiltration by rats, cockroaches, and other pests, while protecting occupants from extreme temperatures. They address basic safety concerns such as smoke and radon and the need for carbon monoxide detectors and handrails.
These programs can also improve financial security of families. They reduce energy burdens — the share of income spent on utility bills — and create jobs in the communities they serve. These improvements, in turn, can reduce stress, another contributor to adverse health outcomes. The nationwide network of energy efficiency programs can be leveraged to deliver in-home health services to help prevent falls and diseases such as asthma and obesity.
The energy efficiency sector can begin to help right longstanding injustices by addressing unsafe living conditions faced by so many in our society. Energy efficiency programs won’t end the COVID-19 pandemic or cure diseases that have long burdened Black communities, but they can be part of the solution.

Programs to Electrify Space Heating Are Growing;"Across the United States, programs that electrify space heating in homes and buildings — primarily using high-efficiency heat pumps — are growing rapidly. An ACEEE topic brief released today shows that current-year budgets for the 23 programs we reviewed are nearly $110 million, up 70% from the prior year.
Read the Topic Brief
These programs are most extensive on the West Coast and in the Northeast, but are beginning in other regions as well. Many of these programs are run by utilities (investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative) but some are run by states, cities, and independent organizations designated by states. While space heating electrification programs are early in their evolution, many are refining their approaches, adjusting incentives, adding components, and piloting complementary approaches.  
These programs build on a policy framework in several states (discussed in a recent post) that promotes decarbonizing electricity generation and then using this cleaner electricity to replace fossil fuels where feasible and practical.  
In areas with high use of delivered fuels (fuel oil and propane), such as the Northeast, many programs target customers using these fuels, because the economics of electrification in these situations are often better than when displacing natural gas. Likewise, a few programs, such as in California, Connecticut, Illinois, and Michigan, are encouraging all-electric new construction — another market segment with favorable economics.  
Most programs encourage weatherization to reduce loads when buying a new heat pump, and about one-third require it. The bulk of program participants use heat pumps and existing fossil fuel systems, with the latter operating on very cold days when the heat pump cannot handle the full heating load.  
An increasing number of programs are looking to encourage heat pumps as primary heating systems. In regions with growing use of air conditioning, ductless heat pumps are a popular way to add both supplemental heat and efficient air conditioning to homes that are difficult to retrofit with central air conditioning. 
Several programs offer upstream incentives to contractors or distributors, finding that such an approach increases participation. High incentives, such as those enabled by allowing credit for fossil fuel savings and not just electric savings, and/or by putting value on greenhouse gas emissions reductions, also increase participation. 
Electrifying water heaters 
While our topic brief focuses on heat pumps for space heating, programs to promote heat pump water heaters are also extensive.  
For example, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) measures its success based on avoided carbon; it has a program to encourage homes with gas water heaters to install electric heat pump water heaters when an existing water heater needs replacement. It offers $3,000 incentives for converting to heat pump water heaters; these incentives typically cover more than 90% of the costs of the new water heater, including conversion costs. In 2019, more than 1,000 heat pump water heaters were installed. The pace picked up in 2020, with 436 units installed in the first quarter. 
Likewise, the California Public Utilities Commission earlier this year approved $45 million for utility heat pump water heater programs through the Self-Generation Incentive Program (which is separate from energy efficiency funding). 
Electrifying vehicles and commercial buildings 
Programs to date emphasize the residential sector. While commercial applications are often eligible, they are usually not targeted, and where targeted, the emphasis is on smaller buildings. Analysts and programs are just starting to consider electrification opportunities in the commercial sector — ACEEE will release a report on this subject in the fall. 
There are also large electrification opportunities in transportation, with many state and utility programs promoting electric cars, trucks, and buses, as well as the charging infrastructure and rates needed to support electric vehicle (EV) deployment. For example, Southern California Edison has an approximately $350 million, 5-year Charge Ready Transport Program to support the infrastructure for heavy duty EVs. Pacific Gas & Electric has a similar program, and San Diego Gas & Electric will be starting its program later this year.  
Likewise, programs in a number of states are assisting with charging and vehicle purchases in low- and moderate-income communities. (ACEEE will have a report on these charging station programs next year.) 
While COVID-19 and the recession are affecting these programs in the short term, the increased pre-pandemic activity shows that decarbonization through electrification is gaining attention — attention that will likely grow as more and more policymakers, businesses, and consumers embrace decarbonization.

Report: Cities, States Must Mandate Building Retrofits to Meet Climate Crisis;"Washington, DC — Retrofitting buildings to reduce their energy use is one of the most powerful tools to reduce carbon emissions, yet at current rates, most offices and homes will not be retrofitted for decades or even centuries, a new report warns. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) report, released Monday, calls for cities and states to mandate retrofits of inefficient buildings by requiring them to meet standards that cap their energy use or carbon emissions—a policy that 10 leading jurisdictions have adopted, including many in just the past 18 months.
Read the White Paper
ACEEE finds that building performance standards could greatly reduce the nearly one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that come from buildings. If applied to two-thirds of existing buildings, these standards could reduce carbon emissions in 2050 by more than the current annual emissions from all buildings, power plants, and vehicles in New York state.
“We have lots of good voluntary programs that help building owners improve energy efficiency, but the truth is they’re just not nearly enough when you look at the climate math,” said Steven Nadel, report co-author and executive director of ACEEE. “Most buildings today are going to be in use for decades to come. If we don’t put any limits on the carbon they’re responsible for, we’ll be locking in terrible climate impacts. Building performance standards are an effective response because policymakers set overall limits and let the building owners decide which upgrades they’re going to implement to meet them.”
“Burning fossil fuels to provide heat and hot water to homes and buildings is not only bad for the climate, it pollutes the air and threatens public health. As cities, counties, and states look for significant ways to address the climate crisis, tackling inefficient buildings is a must,” said Antha Williams, global head of environmental programs at Bloomberg Philanthropies, a partner supporting the report. “The good news is that we are seeing cities across the country take meaningful action by setting ambitious energy standards for buildings and working with owners to help achieve them. We look forward to seeing more city council members and mayors across the country stepping up to implement these types of policies as a major part of their climate plans.”
In the past 18 months, Washington, D.C., New York City, Washington state, and St. Louis have enacted building performance standards. Such standards are also in place in Boulder (Colorado), Reno (Nevada), Tokyo, France, the Netherlands and England/Wales. Similar proposals are under consideration in Boston, Colorado, and Montgomery County, Maryland, among other places.
The policies typically require existing buildings larger than a specified size to meet a certain energy efficiency standard, based on either energy use or greenhouse gas emissions per square foot of space. This effectively requires owners of less-efficient buildings to make efficiency upgrades by certain deadlines, generally several years in the future. Building owners can use any combination of efficiency upgrades to meet the standard, such as improved heating and cooling, new insulation, upgraded windows, or a host of other measures. Some of the standards apply only to rental properties and a few of the European standards apply to homes.
The report notes wide variation among existing policies and calls for policymakers considering building performance standards to consult local stakeholders in developing policies to meet local needs. It calls on jurisdictions that set such policies to devote resources to educating building owners and managers, providing technical assistance, offering financing and incentives, and ensuring effective enforcement.

8 Ways Efficiency Programs Can Retool During The Crisis And Plan For A Strong Recovery;"Energy efficiency programs that were largely halted by the COVID-19 crisis have adapted significantly, but now must restructure and retool in preparation for resuming full operations.
The imperative is clear: Efficiency programs remain vital for households and businesses to reduce their energy costs, including for those bearing the highest burdens, and to cut carbon emissions.
Energy efficiency programs are not like water faucets that can be easily turned back on when they have been turned off. Well-trained workers, for instance, may find employment in other industries if their efficiency jobs are put on hold indefinitely (more than 400,000 efficiency workers filed for unemployment in March and April). Program infrastructure must be maintained so that they can regain full speed when conditions permit.
Ensuring that these programs are not permanently set back by the COVID-19 crisis will require adapting to reduce direct human contact, focus resources on the most affected communities, and closely re-examine program services. 
To respond to the new realities and manage through the evolving crisis, we recommend eight ways that efficiency programs can adjust to the current situation and plan for the future:
Programs must react to new realities
1. Continue virtually
At the onset of stay-at-home orders, programs quickly halted all services that involve direct contact with customers, such as home assessments and on-site installations of energy-efficient technologies. Many programs have expanded or established virtual means to provide services. Examples include:
Virtual home/building energy assessments, energy efficiency “treasure hunts,” virtual verification of energy efficiency measure installation.
Promotion of online energy marketplaces—portals for purchasing energy-efficient products technologies, typically offered with program incentives.
Administrative flexibility—moving funding to support virtual services, streamlining processing of incentive payments to customers and contractors to keep money flowing, allowing partial payment for work in progress.
2. Build new participant pipelines and leverage available opportunities
A lot of program work can happen without direct customer contact, including planning and developing projects. Many types of energy efficiency measures can be installed and many projects move forward while adhering to public health guidelines. For example, programs can target vacant schools/offices (where applicable) and mechanical rooms now. One emerging idea is for programs delivering lighting, controls, and HVAC upgrades to partner with COVID-19 upgrade projects, such as dividers for open-space offices and improved air quality systems.
3. Engage and educate customers
With so many people staying at home, programs have a unique opportunity to engage with their customers to educate, inform, and motivate them to take actions to reduce their energy use and save money. Utilities in several states, including New York, Ohio, and Texas, have sent their customers specific advice on saving energy while they are at home during the day. Programs can expand and create new on-line resources, tools, and messages to increase their outreach to customers, identify and take advantage of immediate energy savings opportunities, and plan for longer-term improvements. For example, Xcel Colorado is pairing virtual audits with deliveries of no-cost do-it-yourself kits and virtual installation support, as well as follow up “virtual visits” to confirm installations and plan next steps. Consumers Energy is providing 100,000 smart thermostats to its customers during the pandemic through its online energy marketplace.   
4. Train program staff and contractors
Program contractors and trade allies have been hit hard by the restrictions on direct customer contact. Programs can use this time to train program staff and contractors who are unable to work. Such training includes typical professional development and skills, as well as training on new guidelines and practices to ensure health and safety. For example, state officials in New York have developed guidelines and are coordinating free on-line training opportunities for clean energy contractors in response to the pandemic. Similar training and supporting resources are available to energy efficiency contractors serving utilities in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire.
Build for New Conditions
As the crisis conditions ease, programs can begin to look ahead to resuming full operations. Things will be different, however. To maintain momentum and ultimately emerge stronger as restrictions are removed, efficiency programs can:
5. Pivot and adapt programs to continue serving customers while adhering to public health guidelines and restrictions
Programs can focus on measures and approaches that minimize or eliminate direct customer contact, like the Massachusetts program prioritizing wall insulation that can be accessed from the outside and other on-premises work outside customer-occupied areas. Programs must procure personal protective equipment for workers, and can be retooled to support healthy homes and buildings.
6. Focus on the communities most heavily impacted by COVID-19
COVID-19 has dramatically increased the number of unemployed families facing affordability challenges, and it has disproportionally affected communities of color, especially Black communities. Portfolios should shift to focus on underserved people, and administrators should retarget and identify these customers. To ensure these customers can participate, states and utilities should adjust incentives and financing terms to enable participation by those most affected by the crisis financially. Program administrators should consider increasing incentive levels for highly affected communities. For example, utilities in Connecticut have increased incentives for energy efficiency measures—up to 100% of costs in some cases—and NYSERDA in New York is offering more-generous financing terms. 
7. Use experience gained from this crisis to re-examine, streamline, and improve program designs and services
Program changes to protect health and safety in the pandemic can provide opportunities to reduce costs and improve services as normal conditions return. For example, programs can make greater use of online and mobile apps to gather customer data needed to assess energy efficiency opportunities and evaluate program impacts. Virtual means can be used to verify installation and performance of measures. This may require loosening of existing stringent in-person/on-site evaluation, measurement, and verification requirements, as utility regulators have done in California.
8. Manage funds so efficiency can be a tool for economic recovery
Many programs are not spending their full budgets due to slow-downs and shifts in services. We recommend that such accrued program funding be used, where possible, to accelerate and expand program services once full operations can resume. Administrators can plan for a program surge to regain progress toward meeting program saving targets.
Like all parts of our economy, energy efficiency programs have suffered a severe blow from the pandemic. Nonetheless, these programs have continued to provide limited services, some getting back into the field, and with leaders creatively pivoting to meet the challenge of this moment as conditions change. By following the recommendations we’ve outlined, programs can continue to provide vital services to customers and prepare to rebound—and help reduce energy costs during a prolonged economic recovery while also cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

These Seven Strategies Can Help Mayors Save Money and Revive Local Economies;"As city leaders focus on mitigating the hardships wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, a toolkit released today by ACEEE offers them seven energy-saving strategies to help revive and strengthen urban economies. Cities all over the country, from Seattle to Cincinnati, provide examples of how these strategies are getting results.
Regardless of a city’s size or how far along it is on its clean energy journey, mayors can be catalysts for change. They have the power to set policy and help create a culture that reduces and accurately values energy consumption. With elections around the corner, this toolkit can also be used as part of a mayoral candidate’s clean energy and economic development platforms. Sixty-three percent of Americans prefer to conserve energy to solve our nation’s energy problems, compared to 32% who prefer to produce more fossil fuels.
The toolkit shows that these seven strategies are especially promising and effective, and it offers examples of cities that have put these strategies into action.
Develop, implement, and communicate an energy efficiency vision for the city Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer assembled the city’s first Office of Sustainability & Resilience to implement the Green Works Orlando initiative. This office coordinates with city departments and community stakeholders to ensure the effectiveness of sustainability planning efforts, including community-wide energy reductions of 45% below 2010 levels by 2040.
Increase the energy efficiency of local government operations In 2014, Bemidji, Minnesota, which has a population of just over 15,000, took advantage of an energy service performance contract (ESPC) to upgrade eight city buildings, a wastewater treatment plant, and streetlights.
Scale up energy efficiency in existing buildings In 2018, the Council of the District of Columbia adopted mandatory building energy performance standards for large buildings, including multifamily buildings. Only three cities, plus the state of Washington, have adopted these ambitious policies.
Encourage energy efficiency in new construction In 2018, Philadelphia became the third U.S. jurisdiction to adopt the 2018 International Energy Conservation Code. Mayor Jim Kenney said the city’s commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement, as well as its efforts to ensure that buildings meet the highest standards of safety and quality, motivated the update.
Promote energy efficient transportation Los Angeles partnered with the Shared-Use Mobility Center and the California Air Resources Board to launch an electric vehicle carsharing project focused on serving low-income residents.
Prioritize transportation efficiency in zoning and development Portland’s zoning code encourages mixed-use development of vacant or underused properties along nearly all the city’s main commercial streets and throughout most of its downtown, which serves as the region’s business and cultural hub.
Leverage and maximize utility energy efficiency offerings In 2014, Minneapolis entered a unique partnership with its two major utilities—Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy—to help the city achieve its clean energy goals.
The energy efficiency industry, the largest in the clean energy sector, has faced serious setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, losing more than 400,000 jobs. One thing the pandemic has not changed is that energy efficiency remains a strategy city leadership can use to save money for cities, residents, and business owners, help meet climate goals, and get people back to work! Energy efficiency jobs are almost impossible to outsource, as most critical services require contractors and other skilled professionals to work in and provide value to the local community.
This toolkit emphasizes recommendations that are low cost, prioritize equity and inclusivity, and are accessible to cities of all shapes and sizes. Energy efficiency is an economic driver that can get people to work and reduce energy costs for municipal facility managers, renters, and everyone in between. Energy efficiency has always been and continues be the most environmentally friendly energy source because the greenest fuel is that which is never produced or burned.

New Jersey Regulators Enable Major Progress on Energy Efficiency;"Washington, DC — A New Jersey Board of Public Utilities order issued on Wednesday sets the stage for the state’s utilities to implement far more ambitious energy efficiency programs that help households and businesses reduce energy costs.
“This order is a big win for ratepayers and the climate, because it will help cut utility bills and heat-trapping carbon emissions,” said Rachel Gold, utilities program director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “Now it’s up to the utilities and the New Jersey Division of Clean Energy to get the job done and deliver results.”
“The order is also great news for economic development in the state during the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for the many small businesses that deliver energy efficiency services to families and other companies,” said Gold.
The board’s action stems from the state’s 2018 Clean Energy Act, which included provisions requiring utilities to help customers reduce electric use by 2% and gas use by .75% each year. The new order requires utilities and the state’s Division of Clean Energy to go beyond these goals and meet annual energy savings targets that ramp up to 2.15% of electric use and 1.1% of gas use in the fifth program year. It takes these steps to help them achieve that:
It defines a more central role for utilities to deliver energy-saving programs and shifts the state’s role to oversight and programs that require coordination with other state policy-led efforts;
It establishes a performance-based cost recovery mechanism to incentivize utilities to maximize the energy savings they help their customers achieve and to compensate utilities for lost revenue;
It sets a process for future updates and community engagement to ensure the success of energy efficiency efforts over time, including expansion of the Energy Efficiency Advisory Group to include working groups on workforce development; equity; evaluation, measurement, and verification (including codes and standards); and marketing.
“In the last few years, New Jersey has struggled to move out of the middle of the pack nationally on energy efficiency policy, but if the utilities are successful in implementing the order, that will change now, big time,” said Gold. “The commissioners and staff deserve praise for working to make a smart policy, especially during the pandemic.”
ACEEE previously submitted comments on draft proposals for this order earlier this year and provided technical assistance on these issues throughout the implementation process.

These States Are Showing How To Encourage The Lowest-Carbon HVAC;"With renewable power generation surpassing coal in the United States for the first time in more than 100 years, the carbon intensity of electricity continues its dramatic decline. This means that technologies using electricity instead of fossil fuels—like electric heat pumps—are now often the lowest-carbon choice for heating a home and the water in it, as well as cooling it. They are also often the most energy-efficient choice. Yet efficiency policies for the buildings sector in most of the country are not incentivizing homeowners or businesses to install these technologies. Fortunately, lawmakers and regulators in an increasing number of states, including California and New York, are tackling the problem and showing the way forward.
The challenge stems from laws and regulations that fail to encourage—or outright prohibit—energy efficiency programs from helping households or businesses make upgrades that involve replacing fuel-burning equipment with electric-powered systems.
State efficiency policies have tended to set up silos based on the energy source they seek to save, which has generally either been electricity or natural gas. On the one hand, those silos are established by design and can be highly successful at reducing emissions. For example, mandatory electricity savings targets for utilities have been successful and are needed to meet long-term carbon goals.
On the other hand, electricity savings targets are not sufficient on their own because they do not explicitly encourage low-carbon and low-cost energy solutions that require “fuel switching.” Electricity targets miss cost-effective savings that would require switching from fuels outside of the regulated utility sector, like propane and home heating oil, as well as switching from natural gas, which is delivered by regulated utilities.
In the face of climate change, we need to make far more significant progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions—which necessitates taking down those obstacles. It’s not really a choice.
Fortunately, several leading states have come up with ways to fix this efficiency silo issue. As many of them embark on achieving ambitious new climate goals, they are designing new ways for their efficiency policies to reduce costs for families and businesses and aggressively cut carbon emissions. They are tackling the issue in two main ways: updating fuel-switching rules and establishing multiple energy goals, including fuel-neutral goals. Still, many states lag on modernizing their efficiency policies and can look to these leaders for examples.
States taking the lead: The switch is on
Some states are starting to change rules governing whether efficiency programs can encourage customers to switch from one fuel source to another, as we recently documented in a policy brief. We found that regulators and lawmakers in Alaska, California, Massachusetts, New York, Tennessee, and Vermont are encouraging fuel switching or fuel substitution through guidelines or fuel-neutral energy savings goals. Ideally, these policies align with clear, holistic cost-effectiveness rules that account for the full greenhouse gas (GHG) and fuel-savings benefits that fuel switching yields.
For example, last summer, California redefined the fuel substitution test for its energy efficiency programs to better align the criteria with current cost-effectiveness approaches and environmental goals. That change allows ratepayer funding to support customers who want to switch from gas to electric technologies when the criteria are met. (Note that definitions of “fuel switching” and “fuel substitution” vary by state in terms of which types of fuel they include.)
We also identified a handful of states that have supportive policies in place but have additional rules or guidance pending (Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Maine) and others that have no specific policy in place but where regulators have allowed utilities or other efficiency program administrators to support fuel switching in certain cases (Alabama, Delaware, D.C., Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin).
Other states are considering changes, too. For example, the Minnesota House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow efficiency programs to support efficient fuel-switching measures for participants, while also raising the overall electricity and gas savings that these programs must achieve. The state’s Senate, however, adjourned before taking action on the bill.
Transitioning energy savings goals beyond single-fuel silos
While state policies have long emphasized reducing energy use, they are increasingly focusing on reducing GHG emissions. That makes switching to electric heat pumps even more important (and not just for heating, as they provide efficient cooling, too). To do this, states are setting multiple energy savings goals—expressed not only in kilowatt-hours for electricity or therms for natural gas, but also in Btu or GHG. We documented this trend last year in our research report on “next generation” energy efficiency resource standards (EERS). Since then, we have seen continued progress.
For example, in January, the New York Public Service Commission issued a major new energy efficiency order calling for the state, through 2025, to save 3.6 TBtu of energy by installing heat pumps. The order also established nation-leading goals for electricity and gas savings (3% annual electricity savings and 1.3% annual gas savings goals by 2025). And we are seeing the impact: Con Edison recently announced a $1.5 billion initiative that triples its efficiency investments in 2025 and includes a focus on heat pump deployment.
And in February, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) made a policy change by adopting a GHG goal for all its energy efficiency programs.
Massachusetts, too, was an early leader. Nearly two years ago, it adopted a fuel-neutral energy efficiency policy goal expressed in Btu, a GHG goal, and sub-targets for heat pump deployment.
Leverage flexible funding sources and help customers get heat pump ready
Ratepayer efficiency funds are often challenging to deploy for heat pumps because they are bound by siloed efficiency policies. In the meantime, while savings goals and fuel switching policies are being redesigned, states can look to other, more flexible funding sources, such as cap-and-trade funding, to incentivize heat pumps.
For example, the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources is using Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) funds to incentivize households to switch to heat pumps and is looking more broadly to other strategies to decarbonize its heating sector. And the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) recently approved $200 million of cap-and-trade funds for heat pumps and all-electric new housing, with a focus on low-income households.
States should also look to their whole-house and building efficiency programs to help customers get “heat pump ready.” Improvements to a building shell, such as insulation and air sealing, can help reduce overall heating and cooling loads, which can help downsize the equipment needs—and therefore costs—for heat pumps. Energy efficiency and electrification have an important relationship and must work in concert to reduce customer costs.
States should look to their efficiency policies to do more
Other states can look to these leaders as they map out their own efforts to reform their rules governing efficiency investments in the buildings sector. And these policies just scratch the surface of the potential for electrification as a decarbonization strategy; the transportation sector and industrial sector opportunities are much larger.
Many states have made key progress for years on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through policies and programs incentivizing upgrades to more-efficient equipment. But even durable and successful efficiency policies need to be modernized to break their silos and enable far more aggressive reductions in energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

Transportation Bill Provisions Are a First Step for Enabling Lower-Carbon Transportation;"June 3, 2020
Washington, DC — A transportation bill released Wednesday by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), Chair of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, includes key provisions that would help steer some federal funding toward projects enabling lower-carbon transportation and better mobility. The INVEST in America Act would provide $494 billion in federal funding for transportation projects over five years.
“The federal government previously gave money to transportation projects with little consideration of their impact on the climate or on creating an efficient, resilient transportation system. This bill includes a new carbon reduction program that’s a good first step for steering funding toward more efficient, cleaner transportation. It holds states and metropolitan planning organizations accountable for the climate impacts of their transportation projects, incentivizing them to measure greenhouse gas impacts and prioritize efforts that have the greatest carbon reduction potential,” said Shruti Vaidyanathan, transportation program director at ACEEE.
“Of course, policymakers still have a long way to go to invest in a transportation network that dramatically reduces our greenhouse gas emissions at the rate needed while giving people better transportation options.”
The House bill follows a Senate bill, advanced through the Environment and Public Works Committee in July 2019, that contained several similar measures. Both bills include new funding for electric vehicle chargers, among other provisions that would help make transportation more efficient and cleaner.
“I hope it begins a dramatic shift in how we allocate our transportation funding. That’s what we need,” said Vaidyanathan. To strengthen the bill, she said, “We’d also like to see more attention to improving the efficiency of the freight sector, including through applications of innovative technology, dedicated funding for a robust multimodal system, and requirements for states to track and reduce carbon emissions.”

Industrial Energy Intensity Continued to Decrease in 2019;"U.S. industrial energy intensity—the energy use per dollar of industrial production—decreased by 2.5% in 2019, continuing a decades-long trend. The new data was published recently by the Energy Information Administration.
Industrial energy intensity has been cut by more than half since 1980, with advances interrupted by two recessions. Thus, even as industrial output (we use value added for this chart) has more than doubled, total industrial energy use in the United States (not shown below) is about the same as it was in 1980. But progress in reducing energy intensity in the sector has been less rapid since resuming in 2012.
Source: EIA April 2020 Monthly Energy Review; BEA Industry Data
Chemical plants account for almost half of today’s industrial energy use, with oil refineries, paper mills, and steel mills accounting for much of the rest. Overall energy intensity improvements are due to both efficiency improvements in specific industries and structural shifts in the economy, as less energy-intensive subsectors grow more rapidly. In recent years, most of the progress appears to be due to structural change as low natural gas prices have decreased the incentive for efficiency measures.
Decreased industrial output during recessions tends to lead to higher energy intensity, as production drops more than energy use. Thus, we expect that the partial shutdown of industry this year may again disrupt the trend to lower intensity.
In the longer term, we need much greater energy savings to achieve needed decarbonization of industry. In fact, ACEEE’s analysis of how energy efficiency measures alone can cut projected U.S. carbon emissions in half by 2050 includes sharply reducing current industrial energy intensity to get there. Clearly, we need to step up efforts.
More data and information about energy efficiency trends and impacts are available in the Energy Efficiency Impact Report released in December.

Industrial Decarbonization Is Essential for Addressing Climate Crisis, Report Shows;"With industry accounting for more than one-fourth of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, its decarbonization is essential for combating climate change, according to a report released today that shows energy efficiency is a key way to slash these industrial emissions.
Decarbonizing industry by midcentury will require a transformation in what we make and how we make it. Doing it right could not only reduce emissions, but also protect the United States’ 20 million (predominantly well-paying) industry jobs. As the report explains, we will need a multi-faceted approach that emphasizes energy efficiency but also includes electrification, low-carbon fuels, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).
This research, the first in a series of ACEEE reports on the topic, is part of ACEEE’s Decarbonize Industry Initiative. For more than a year, we have led a coalition to lay the groundwork for decarbonization (or carbon removal) by convening NGOs, labor, and industry stakeholders. We have identified priorities for policymakers, including longer-term research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) work and shorter-term stimulus measures, such as teams of experts to do energy audits of the 500 largest U.S. industrial facilities.
“We simply cannot fight climate change without reducing industrial emissions. That is why we are so committed to this issue,” says Neal Elliott, report co-author and ACEEE’s senior director of research. “Industry is a very complex sector of the U.S. economy, and its decarbonization will be challenging and complex as a result. But energy efficiency offers a clear path forward, and at the same time, it can also boost U.S. competitiveness, reduce costs, and create jobs.""
Our efforts reflect growing international interest. With 27 other organizations, we co-authored a new Applied Energy journal article on the technologies and policies needed to decarbonize industry worldwide, especially three top GHG emitting sectors: cement, iron and steel, and chemicals.
Industrial emissions are massive
Decarbonizing industry is particularly important, because emissions from U.S. industry are projected to grow more than those from any other end-use sector through 2050.
“A less emission-intense electricity grid is needed, but by itself, the grid will not sufficiently reduce industrial emissions,” says Andrew Whitlock, the report’s lead author and an ACEEE research analyst. He says we should focus on manufacturing, which accounts for the bulk of U.S. industrial emissions and has economy-wide impacts.
In the United States, industry — fueled mostly by petroleum and natural gas — accounts for 28% of all energy-related emissions. Globally, it accounts for slightly more (one-third) of GHG emissions, largely because developing economies such as India rely more on carbon-intensive cement for construction than the United States does.
Although U.S. manufacturing has dramatically reduced its energy and carbon intensity over the past three decades, big opportunities still lie ahead.
Energy efficiency should be a primary strategy. It can cut industrial emissions 15% today through relatively simple and inexpensive modifications to industrial buildings, equipment, and operations. We can start right away by focusing on strategic energy management, smart manufacturing, and efficient equipment including pumps, fans, and compressors. In the longer term, we can improve industrial processes that are now the subject of RD&D.
We can cut industrial emissions in other ways, too. Some processes can be electrified in the near term. We can generate energy onsite with renewable sources such as solar and wind or with combined heat and power technologies using waste and biofuels. For industrial processes that require high temperatures, we can use low-carbon energy sources such as hydrogen, and for those that are particularly difficult to decarbonize — such as iron smelting and lime calcination — we may need new technologies or CCUS to abate remaining emissions.
Supply chains will also be critical. All along a supply chain, greenhouse gases are emitted as goods are produced, distributed, used, reused, and disposed of. Because manufacturers are both consumers and producers, they have enormous potential to reduce GHG emissions if they shift to using low-carbon materials and creating more efficient products. Manufacturers and other companies can set emission reduction targets and use their purchasing power to drive demand for low-carbon materials and goods.
Decarbonization requires partnerships
“Industry and government must work together to create pathways for success. As technologies move from pilots to commercial scale, both public and private capital will be needed,” says Ed Rightor, report co-author and director of ACEEE’s Industrial Program. Without government support, he says, manufacturers may be hesitant to invest in large capital projects due to high upfront costs, long life spans of equipment, and concerns about risk.
The Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office, for example, can help. It can fund research on reducing carbon intensity in industrial processes and products, support pilot projects, and help address technical issues that arise during commercialization of new technologies. The federal government can also set energy efficiency standards for industrial equipment, set procurement standards for low-carbon products, and address potential regulatory hurdles.
We recommend U.S. policymakers take these steps:
Prioritize industrial decarbonization efforts by relevant federal agencies such as DOE, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Department of Defense, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Spur technological innovation and commercialization by increasing coordination and cost sharing among federal agencies, national labs, universities, and private industry.
Develop a strong workforce that develops and deploys new low-carbon technologies and processes.
Create a market for low-carbon technologies and goods through voluntary labeling programs, incentives, standardized tools, and market signals.
We need to accelerate industrial decarbonization now, unleashing American ingenuity as we fight climate change and build a prosperous, resilient future for everyone.

A Perfect Storm? COVID-19 Cuts Incomes And Hikes Home Energy Bills;"Before the COVID-19 crisis, one-third of American households faced difficulty affording their energy bills, some having to choose among key necessities such as food, medicine, and keeping the lights on. Now as they shelter in place and many lose their jobs and sources of income, we expect household energy costs to rise, adding another stressor to the current economic crisis. 
Our pre-COVID research found that about 30 million U.S. households experience high energy burdens. A household’s energy burden is the percentage of income spent on energy bills, and academics consider spending more than 6% of income on energy a high or unaffordable burden. High energy burdens hit low-income households particularly hard, and these burdens are associated with increased stress, negative health impacts, and cycles of poverty. Those with disproportionally high burdens include African American and Hispanic households, renters, older Americans, and those residing in affordable multifamily buildings.
These highly burdened communities are also the most affected by COVID-19­­­, which research has found disproportionally impacts communities of color, especially black communities. Researchers found that pre-existing conditions related to air pollution increase the risk of a COVID-19 death, and black communities are disproportionally impacted by polluting facilities. Therefore, some of those most impacted by COVID-19 may have already been struggling to pay energy bills, which may now become even more difficult to afford.
Incomes decrease as energy costs increase
It’s a perfect storm: Incomes are falling, and energy costs are rising. Already, 36 million Americans have applied for unemployment, more than half due to the pandemic. This impact hits as many people spend more time at home and their home energy and water bills increase.
In California, residential electric usage has increased 15–20% in recent weeks compared to the same period in 2019. As we move into the summer, electric bills will also rise for many because of the need for more air conditioning. The threat of extreme heat waves may create additional spikes in electric bills this summer.
Many states and utilities have suspended disconnections due to unpaid energy bills to ensure everyone has energy during the crisis. Some—but not all—have waived late fees. While shut-off moratoria keep the lights on in the short term, most states allow for energy bills to continue to accrue and don’t have plans in place to address growing customer debt. Bill assistance programs, including the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), help. But the programs don’t reach all who qualify, leaving millions of highly burdened households without support.
Long-term solutions to reduce energy bills should include efficiency
High energy bills for low-income families aren’t inevitable. They’re often the result of inadequate insulation, inefficient heating and cooling equipment, old appliances, and a host of other factors. In addition to short-term direct bill assistance, improving home efficiency through weatherization can reduce bills for highly burdened households. Homes improved by the federal Weatherization Assistance Program, for instance, save their occupants about $300 per year on energy bills and provide significant health benefits.
Energy efficiency investment is needed to reduce bills in the long term—including to mitigate economic pain in a potentially prolonged crisis.
Efficiency work delayed, and future work targeted
Unfortunately, COVID-19 has slowed or halted energy efficiency programs in many states, especially the programs serving low-income households that require contractors to enter homes to install weatherization measures. While this pause is necessary to maintain social distancing and protect the public health, it costs jobs, foregoes energy savings, and poses challenges to rebuilding capacity later.
Although energy efficiency work needs to resume when health conditions allow, some states are facing efforts to shift funds from energy efficiency to address COVID-19 needs. Consumer advocates broadly agree that utility customers should have access to weatherization and energy efficiency services alongside other needed protections, as stated in a new resolution by the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates.
Cutting back on investments that reduce future energy bills is shortsighted and unwise. Instead, we need to increase investments in both bill payment assistance and energy efficiency.
Strategies to sustain low-income energy efficiency programs
Low-income energy efficiency programs—funded largely through utility ratepayer dollars and the federal government—can prepare now for the challenges they will face when they restart and operate in the COVID-19 landscape.
Provide support now
Many utilities and implementers have started implementing virtual audits, which allow an energy professional to “walk through” a home over the phone or via the internet to identify potential energy saving measures. Some, such as Energy Outreach Colorado and DTE Energy, have also continued to operate programs that provide emergency heating system replacements when social distancing options are available. While these limited programs cannot replace the benefits of full weatherization, they give program implementers a way to continue supporting customers and contractors now.
While waiting to restart weatherization services, some implementers have switched to delivering energy-saving kits to customers. For example, Eversource Connecticut is sending a self-installation package—including education material, LED bulbs, and advanced power strips—to all customers participating in their virtual pre-assessment home walkthrough. Similarly, TVA has mailed customers its EnergyRight Energy Monsters kit, which provides energy-saving programming and activities for children and energy-saving tips for parents. Other program implementers are offering direct communication and support over the phone, where they provide information on saving energy and direct customers to additional resources.
Prepare for new health and safety needs
Many low-income program implementers are preparing to restart or have restarted program operations with additional personal protective equipment (PPE) and new health and safety strategies. The National Association for State Community Service Programs created a list of PPE suggestions for weatherization workers, including basic infection-prevention measures, changes in how crews operate, and health screening questions before home visits. Following Colorado’s Weatherization Assistance Program COVID-19 protocols, Energy Outreach Colorado recently restarted weatherization work in homes. These guidelines include new training and education on signs and symptoms of COVID-19, monitoring staff members for illness, screening clients for risk factors, and including new social distancing for workspaces and PPE requirements for job sites.
Create a pipeline of future participants
Virtual energy assessments create a pipeline of future program participants, which can help avoid lags once programs are able to restart. For example, JEA compiled a list of income-eligible customers with high energy use to reach out to with support during the Florida stay at home order. It offered virtual energy audits and signed customers up to be re-called for a future in-person appointment once safe to do so.
As COVID-19 leads to higher household energy burdens, energy efficiency continues to be a critical strategy to help households reduce their energy bills and improve long-term comfort and affordability. Low-income program implementers can adopt these strategies to sustain their programs in the short and long term as they prepare to continue work in an uncertain future.

S. David Freeman, an Early Efficiency Visionary, Passes On;"We learned yesterday that S. David Freeman, an energy-efficiency leader for nearly 50 years, died of a heart attack at age 94. Sometimes known as the “green cowboy” for the hat he always wore (and the title of his autobiography), at various points in his career he served as the head of several of America’s largest public utilities – the Tennessee Valley Authority, the New York Power Authority, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and the Lower Colorado River Authority.
In all of these organizations, energy efficiency efforts expanded substantially during his tenure.
  In a March 2018 interview with E&E (subscription needed), Freeman said his most important contribution to energy policy was a study he completed for the Ford Foundation in 1973-74 that promoted the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency. Freeman sent that report to the governors of every state. ""One of them was Jimmy Carter. He actually read the report, and it formed the foundation of his energy policy,"" Freeman said.
Freeman was known for speaking his mind. As he said on the back cover of his autobiography, “when you speak your mind, you can get bad people to do good things.” Freeman was twice a plenary speaker at the ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings and over the years was a friend to ACEEE in many other ways.
Further information on his colorful career and accomplishments is provided in yesterday’s Los Angeles Times story.

Fuel Economy Rollback Sets the U.S. Further Behind the Leaders;"The United States will fall well behind leading countries on passenger vehicle fuel economy, thanks to the Trump administration’s recent rollback of federal standards. The rollback, issued as a final rule in April, not only jeopardizes the competitiveness of the American auto industry in the global marketplace, but also threatens progress on reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
The rule calls for only a 1.5% increase per year in fuel efficiency for model year 2021-2026 vehicles, a major reduction compared to the almost 5% annual increase that was part of the Obama administration’s program. So instead of new U.S. cars hitting 55 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2026, their target will be 48 mpg — up from 44.8 mpg this year. These figures are based on laboratory testing; real-world mileage tends to be about 20% lower.
  Source: International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) 2020
Other countries have already surpassed the current U.S. target. China and South Korea have model year 2020 targets of 47.7 mpg and 56.6 mpg, respectively, while the European Union’s standard is 56.8 mpg for 2021 cars.  
Looking ahead, some of the gaps will widen. The E.U. and Japan have very ambitious targets in place for model year 2030 cars at 81 mpg and 71 mpg, respectively. India’s target for 2022 cars is 49 mpg, especially impressive considering that it finalized its first fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles in 2014.
Also worth noting – while Canada has traditionally followed the U.S. fuel economy program, it has made no commitment to accept the weakened standards. It will likely continue to aim for the previous 2025 target of 55 mpg, leaving the United States in the rear-view mirror.
As a result, American manufacturers may struggle. Both the E.U. and Japan are significant competitors to the United States for vehicle manufacturing and sales. Detroit will need to push out different versions of the same vehicle for different markets, an expensive endeavor. European, Japanese, and South Korean vehicles destined for the U.S. market, in contrast, will already meet their respective country’s efficiency targets and may prove to be more attractive to many drivers in the United States.

Healthy Homes for All: the Untapped Power of Energy Efficiency Programs;"Just stay home. It’s the most important thing that many of us can do during the COVID-19 pandemic—for our own safety and for public health. For those fortunate enough to have safe, comfortable, healthy homes, this quarantine may be manageable. Millions of Americans, however, live in homes that are uncomfortable or even unsafe.
Home energy efficiency and healthy-home improvements are usually treated separately. However, according to an ACEEE report released today, nearly $3 billion can be saved by using existing energy efficiency programs to tackle a small group of health harms: fatal falls, asthma attacks, and exposures to extreme heat and cold.
This integrated approach saves money and lives: more than $2 billion over the next decade by avoiding falls and more than half a billion dollars from improved asthma outcomes. The report offers new tools for calculating these benefits.
Lead author Sara Hayes says: “Insulation and air sealing save energy, but they also protect people from heat waves and other harmful effects of climate change. Combining these services with strategies to identify and address a person’s asthma triggers — such as pest management and removal of indoor irritants — can reduce asthma symptoms and even prevent hospital visits. Our estimates are conservative because once we start thinking of energy programs as health programs, there is huge potential to save lives and improve quality of life by targeting services to the millions of people who struggle with these health risks.”
Every year, electric and natural gas utilities invest billions of dollars into a large nationwide network of energy efficiency programs. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), the largest residential whole-house energy efficiency program in the country, is working to improve some of the most inefficient homes by offering air sealing, insulation, and upgrades to HVAC units, all of which can improve indoor air quality and thermal comfort. WAP workers may also install smoke and CO detectors, fix faulty heating and combustion systems, and identify mold and moisture hazards, measures that can protect health and save lives.
At the same time, the Affordable Care Act’s emphasis on preventive approaches to health care creates opportunities for this existing network of energy efficiency programs to increase health benefits for participants and expand programs and services with new sources of funding. Translating these health benefits into avoided health costs can create an evidence base for linking energy-saving programs with health outcomes, information that can be used to make a compelling case for partnership and funding to hospitals, insurers, and other health care providers. So far, energy programs have been missing this opportunity (stay tuned for more on this in ACEEE’s forthcoming report on braiding funding for health and energy savings programs).
“It’s really important to quantify and monetize the impacts we see from comprehensive energy and health programs. This type of data will empower decision makers in both sectors to prioritize financial investments where we can have the biggest impact,” says Hayes.
In the past, it has been difficult to produce monetized estimates of the health benefits that energy-efficiency programs can create for participants and society at large. ACEEE’s new tools can be used to calculate the financial savings these interventions can produce. If weatherization programs added a few more interventions that focus on four common health risks — asthma, falls, and exposure to extreme heat and cold — they could substantially increase their positive health impacts.
“Our numbers show only a fraction of what is possible,” Hayes emphasizes, “Households participating in energy programs stand to realize some major health benefits; the sooner energy programs recognize this, the better.”
“The COVID-19 pandemic has put homes at the center of our national conversation, highlighting the disproportionate health and housing burdens faced by some communities.There is significant potential to impact health and reduce energy burdens by combining energy-efficiency and healthy-home improvements. By combining resources from the health and energy sectors, programs can be positioned to receive expanded funding for vulnerable populations, enabling them to provide more services and reach more households.”

2019 Electricity Sales Continue Decade-Long Flat Trend;"U.S. electricity sales last year were similar to 2017, indicating the significantly higher 2018 sales were an anomaly. The Energy Information Administration, which recently released these data, attributes the 2018 jump largely to colder winters and a hot summer. These data predate COVID-19, and we expect a drop in 2020 electricity sales when new data are released at this time next year.

The 2019 data continue a trend of essentially flat electricity use since 2007, even while the economy and population have grown significantly. This stretch is in marked contrast to the 1980–2006 period, when electricity use grew substantially, first paralleling economic growth before falling below it.
The change between these periods is because of many factors, but previous ACEEE analysis finds that increasing energy efficiency is a major contributor, allowing more work to be done with less energy. The rapid shift to more-efficient lighting in homes and commercial buildings has been a key factor, and more-efficient air conditioners and electronics have helped as well. Policies, including updated appliance and equipment standards, utility energy efficiency programs, and strengthened building energy codes, all played a role.
More data and information about energy efficiency impacts are available in the Energy Efficiency Impact Report released in December.

U.S. Per-capita Energy Use Almost Flat for a Decade;"In promising news that highlights efficiency gains, U.S. per-capita energy use declined modestly last year, according to 2019 data recently released by the Energy Information Administration, reversing an uptick in 2018. This data precedes the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect a more significant drop when 2020 data is released at this time next year.
The figure below shows how population has increased steadily over the past 40 years, while total U.S. energy use has barely changed since 2000. Per-capita energy use declined 13% from 2000 to 2009, and has held steady since then. These figures are not adjusted for weather and economic growth, which are factors in variations from year to year.
 Source: All data from EIA March 2020 Monthly Energy Review except 2019 population, which comes from the U.S. Census Bureau.
We also looked at energy consumption patterns in the residential and commercial sectors. In the residential sector, consumption (shown by the blue line below) trended upward until 2010 but has been level or a bit lower since then. As a result, consumption per household (the red line) has generally declined since 2000. Efficiency improvements to homes and home appliances have contributed greatly to this trend.

What the COVID Crisis Can Teach Us on Earth Day;"While the world is necessarily focused on COVID-19 and our worsening economy, these crises provide lessons and insights for future work to address the looming crisis of climate change that are worth discussing as we approach Earth Day tomorrow. The first Earth Day happened 50 years ago. Much has been accomplished since 1970 in terms of making our air and water cleaner while keeping our energy use in check. However, the climate crisis shows that our work ahead is much larger still. The COVID-19 pandemic offers clues on how we can rebuild our economy and also address climate change.
First, the global response to COVID-19 shows that when the world is faced with a crisis, it can act. While our actions have been imperfect, they have nonetheless “flattened the curve” in many places and almost certainly saved millions of lives. Many governments and people have reacted with extraordinary measures and uncharacteristic speed. Yes, the changes were so quick and necessarily aggressive that they came with significant economic cost. As we think about how best to respond to the global climate crisis, we hope we can incorporate some of the positive examples of collective action and rapid response we marshalled for COVID-19 while taking care to avoid large economic dislocations.
Second, COVID-19 is so bad in part because we ignored the warning signs from SARS, MERS, and Ebola and were woefully unprepared. If we had planned to address pandemics as the World Bank and others had urged (e.g., see here), COVID-19 would still be bad, but not nearly so destructive. We have also seen the warning signs for climate change. As with pandemics, it’s best to plan and invest to avert the worst-case scenarios.
Third, the virus illustrates that while local and state action are essential, we need a coordinated national and international response to a global crisis. Local, state, and national governments and international organizations have all been vital parts of the COVID-19 response, and there have been some notable examples of coordination, such as among medical researchers around the world. But sometimes lack of coordination has led to inefficient distribution of critical supplies, failure to adopt best practices, and preventable spread of the virus. Slashing global greenhouse gas emissions will similarly require concerted global action. As we address climate change, we can learn from the best of state, regional, national, and international efforts to address COVID-19.
Fourth, in addition to containing sickness and reducing deaths, our actions in response to COVID-19 have cleared the air (e.g., India’s air is cleaner than it has been for many years), unclogged our streets, and reduced power demand. To be clear, this current shutdown is neither a climate solution nor a guide to one. We want our economy to bounce back, and as it does, emissions and traffic will increase. But there are things we can do to keep energy needs, congestion, and pollution – including carbon – from totally rebounding as we emerge from the crisis. For example, COVID-19 has changed the way we live, including telework, teleschool, and telemedicine. Perhaps we can continue some of these practices some of the time. Further, reducing pollution could make the next pandemic less deadly. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have found that communities with lower levels of fine particulate pollution have lower death rates from COVID-19.
Finally, as we continue to address the current COVID-19 and economic crises, there are things we can do to also address climate change. For the immediate health crisis, we need to continue to shelter in place while building up testing and contact tracing so that any new outbreaks can be quickly tamped down. When it is time to open our economy, economic stimulus will be needed, likely on a larger scale than was employed during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. Such efforts should favor clean parts of our economy over dirty parts. And our efforts need to extend beyond the short-term (next year or two) to the medium-term (to about 2025) and longer-terms (to 2030 and beyond) as well.
Several successful programs from the Great Recession a decade ago show the way, such as successful efforts to weatherize about a million low-income homes and tripled tax credits to spur sales of efficient equipment and services. We can learn from past mistakes, too. While the weatherization efforts were successful, many of the workers hired and trained were laid off as funds were spent. This time we should establish longer-term programs to continue providing weatherization services to low- and moderate-income households so that jobs can be retained and more households can benefit. Similarly, a set of stimulus actions now could aid retooling of industrial plants to provide long-term jobs while reducing energy use and emissions and expanding infrastructure for and sales of electric vehicles.
This year, as ACEEE marks its 40th anniversary, we have issued a Call to Action to scale up energy efficiency to combat climate change and build a clean energy future that benefits everyone. While the COVID-19 pandemic has caused people and the economy a lot of pain, it has also forced us to take urgent, bold action. Let us learn from that action so we can avoid the worst long-term impacts of the climate crisis.

U.S. Energy Use Held Steady for 15-plus Years;"U.S. energy consumption has barely changed over the past 15 years despite significant economic growth that preceded the COVID-19 pandemic, according to 2019 data released recently by the Energy Information Administration.
Energy use has fluctuated only modestly from year to year, as shown by the orange line in the graphic below, while the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has increased 32% since 2004 (in inflation-adjusted dollars). Energy consumption was about 100 quadrillion Btu (quads) in 2019, almost identical to 2004. It declined during the Great Recession, rebounded in recent years, but will likely fall this year because of COVID-19 and the resulting economic crisis.
    Total U.S. energy use declined by 1% in 2019, partially reversing a significant increase in 2018. The energy savings were spread across every economic sector (homes, commercial buildings, industry, and transportation), but were mostly in electricity produced by coal, along with a small decline in oil use for transportation.
The graphic also shows that if energy use had grown as rapidly as GDP since 1980, it would have been about 220 quads last year. Based on studies looking at the different factors involved (summarized here), we estimate that energy efficiency accounts for about 60% of the difference between the 100 quads of actual consumption and 220 quads if past patterns had continued. Structural changes, such as shifts toward a more service-oriented economy account for the other 40%.
In other words, energy efficiency over the past three decades is reducing energy use by about 70 quads each year (and growing) – a gigantic achievement. To put this in perspective, this is about the same as the combined annual energy use of Japan, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom.
Many other pieces of data and information about energy efficiency impacts are available in the Energy Efficiency Impact Report we co-published in December.

States, Cities Get Big Opportunity to Cut Carbon Emissions With New Building Code;"A new model building code – all but finalized this week – gives U.S. states and cities a great chance to save money and cut pollution by reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from buildings.
Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of U.S. energy consumption and GHG emissions. States and cities that adopt the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) will effectively require new buildings to reduce covered energy use by more than 10% on average compared to buildings meeting the previous code, and by more than a third compared to the 2009 IECC.
The stakeholder vote that enabled the new code was validated Wednesday by the board of the International Code Council, which developed the code.
More than 2000 state and city officials from 641 jurisdictions across the country participated in the process. They voted late last year in support of a series of proposals to strengthen energy efficiency requirements in the code. Voter turnout roughly doubled compared to three years earlier, reflecting an increased interest in strengthening building codes to reduce energy costs and address climate change.
Officials supported key updates to the code by strong margins, including provisions requiring high-efficiency water heating (68% support); electric circuits to allow future conversions to highly-efficient electrified equipment (74%); pre-wiring buildings to be ready for the installation of electric vehicle charging stations (71% for residential buildings and 82% for commercial buildings); a flexible energy savings provision that allows developers to choose different energy efficiency measures to achieve energy savings in homes (74%); and an optional zero energy appendix that provides a pathway for cities and states to construct ultra-energy efficient homes that meet their remaining energy needs with renewable energy (82%).
One word of caution. Opponents of stronger building codes have already attempted to overturn the votes, unsuccessfully. There is one final chance for them to challenge the results via a 30-day appeals window that has now begun. However, an independent audit has already validated the voters and voting process. A bigger threat may be that the International Code Council considers changes to the process that make it even harder to achieve savings in future code cycles.
We applaud local and state code officials from around the country for voting in support of energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. We worked with mayors, sustainability directors, and others to propose amendments and educate voters. After several model code updates over the last decade that only minimally advanced efficiency, this new code is a big step forward, and we hope it will get us back on track to steadily stronger codes, and eventually to zero energy buildings.
But a model code, of course, only matters if states and cities use it. Many of them have set major greenhouse gas reduction targets in recent years. The new code, which is on track to be published this fall and then ready for adoption, gives them a bold opportunity to achieve part of those targets.
The buildings we construct today will be around for decades, even generations, to come. Every day a municipality or a state waits on adopting the new code means less efficient buildings continue to be built – locking in more greenhouse gas emissions.
Officials from across the country helped to make this code tackle the challenge of inefficient new buildings. Let’s not wait to seize the opportunity they’ve given us.

COVID-19 Sparks Relief Efforts From the Efficiency Industry;"Washington, DC — The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all of us, hurting some much more than others. In a sliver of good news, utilities, private companies, and other groups are reaching out to help. We found stories of our Allies donating money, delivering groceries, offering virtual energy assessments, launching diagnostic tests, providing medical equipment, and working 24/7 to keep the power on.
As required in some states, many utilities have pledged not to shut off service to those unable to pay their utility bills. Some are going further: Pacific Gas & Electric is waiving security deposits and implementing flexible payment options. Southern California Edison is offering payment assistance options, including extensions, and National Grid is suspending rate increases for three months in upstate New York.
 ""The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the communities we serve is unprecedented and creates a degree of economic uncertainty in the weeks and months ahead,"" said Jeff Lyash, president of the Tennessee Valley Authority. He announced that TVA will give local power companies the regulatory flexibility to halt disconnection of service and grant them access to $1 billion in credit to help address urgent community and customer needs.
Connecting with customers
Some utilities are offering no-cost virtual home energy assessments. MassSave, a collaborative of Massachusetts utilities and energy efficiency providers, said customers can participate in a live virtual discussion with an energy specialist and receive a custom report on how their homes can save energy and money.
“One of the highlights we’re offering customers is that we will pay 100% of the cost of insulation,” said Penni Conner, vice president and chief customer officer of Eversource Energy, a utility that is also contributing to food pantries and donating more than $2 million to nonprofit social service groups including United Way.
Others are connecting directly with customers as well. Chicago-based Elevate Energy, which designs and implements clean energy programs, has delivered groceries to older customers who do not have family or friends nearby and partnered with affordable housing groups to provide emergency loans to renters. It’s also helped set up bridge funds and working capital loans for diverse contractors so they can pay their staff and stabilize their businesses.
""Elevate Energy believes in, and is implementing, solutions that will prevent small businesses from collapsing due to a situation that is outside their control,"" Delmar Gillus, the company’s chief operating office, told ACEEE.
Offering medical help
Companies are tapping their expertise to provide COVID-19 diagnostic tests and medical facilities. Bosch announced that it will launch a test this month that will deliver results onsite in 2.5 hours rather than a day or two. Developed by Bosch Healthcare Solutions in less than six weeks, the test involves simply swabbing a patient’s nose or throat. It will allow infected individuals to be isolated immediately.
Schneider Electric is partnering with Faith Technologies, HGA, and Boldt Construction to build modular hospital pods to treat respiratory illness. The pods would be positioned in temporary medical facilities such as outdoor fields and stadium clinics. Schneider’s Secured Power Group has designed an enclosed medical tent for healthcare professionals and a “surge” drive-through testing tent that would utilize digital power and equipment. In addition, the company is in discussion with the LA County Health Department to place a 52-Kwh microgrid at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, formerly a tuberculosis hospital with negative pressure isolation rooms that make it a promising site for COVID-19 patients. 
Donating money and goods
Many companies are opening their wallets. Google announced an $800 million-plus commitment to support small- and medium-sized businesses as well as health organizations and workers. It’s providing Google ad grants to the World Health Organization and more than 100 government agencies globally to help them provide critical information on preventing the spread of COVID-19. Google has also committed to a $200 million investment fund to help small businesses access capital.
Lockheed Martin is also propping up businesses. The company said it will advance more than $50 million to small- and medium-sized business partners in its supply chains so they can continue to operate and sustain jobs during the pandemic. It will also donate the use of its corporate aircraft and vehicles for COVID-19 logistical support and medical supply deliveries.
Samsung is donating both money and electronics. It reported donating $29 million worth of funds and goods to help governments and communities with their relief efforts, including the purchase of hygiene kits containing face masks. It is donating smartphones to patients in quarantine to help them keep in touch with families and friends, air purifiers and other appliances to hospitals and quarantine centers, and tablets to schools so children can learn outside of the classroom.
Tapping technology 
Other technology companies are taking broad approaches. Intel announced it has donated $10 million to support local communities and to buy gloves, masks, and other equipment for healthcare workers. It also pledged up to another $10 million to support innovative projects such as virtual intensive care unit beds and a new respirator, as well as $50 million to provide online learning services and to accelerate diagnostic and vaccine efforts.
The pandemic has prompted a supercomputing push, essential to give COVID-19 researchers the data they need to understand and fight the pandemic. This has led to the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium, a private-public effort spearheaded by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the U.S. Department of Energy, and IBM. Leaders from federal agencies, national laboratories, industry, and academia are volunteering their computing time on world-class machines. The consortium will review proposals from researchers and provide computing resources for projects that offer the greatest and most immediate public health benefits.

Report Shows Building Energy Use in Cities Is Declining: Q&A With Author Stefen Samarripas;"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. cities were reducing building energy use, and at least two factors contributed to that change: the age of a city’s housing stock and the relative size of its low-income population, according to an ACEEE report released today that should help guide local policy decisions.
The report explores several factors that can influence building energy use, curtail greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and combat climate change. The results clearly point to ways local governments can reduce building energy use and emissions. Still, because many municipalities do not report detailed, comparable, annual policy data, the study could not account for all energy-saving or climate mitigation actions taken by local governments. 
To learn more, we talked to Stefen Samarripas, lead author and ACEEE senior research analyst. He analyzed 2013–2016 data, finding that per capita building electricity use in U.S. cities fell at an annual rate of 1% — faster than the national average — and that per capita natural gas use declined 4% annually.
1. How have local government actions contributed to declines in building energy use?
We discovered that per capita energy use and GHG emissions decline as the share of a population with low incomes and the share of households living in older homes decline. Both factors can be heavily influenced by local government decisions, and both are associated with substantial declines in energy use and GHG emissions. We found that local governments have an opportunity to reduce per capita energy use by increasing the pace of energy-efficient housing construction projects while designing and implementing carefully targeted initiatives that improve access to energy-efficient affordable housing for low-income households.
2. How are GHG emissions and the share of people living in older homes related to one another?
Older homes that were constructed before the advent of energy efficiency standards or when less-efficient codes were in place tend to use more energy, and that can lead to more GHG emissions. Older homes may also use more energy because they’ve experienced more wear and tear over the years.
However, this doesn’t have to be the case. Older homes that have been well maintained or have undergone retrofits can be just as efficient as new homes, but the reality is that a relatively small share of older homes have been kept up or improved. Cities have an opportunity to reduce per capita energy use and GHG emissions by increasing the construction of new efficient homes and increasing the pace of home renovation projects that improve energy efficiency. Cities can do this by mandating or incentivizing stringent energy efficiency standards for housing construction projects, streamlining the permit and inspection process, and amending zoning codes to allow for the construction of more housing units.
3. What’s behind your finding that reduced energy consumption across cities is related to fewer low-income households? What does this indicate about the low-income housing stock and energy use?
Many low-income households are finding it extremely challenging to find affordable housing. To keep their housing costs manageable, many are occupying homes that are often not well maintained and have older appliances, leading to higher energy consumption and bills. These households typically don’t have the resources to make efficiency improvements. Many are also renters and can’t make changes without their landlord’s permission. Recent data also indicate that the average size of a low-income home is increasing, leading to a larger energy and carbon footprint. While we don’t know the exact causes of this shift, it could be that many of the single-family homes that went through foreclosure during the Great Recession are now being rented to low-income households.
These are all possible explanations for why per capita energy use is higher in places where low-income people make up a larger share of the total population. Cities have seen an increase in middle- and high-income households in recent years, and this has been accompanied by declining per capita energy use. It’s possible that increases in economic mobility in cities are leading to higher incomes and to shrinking low-income populations, but we should recognize that these shifts could also be due to the displacement of low-income households from unaffordable city neighborhoods. In our report, we explore how local government leaders are using low-income efficiency initiatives to weaken the relationship between income and per capita energy use, improve overall housing affordability, and contribute to economic mobility.
4. What are the implications of your report for local governments? Do your results offer any lessons for cities wanting to reduce their GHG emissions?
I would say that, above all, our research shows that it is possible for cities to play a positive role in reducing both per capita energy use and GHG emissions, and to do so in a way that largely benefits current and future residents.
Take the example of Minneapolis. The city has seen declines in both per capita energy use and GHG emissions, a substantial number of people moving into newly constructed energy-efficient homes, and a declining number of people with low incomes. These changes may have happened because the city’s housing has been relatively more affordable than in other cities. Compared to a city like Los Angeles, you see substantially more Minneapolis residents moving from older to newer housing, indicating that this trend is indeed possible. Compared to other cities, Minneapolis has had fewer low-income households displaced from economically improving neighborhoods, indicating that the city’s shrinking low-income population is due to other factors. Prior research points to intergenerational economic mobility — how income grows from one generation to the next — as a possible reason for this decline. Compared to children born in many other cities, a child born to a low-income Minneapolis family in the mid-1980s is more likely to be part of a middle- or even high-income household today.
The Minneapolis city government is taking steps to continue these trends. The city has long had an affordable housing trust fund, it is prioritizing investments in low-income energy efficiency, and it is encouraging the creation of more residential housing through the removal of single-family zoning.
5. Some people have argued that the idea of cities leading on climate is a myth. What do you think? Does your paper show otherwise?
It is very unlikely that city actions are having no effect on local GHG emissions. Previous research has already supported this finding, and our study adds even more evidence. Numerous studies document the strong role that cities have played in determining their citizens’ housing options and economic mobility, two factors our research identified as linked to per capita energy use and emissions. It is difficult for any study, including this one, to establish causation, and data limitations may mean that we can only partially explain how city actions relate to energy use and GHG emissions, but that doesn’t mean policymakers should assume there is no relationship. For example, the fact that the share of households living in older homes is linked to per capita energy use could very well be due to the adoption of robust local building energy codes, but we don’t have detailed data regarding these actions. It’s also possible that policies such as building energy benchmarking and building performance standards would stand out in a model like ours if more cities were to adopt such standards and rigorously track their implementation annually in ways that are comparable across cities.
6. You point to challenges around data quality and availability. How did those affect the outcomes of your research?
We faced some major data limitations, and this affected the conclusions we could draw from the analysis. While we designed our model to account for data limitations, this is one possible reason why some variables may not have stood out in our results.
Most cities aren’t reporting annual data on community-wide energy use or GHG emissions. Many are also not reporting these data in a way that is comparable across cities or across years. We had to limit the size of city samples because annual comparable data were often unavailable for cities, reducing our models’ ability to fully explain changes in per capita energy use.
We were also hindered by a lack of data reflecting specific climate mitigation or energy-saving initiatives, especially those focused on commercial and industrial properties. Many cities aren’t tracking the implementation or outcomes of their policies and programs in a rigorous or standardized way.
7. What types of data do cities need to ensure they are implementing effective policies?
There are two very important things that cities can do. First, we realize that many cities may not have the capacity to conduct complete GHG emissions inventories on an annual basis. However, if they are already working with local utility companies to gather community-wide building energy data for those inventories, they should request that utilities provide those data annually. This would allow both cities and researchers to closely track building energy use more frequently. Cities should also request that these data be provided for three separate sectors: residential, commercial, and industrial.
Second, cities should work together to negotiate a standardized approach to tracking the implementation and outcomes of common energy-saving policies and programs like building benchmarking and transparency initiatives and green-building incentive programs. They should then track those data on an annual basis.

Rollback of Fuel Efficiency Standards Will Harm U.S. Economy and Public Health for Years;"Washington, DC — The Trump administration’s rollback of clean car standards, announced Tuesday, will increase air pollution and hurt our health and the environment for years to come.
“At a time when the nation is focused on the COVID-19 emergency, this is a completely unnecessary and destructive action that will cost Americans at the pump and in the air we breathe,” said ACEEE executive director Steven Nadel. “Any longer-term policies adopted now should help secure the future health of our economy and environment. This rollback does the opposite.”
The final rule rolls back clean car standards slated for model year 2021-2026 vehicles. By hitting the brakes on corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas emissions standards, the administration will cause the owner of an average model year 2025 vehicle to fill up the gas tank 62 more times over the life of the vehicle.
With Saudi Arabia and Russia locked in an oil price war and Americans sharply curtailing their driving as they heed calls to stay home, spending on gasoline has dropped for now. But the rollback of standards will increase fuel consumption and emissions for decades to come.
“This is a major setback in addressing climate change, and that’s something we can’t afford,” said ACEEE senior fellow Therese Langer. “It’s also going to hurt the competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry when the nation and the world recover from the current crisis.”
As expected, the administration is calling for a 1.5% nominal annual increase in fuel efficiency — far less than the 5% annual increase that was slated to take effect.
ACEEE estimates that the administration’s action will add at least 131 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to our air annually by 2035 and increase U.S. fuel consumption by 11.7 billion gallons per year. That is the equivalent of adding nearly 29 million cars to our roads.
The new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Transportation (DOT) flies in the face of science, years of technical analysis by the agencies’ own experts — and common sense. In addition to saving Americans money at the pump, creating jobs, and protecting our health and the environment, vehicle efficiency standards boost the competitiveness of the domestic auto industry in a global market moving toward lower-emitting vehicles.
The rollback of federal standards follows the administration’s revocation last fall of EPA’s Clean Air Act waiver allowing California and 13 other states to maintain stronger standards. At the same time, DOT asserted that CAFE standards preempt those state programs. States have already challenged those earlier actions in court, and more lawsuits are expected to follow now that the rule is finalized.

“Our Work Is Now At A Standstill”: How COVID-19 Is Taking Efficiency Workers Off The Job;"At least 2.4 million Americans work in energy efficiency, from construction to manufacturing, wholesale trade to professional and business services. Some of these workers can stay on the job even during social distancing and lockdowns, including those able to work from home. Many cannot.
As of Monday, at least 19 states have halted all retrofits to low-income homes under the federal Weatherization Assistance Program. In the others, most of the local nonprofit agencies that implement the program have paused work, according to the National Association for State Community Services Programs.
The Building Performance Association, which represents 9,500 home and building performance contractors, says that virtually all residential energy efficiency work has been suspended by utilities, states, service providers, and small businesses.
When energy efficiency improvements in a home are delayed, a family keeps paying energy bills that are higher than necessary. And reductions in greenhouse gas emissions due to that home are also delayed.
But right now, the pandemic’s impact on energy efficiency is most severe and immediate for the workforce and businesses. We asked three veterans in the field how their work has been affected.
  Don Watts 
Watts Working Group, LLC Cleveland, Ohio 
“My work is inspecting homes to identify energy efficiency fixes that cut people’s bills and make them more comfortable. Here in Cuyahoga County, several dozen contractors work through the federal weatherization program and our utility to inspect residences and install energy efficiency improvements. Together our trained workforce provides energy conservation services to 1500–1800 houses and residential buildings annually.
All of our work is now at a standstill due to COVID-19. The only exceptions are situations of no heat or other emergencies.
Ohio is under a stay-at-home order, which is expected to be extended indefinitely. I think we all understand why this needs to happen. We’re all in this together. As for me, I anticipate starting a temporary warehouse position with Amazon next week until getting back to my profession.
The primary purpose of our work is energy conservation, but there is an equally important mission of health and safety delivery as well. As inspectors, we’re checking for carbon monoxide, unsafe electrical systems, and other hazards. We have a whole-house approach to leave a home safe. Now, we’re leaving a vast vulnerable population even more vulnerable.”
  Jill Motta 
President, Triple H Insulation, Heating & Cooling, St. James, NY
“Triple H is a woman-owned contracting business that specializes in making homes more comfortable and energy efficient. We’ve been operating on Long Island since 1999.
Before the governor’s mandate that all non-essential businesses keep their workforces home, we were thriving and had a two-month backlog of projects.
One day we were busy on the job and the next, our work came to a halt. I had to make the painful decision to furlough most of our staff. That meant 21 installers, crew leads, and project managers filing for unemployment benefits.
I kept a staff of five to continue our marketing efforts and to set sales appointments for when social distancing is a thing of the past. We have to be ready to get back in the field, because accounts receivables will dry up soon. 
I learned Friday that the Cares Act was passed and is offering loans to small businesses. I will apply and get the company through this. I’m hopeful for the future, especially if we can begin working again in a few weeks. If not, it will be a struggle. My family, employees, and I are healthy, and that’s the most important thing right now.”
  David Hepinstall 
Executive Director, Association for Energy Affordability, Inc., Bronx, NY
“AEA provides energy efficiency services and workforce training, with an emphasis on multifamily affordable housing. More than 90% of our revenue is based on energy efficiency work completed and energy savings achieved in homes and residential buildings.
We’re a direct services and training provider under New York state’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), an implementer and subcontractor for utility efficiency programs, and an energy consultant for new and existing multifamily properties participating in NYSERDA programs or needing to comply with New York City mandates. We are also a network of 12 nonprofit WAP subgrantees in downstate New York.
During this public health crisis, our in-building work has stopped completely, sharply reducing our income. We strongly support the need to halt residential efficiency operations at this time. Our WAP service territory in the Bronx and Queens includes communities hit particularly hard by the pandemic.
Our challenge is to retain our energy efficiency workers, some of whom are public housing residents, and the subcontractors we hire and manage. We cannot afford to lose our trained, qualified workers during this period. Our state has mounted an ambitious initiative to reduce carbon emissions. AEA must retain – even expand – its experienced workforce. We need support from public and private partners to do so while maintaining an effective social distancing strategy.”

States Step Up Climate Efforts By Requiring Utilities To Increase Energy Efficiency;"Before the COVID-19 pandemic adjourned state legislative sessions, several states took significant climate action this year by leaning on local utilities to ramp up programs that help customers save energy. Their tool of choice? The energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), a policy that requires utilities or statewide administrators to hit long-term energy savings targets by ramping up energy efficiency programs for homes and businesses.
This month, Virginia became the first state in the South to enact an EERS in a decade. New York became the second state in the nation after Massachusetts to set an EERS designed to encourage all forms of building decarbonization, including electrifying major building equipment. New Jersey and Washington, D.C. are also taking critical steps to implement recent EERS legislation as a key part of their climate efforts, and Maryland, Illinois, and Minnesota are considering legislation to expand their existing EERSs.
Energy efficiency: A cornerstone climate effort
State and city efforts to reach Paris Agreement climate targets will require major contributions from energy efficiency to cut greenhouse gas emissions equitably, cost-effectively, and reliably. And states are recognizing this. Many of the states that took action in 2019 toward making their electricity sectors carbon free by 2045–2050, such as California, Colorado, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, have a significant EERS in place to ensure that utilities are pulling their weight.
Already this year, several states have either created new efficiency policies or strengthened existing ones: 
Virginia: This month, both chambers of Virginia’s legislature passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which establishes an EERS for investor-owned utilities in the state. That’s a key part of the bill’s effort to reach 100% clean energy by 2050. Governor Ralph Northam is expected to sign the bill soon.
The EERS requires that in 2025, Dominion must save electricity equivalent to at least 5% (relative to 2019 sales) via efficiency measures implemented that year plus ongoing savings from measures implemented in previous years that are still saving energy. Appalachian Power Company must hit 2%. These are total electricity savings targets in 2025. We estimate that the utilities’ incremental annual savings targets will be about 1.2% per year, making it the 15th strongest one in place among the 27 states with an EERS (see map below). We estimate that the EERS alone will avoid more than 7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions over four years and would continue to reduce emissions as measures continue to save energy.
The bill also sets up a process to strengthen the EERS after 2025. After that year, the State Corporation Commission will adjust energy efficiency targets every three years. Importantly, utilities will have to prove they are hitting those targets before they are permitted to build new fossil fuel plants.
Of course, there’s a lot of implementation work to do to hold utilities accountable to the targets. And while the standard is not as high as leading states saving electricity at 2% per year, it sets Virginia on a strong path.
New York: In January, New York’s public service commission promulgated rules to implement their energy efficiency target, issuing an order setting ambitious energy efficiency and building decarbonization goals. This order moved forward a portion of the state’s New Efficiency: New York efforts to scale efficiency to meet its 40% reduction by 2030 climate goals as recently codified in the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. New York is pairing these utility customer offerings with building codes and appliance standards, government lead-by-example programs, weatherization programs, and market transformation efforts. The approved programs are projected to save more than 35 TBtu of energy through 2025, and alongside the other parts of New Efficiency: New York aims to deliver nearly one-third of its initial greenhouse gas emissions goal of a 40% reduction by 2030.
Importantly, this is one of the first states implementing a “next-generation EERS” which encourages utilities to use a broader set of resources, including beneficial electrification, to cut greenhouse gas emissions. New York’s approach is a fuel-neutral target measured in Btus. In addition, New York set separate targets within the broader fuel-neutral portfolio for efficiency savings by 2025 of 3% for electricity and 1.3% for gas. New York further committed to implementation of building decarbonization with a specific goal to deliver 3.6 TBTu of savings from heat pumps, a key technology for efficient space and water heating. Regulators also directed their use as an important alternative to be considered in natural gas supply-constrained areas.
New Jersey: The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) recently advanced efforts to implement an EERS mandated under the state’s ambitious Clean Energy Act of 2018. The BPU’s staff released a Straw Proposal for New Jersey’s Energy Efficiency and Peak Demand Reduction Programs, outlining potential policy decisions on program administration, cost recovery models, utility targets, and evaluation.
The straw proposal creates a system of accountability and rules of the road to meet the state’s EERS targets, shifting much of the responsibility from the state to utilities. Staff has requested comments by April 13th, and the BPU will finalize those rules so that utilities can submit their plans for regulatory approval this year.
In parallel, Governor Phil Murphy published an ambitious statewide and economy-wide Energy Master Plan (EMP) laying out a pathway to 100% clean energy by 2050. That plan emphasizes energy efficiency in climate mitigation, with pillars focused on building decarbonization, reductions in transportation consumption, and participation by low- and moderate-income and environmental justice communities.
Further action on EERS in 2020
Washington, D.C.’s Public Service Commission is also grappling with how to set up energy efficiency rules that allow utilities and a third-party administrator to contribute to the district’s climate goals. Last month, the Commission issued a working group report and collected public comments. New rules to create and implement energy efficiency targets are expected in coming months.
In Maryland, the legislature considered the Climate Solutions Act, which included provisions to increase the state’s EERS annual targets to 2.8% of sales, and HB 0982, which would set an annual energy savings target for low-income energy efficiency of at least 1%. However, the climate bill and the low income energy efficiency bill stalled in the recent rush to adjournment in response to COVID-19.
A bill in Illinois is similarly on hold while the legislature is adjourned. That bill, the proposed Clean Energy Jobs Act  (CEJA, or HB 3624) would move forward ambitious climate and energy targets, including a 100% renewable energy by 2050 target and extension of their electric EERS to natural gas energy efficiency as well. CEJA has received subject-matter hearings in both the House and Senate, and still faces committee and floor votes in both chambers when the Illinois legislature reconvenes. Those gas targets would reach 1.2% cumulative persisting annual savings starting this year and strengthening to 13.5% by 2035.
Elsewhere in the Midwest, DTE filed a revised integrated resource plan that accepted the recommendations of the Michigan Public Service Commission to increase energy efficiency, setting incremental annual energy savings goals to 1.75% in 2020 and 2% in 2021. Legislators in Minnesota also considered updates to its EERS, but efforts were delayed due to COVID 19.
Getting utilities to deliver the energy-saving improvements needed to meet state, city, and utility climate goals requires strong energy efficiency resource standards, together with a host of other tools. These new policies are a major step in the right direction for the climate and customers.

COVID-19 Is Slamming Efficiency Workforce Now And May Bring Long-term Changes For Efficiency;"The COVID-19 pandemic is taking a dire health and economic toll across the United States – including on people in the energy efficiency sector. In these stressful, uncertain times, we at ACEEE are doing whatever we can to understand and help address the challenges ahead. Already, it is becoming apparent that the pandemic is affecting the efficiency sector, especially its more than 2.4 million workers, as well as energy use and emissions in profound ways.
First, with most families isolating themselves in their homes and apartments, actual work installing energy efficiency measures is swiftly dropping. Few people want contractors in their homes, and many contractors either do not want to work in potentially unsafe conditions or are prohibited by their states from doing so. As a result, some contractors are put in the difficult position of having to lay off staff. Last week, a record number of Americans, more than 3.2 million, filed unemployment claims.
We checked in with Sealed, a New York company that finances key home efficiency improvements using the money homeowners currently waste on energy. It has halted all of its in-home verification and installation activities. The company’s weatherization partners reported this week that they had to lay off or furlough more than 45% of their workforce, with further layoffs likely.
These immediate and devastating impacts show the need to support such skilled efficiency workers until they can return to work when conditions allow. Hopefully, the small business loan program in legislation now making its way through Congress will help.
Second, even when the health crisis abates, the challenges for the efficiency workforce – and the cause of improving energy efficiency across our economy – will be immense. With large parts of our economy shut down, we likely have already entered a deep recession. A recession will mean reduced purchases of goods and services by consumers and businesses, including efficiency goods and services. A recession will also slash tax revenues for local and state governments, which could lead to cuts in their energy efficiency budgets. And a decline in utility revenues could reduce their efficiency spending as well.
The U.S. economic stimulus bill that the Senate approved Wednesday and the House is expected to approve tomorrow will help. Discussion is already beginning about a possible follow-up package, which could include investments in energy efficiency just as efficiency played a prominent role in efforts to emerge from the 2009-2011 Great Recession. We are working with the efficiency community on potential measures that could stimulate the economy while reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions.
Third, with the end of most in-person gatherings, many state legislatures are adjourning or recessing. As a result, many efficiency bills that were nearing enactment will likely be delayed until 2021. In Maryland, for example, a bill to strengthen greenhouse gas and utility energy efficiency targets was halted in the rush to adjournment. A bill to set new appliance efficiency standards in Maine faced a similar fate as might similar bills pending in legislatures now in recess.
Fourth, as the economy slows down, so do energy demand and emissions. Data from Italy show load declines, as do emerging data from several major U.S. power pools. Traffic and the resulting pollution from cars and trucks has plummeted. These changes are likely temporary, and when activities and economies recover, we could return to on our prior energy consumption and emissions – especially if efficiency improvements are largely halted.
Fifth, as many office workers get used to working at home and using video conferencing, this could have long-term effects, reducing commuting and the demand for office space, increasing energy use for home offices, and reducing travel for face-to-face conferences and meetings. It will take many months and even several years before we know how pronounced these trends might be.
COVID-19 is disrupting our families, our businesses, and our energy use and causing great harm and suffering, including to efficiency workers and employers. At ACEEE, we continue to work (from our homes) to achieve the ambitious energy-saving, climate-oriented goals in our new Call to Action. As part of that, we are determined to support our friends and colleagues now — and begin to prepare for the incredible challenge of advancing the long-term mission when the economy recovers.

Home Is Where The Health Is: How To Make Your Home Energy Efficient During Social Distancing;"One of the most important things we can all do to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic is simple: stay home. Whether you’re teleworking, taking care of a loved one, or just staying safe, spending more time inside can mean higher home energy bills. With that in mind, we asked ACEEE Buildings Program Director Jen Amann for advice on how folks can better manage their home energy use.
Amann: With the whole family or household spending so much more time at home, it’s important to prepare for a larger home energy bill. But don’t panic! Keep in mind that transportation energy use and cost will be reduced and help offset extra home energy.
Here’s how you can do even more to help the energy bill from blowing up too much:
  Experiment with your thermostat. Rework your thermostat schedule and settings to see how little you can heat or cool your home while maintaining comfort for all occupants. Don’t be afraid to dress comfortably for the season. You may need to look professional from the chest up for virtual meetings, but that doesn’t mean you can’t keep cozy in sweatpants and slippers if it’s still cold in your area, or stay cool in shorts and sandals if you’re in a warmer climate. 
Spring ahead. Spring began this past weekend, with temperatures warming for many. Take advantage of that by turning off the heat and opening the windows when possible. Too hot? Check out these tips on how to keep yourself cool. Need to warm up? Here’s how to keep your home nice and toasty without sacrificing energy efficiency.
Dine-in efficiently. More meals at home means a lot more cooking, dishes, and dishwasher loads.
When it comes to cooking, make sure you’re following energy-saving tips, such as using the proper-sized cookware for burners and the most energy-efficient appliances you have (such as a microwave or toaster oven rather than a conventional oven, if possible). Maintaining and cleaning your equipment properly also helps. Microwaves, for instance, work more efficiently when the inside surfaces are clean of food bits, and your pots and pans will conduct heat better and save energy if they’ve been scrubbed clean on the bottoms.
Time to wash those dishes? Save energy by scraping, not rinsing, extra food before loading the dishwasher, turning the water temperature down, optimizing your load size, and using the energy-saving setting or eco-cycle on your dishwasher.
Plan meals and snacks to minimize time staring into the open refrigerator. And if you’re able to patronize a local restaurant offering take-out, put the leftovers away all at once.
Efficient Electronics. Adults teleworking or following the TV news all day, paired with kids streaming content or playing video games, can cause a spike in your electricity bills. Encourage the kids to watch TV, stream videos, and play video games together to minimize the number of devices that are on throughout the day. Engage them in board games, crafts, and outside play when possible – great options for keeping minds and bodies busy and getting in some socializing (even if it is with an annoying younger sibling!).
Hand-washing Washing hands is a must, but washing in hot water is not necessary for safety during this pandemic. Multiple studies show that washing your hands with soap and cold water is just as effective as washing them with hot water. Of course, proper handwashing technique is a must regardless of water temperature. Using cooler water will also help keep your skin soft and prevent the dry skin and irritation that often comes with frequent handwashing. By sticking to cold water, you’ll reduce energy consumption and water waste, particularly if you have to run the water for a bit to get the hot water to the tap.
Doing laundry? Get the most energy-efficient loads by reducing your water temperature, using eco settings, and running only full loads of laundry. When it comes to drying, try to air-dry if you are able. It will save energy and wear and tear on your clothing. If you can’t air-dry, don’t fret. There are many other things you can do to increase efficiency, such as making sure your dryer filter is clean and running loads consecutively to take advantage of residual heat.

Energy Efficiency Employs At Least 2.4 Million Americans. Many Of Those Jobs Are Now At Risk.;"Before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the economy, the energy sector was an engine for U.S. job growth. A new report today shows that energy efficiency produced the most new jobs within that sector — more than 54,000 last year alone — and directly supported at least 2.38 million jobs. Now that much of that work is suspended, restoring and increasing those jobs will be critical as U.S. policymakers consider ways to shore up the economy.
The annual report highlights what was the growing demand for workers to make and install energy-efficient products as well as build energy-saving vehicles, homes, and buildings. As a rising number of Americans file for unemployment because of COVID-19 impacts, contractors nationwide who install efficient products in homes are being furloughed, and factories that make electric cars and efficient products are shutting down.
“The role of energy efficiency, both in the built environment and in transportation, cannot be overstated as a contributor to job growth,” says the fact sheet for the 2020 U.S. Energy and Employment Report, produced by the National Association of State Energy Officials and the Energy Futures Initiative (EFI), a nonprofit think tank. The report says energy efficiency and fuel efficiency contributed to more than 400,000 new U.S. jobs in the last five years.
“Energy investment is a winning formula to respond to any recession,” said EFI leader and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest J. Moniz in releasing the fifth annual jobs report. “We are now producing more energy, more cheaply than ever before and are using it more efficiently.”
The report, first published in 2015 by the U.S. Department of Energy, says the energy sector employed 6.8 million Americans last year and produced new jobs — 120,300 last year alone — at double the rate of the economy as a whole since 2015.
Energy efficiency has been a leader. It increased jobs last year at a rate of 2.3% and employed more workers than the coal, oil, gas, and renewable energy industries combined.
Direct efficiency jobs are just part of the total
The report says 2,378,893 Americans spent some or all of their time last year working with energy-efficient technologies and services. About a third of them — more than 826,000 — were directly involved in the manufacture, installation, design, wholesale distribution or other services of ENERGY STAR®-certified products.
Slightly more than half of efficiency jobs, or 1.32 million, are in construction, where workers install efficient insulation, windows, lighting, and heating and cooling equipment. Others are in manufacturing, wholesale trade as well as professional and business services.
This year’s report offers data that show, by technology application, the steady increase in energy efficiency jobs since 2015. The biggest increases have come in traditional HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) and in ENERGY STAR appliances.
  In addition to the 2.38 million efficiency jobs, the report directly ties another 0.76 million jobs to vehicle fuel economy and alternative fuel vehicles. Approximately 266,300 Americans worked last year with alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrids, plug-in hybrids as well as all-electric and fuel-cell/hydrogen vehicles. Another 494,000 made components that contribute to fuel economy.
For the first time, the 2020 report also includes the number of employees — 20,700 — who worked directly for utilities last year on administering residential, commercial, and industrial energy efficiency programs.
The report, citing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, notes that about 4.1 million Americans held jobs last year in retail industries that sell and distribute ENERGY STAR appliances and building materials along with other products. It doesn’t include indirect jobs that result when customers spend or invest the money they save in lower energy bills somewhere else in the economy.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, energy efficiency employers projected their 2020 employment would expand 3% or nearly 71,000 new jobs. With such projected growth, many employers expected difficulty in finding qualified workers. About 91% of construction employers reported that it was somewhat difficult or very difficult to hire new employees in 2019 although that picture will likely look quite different today.
We don’t yet know the COVID-19 pandemic’s full impacts on energy efficiency jobs. Many worksites have to come to a halt to prevent the spread of the virus, and the ability to pay for efficiency services is likely to decrease as the economy falters. But we do know how many Americans count on energy efficiency work. When it is time to rebuild the economy, efficiency can provide millions of jobs while helping consumers and fighting climate change at the same time.

"Energy Bill Misses Chance to Cut Costs by $40 Billion and Slash Carbon Emissions; Must be Fixed";"Washington, DC – The Senate energy bill announced Thursday by Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Lisa Murkowski (R-Ala.) and Ranking Member Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) includes useful efficiency provisions, but does not do nearly enough to save energy and reduce harmful emissions, and must be fixed. It omits a key provision to strengthen building energy codes that would help make houses and buildings significantly more energy efficient.
That provision, which the committee previously advanced with bipartisan support, represents by far the biggest potential energy savings of any of the energy efficiency bills the committee has considered. ACEEE recently found the provision would save almost $40 billion in energy costs (net after investment) over the lifetime of measures through 2050.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), said: “As it stands, this plan misses the best opportunity on the table to cut greenhouse gas emissions while reducing costs for households and businesses.”
“For years, companies that build inefficient homes have thwarted stronger building codes that would lower energy costs for homeowners and renters. We can’t let that happen again. Congress is going to need to step up and fix the bill for it to have a shot at becoming law.”
The Murkowski-Manchin plan includes several provisions from the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act (“Portman-Shaheen”), including measures to expand the Energy Department’s efforts to help manufacturers reduce energy waste and to train workers in energy-efficient commercial building practices, as well as a similar measure for building efficiency and programs for smart manufacturing and smart buildings.
While today’s bill contains several beneficial provisions, it omits the provision that would have delivered the bulk of the Portman-Shaheen bill’s potential energy savings, according to a recent ACEEE analysis. That analysis showed that in total, the Portman-Shaheen bill would reduce energy bills by $51 billion for measures through 2050, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by an amount equal to removing all cars and light trucks from US roads for a year. The overwhelming majority of those energy and carbon savings came from the bill’s provisions to strengthen building energy codes that are voluntarily adopted by states and municipalities – the provisions left out of today’s legislative package.
The bill also does not include a provision that would reduce energy use by accounting for energy cost savings in home mortgage underwriting.

ACEEE Issues Call to Action on Energy Efficiency;"As ACEEE celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, I am pleased to announce our new Call to Action to aggressively scale up energy efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. We need to put efficiency at the forefront of our efforts to build a vibrant and equitable economy that reduces energy waste, saves money, creates jobs, and helps those struggling most to pay their bills. And we need to do so quickly.
The climate crisis demands urgent and bold action. In addition to chairing ACEEE’s board, I am a parent to two young boys, and I am concerned about their future. Climate change threatens our global economy, our health and safety, and the ecosystems on which we depend. It disproportionately harms developing nations, low-income communities, and communities of color.
Energy efficiency can make a critical difference. It has a proven track record of slashing energy use and emissions while saving money. In fact, since ACEEE’s founding in 1980, efficiency has halved energy use relative to the size of the US economy, delivering more than $2,000 in annual savings per person. I am proud of the role that ACEEE, with its trusted, high-quality research and policy advocacy, has played in doubling energy productivity. It will continue to lead the way.
Today, ACEEE calls for an acceleration of energy-saving efforts. We need to mobilize at a pace and scale unlike we have seen before. Our research gives us the path forward. We have identified efficiency policies and programs that can halve energy use and emissions by 2050, getting us halfway to US climate goals. But to avoid the worst climate impacts, we need massive emission cuts this decade.
In our Call to Action, we commit to lead efforts and collaborate with partners to achieve six goals by 2030:
Cut industrial GHG emissions by one-third, and ensure that half of industrial plants use strategic energy management.
Hike fuel efficiency of new vehicles by at least 50%, achieve 20% sales penetration for electric vehicles, and cut passenger and freight vehicle miles by 10%.
Double the rate of existing building retrofits and make at least one of every four new buildings zero net energy and carbon neutral.
Deliver highly efficient cooling design and technologies for new and existing buildings.
Use efficiency as a first-line resource for electric utilities to reach 50% carbon-free electricity in most states.
Increase five-fold the investments in efficiency for low-income households to reach one-third of these households with comprehensive weatherization.
We know energy efficiency can get us halfway to US climate goals, but we cannot get there without robust investments in energy-efficient appliances, buildings, vehicles, transit, and industrial plants. ACEEE has created the Halfway There Fund to give us the flexibility to innovate, experiment, and fund the transformation needed for a clean energy future.
Quite simply, we are building a better world for our children and grandchildren. As we mark our 40th anniversary, please join us in celebrating energy efficiency’s accomplishments and work with us on the ambitious journey forward.

Better Together: Energy Efficiency, Solar, and Battery Storage;"Portland, Oregon is not known for its sunshine, but an award-winning campus center at Portland Community College expects to generate 347,000 kilowatt hours of electricity and save $27,000 in energy costs each year thanks to its combination of rooftop solar and energy-efficient design features.
The college built the new center with support from Energy Trust of Oregon’s Path to Net Zero Program. This initiative invites commercial building owners and businesses to set an ambitious design goal: make their buildings 40% more efficient than required by code. In return, the program provides a single point of contact for participants to receive design guidance, technical assistance, and financial incentives to offset the cost of efficient equipment and on-site solar.
Path to Net Zero is one of nine examples highlighted in ACEEE’s new report, Integrating Energy Efficiency, Solar, and Battery Storage in Utility Programs, released today. The report surveys dozens of programs nationwide, including those by the 52 largest US electric utilities, as well as statewide administrators and independent service providers. It finds 17 examples of programs that integrate energy efficiency with solar and battery storage (solar+).
Read the Report
“These integrated programs, although rare, hold enormous potential,” says Rohini Srivastava, lead author and senior research analyst. “They help customers save energy and money, reduce the need for electricity from fossil fuel power plants, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and by allowing some energy loads to shift, boost grid stability.”  
  Features of integrated programs
The report finds that statewide administrators, third-party providers, and publicly-owned utilities are able to offer integrated programs that take advantage of a flexible program design. They can simplify customer participation by streamlining services throughout a project’s duration and offer a one-stop shop where customers can navigate both energy efficiency and solar+ measures.
These programs engage with third-party solar installers and local contractor networks to coordinate program delivery. They may offer innovative and robust financing strategies like rebates for efficient technologies and loans to reduce overall project costs. Supportive rate pricing structures and pairing strategic efficiency measures such as heat pumps with solar+ technologies further reduce program costs. 
On the other hand, relatively few regulated utilities offer integrated programs. They tend to offer their customers energy efficiency and solar+ in separate, siloed programs. These programs may also be subject to different approaches to valuation and cost effectiveness that might discourage integration.
However, the report identifies a handful of regulated utility-led zero energy building programs, solar rebate programs, and marketplaces. They either integrate efficiency and solar+ measures through the same provider in a single offering or coordinate offers to streamline service delivery from different providers.
  Programs for underserved markets
  Integrating programs makes it easier to bring efficiency and solar+ to underserved communities.
In western Massachusetts, Energy Futures Group’s Solar Access Program works with low- and middle-income owners of single-family homes to provide a heat pump and solar photovoltaic array package. [MM1]  A key ingredient in this program’s success is the simplified, streamlined customer experience it provides: it connects customers to a contractor and uses only one heat pump installer and one solar installer.
The program also coordinates several federal, state, and utility incentives and offers a 10-year loan to reduce project costs. To drive participation, the program advertises at a local farmer’s market, fairs, and on a website with videos, testimonials, and financing options. After installing the systems, participants are estimated to save 40-60% on their energy bills.
Another example is from the west coast, where the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) has partnered with affordable housing developer Pacific housing to build the 2500 R Midtown Community Development. The region’s first zero net energy community project demonstrates the benefits of integrating energy-efficient features, solar, and storage technologies.
All 34 single-family units in the community were designed to be LEED-certified and incorporate energy efficiency measures such as demand-responsive smart thermostats and remotely controllable outlets. Customers with both a solar array and lithium-ion battery saved 33% more energy than residents with just the solar system. The bundle of technologies also allows the shifting of peak loads, thus delivering benefits to the grid.
  Need to identify best practices
“The success of these programs offers valuable lessons for administrators, utility managers, and others wanting to pursue similar initiatives,” says Srivastava. “We need more pilots to quantify the benefits of energy efficiency and solar+ integration and identify best practices for program design.”
The report offers these recommendations:
Streamline administration and create a one-stop shop for customers. Integrated programs require an extra layer of administration and coordination, especially when siloed departments and teams are involved. Reduce decision fatigue for customers by streamlining the process as much as possible, from connecting with contractors and installers, to selecting products, to securing financing.
Provide financial incentives to offset customer costs. To boost the program’s reach, incentives and opportunities should not be exclusive to high-income homeowners. Look for ways to remove typical barriers such as home ownership and strong credit.
Offer programs in partnership with local contractors and service providers. This will help streamline the customer experience and provide more platforms where customers can be introduced to integrated programs.
Focus on customer service to bolster engagement and participation. Programs need to clearly define the unique value proposition of integrating efficiency and solar+ technologies by emphasizing the energy and cost savings as well as the energy independence and flexibility they offer. Marketing and education can help customers understand and justify costly up-front investments
Target programs with clear policy needs to meet capacity constraints. Utilities should evaluate their service territories to identify areas and customers that could benefit most.  
Value the program’s multiple benefits in cost-effective testing, redesigned rates, and valuations.

US Utility Scorecard Reveals a Dramatic Increase in Energy Savings;"Washington, DC — The 52 largest US electric utilities have dramatically increased their overall energy savings as they adopt innovative ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to the 2020 Utility Energy Efficiency Scorecard. Leading the way are Eversource Massachusetts and National Grid Massachusetts, which tied for first place for the second time, followed by San Diego Gas & Electric (#3), Commonwealth Edison in Illinois (#4), Baltimore Gas and Electric (#5), and Pacific Gas & Electric (also #5).

Register for the Webinar
This year’s scorecard, released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), comes at a time of rapid transformation in the utility sector and highlights notable changes since ACEEE’s first such ranking in 2017. It finds that, as a group, the utilities boosted their annual energy savings by 20% since 2015, saving almost 20 TWh of electricity in 2018 from programs administered that year— enough to power 1.8 million homes. Notably, utilities are increasing efficiency investments in low-income communities and speeding the adoption of electric vehicles. 
“The most-improved utilities, Consumers Energy in Michigan and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, are impressively stepping up their energy-saving efforts,” says Grace Relf, lead author and ACEEE senior research analyst. By offering programs to customers that help them save energy, she says, Consumers more than doubled its energy savings since 2015 and LADWP increased savings by more than half. Yet Relf says progress across utilities is uneven, leaving a lot of room for improvement. 
The scorecard ranks utilities on 20 metrics based on their 2018 performance, programs, and policies, allocating 50 possible points. Notable findings: 
Eversource Massachusetts and National Grid Massachusetts, tying again for first place as they did in our previous utility rankings, each earned 92% of possible points. They offer a broad and innovative range of programs that reach many customers and target diverse end uses, including those to promote zero-net-energy buildings. 
Rounding out the top 10 are the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) (#7), DTE in Michigan (#8), Portland General Electric (#9), and Eversource CT (#10). These utilities all saved energy worth more than 1.5% of sales in 2018 — 50% above the average. They offer learning thermostat and plug load reduction programs, and they piloted new programs in 2018. 
LADWP and Consumers Energy (#11) are the most-improved utilities relative to the 2017 Scorecard. LADWP increased annual savings by more than 50% since 2015 and delivered significant savings for low-income customers. Consumers Energy more than doubled savings since 2015, responding to Michigan’s recent laws requiring increased energy efficiency targets and consideration of efficiency in resource planning. 
Utilities with the most room to grow include Duke Florida (#48), Jersey Central Power & Light (#48), Dominion Virginia (#50), Florida Power & Light (#51) and Alabama Power (#52). 
Utilities are dedicating more of their efficiency funding (on average 10%) to low-income programs. As a result, average low-income program energy savings (in MWhs) have increased by more than 60% since 2015. Thirty-one utilities offer comprehensive programs for low-income customers, such as home weatherization. 
Utilities are increasingly promoting electric vehicles (EVs). Sixteen utilities offer a financial incentive for deploying EV charging equipment, and six offer make-ready programs that allow other organizations to deploy this equipment rapidly and economically. Twenty-five utilities are using rate design to promote EV charging at off-peak times, an increase of six since 2015. 
 
Marcy Reed, president of National Grid Massachusetts, says: “I am proud that National Grid’s energy efficiency programs have been recognized as #1 in the nation by prioritizing low-income communities, electric vehicle infrastructure, and aggressive programs for high energy use commercial and industrial customers. We are committed to supporting the Commonwealth and our customers in our shared goals of meaningful deep emissions reductions and a clean energy future.” 
 “We are proud to be recognized as both a ‘top ten’ and ‘most-improved’ utility,” says David Jacot, LADWP’s Director of Efficiency Solutions. “LADWP sees energy efficiency as foundational to achieving our larger objectives of decarbonizing our energy supply and our economy, while keeping customer rates as low as possible by optimizing the system’s usage and reducing the need for costly infrastructure upgrades.” 
This year’s report highlights the ways in which the utility landscape has transformed since 2015, the baseline for our 2017 scorecard. New technologies are emerging; states, utilities, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the important role of efficiency in supporting emissions reductions; and distributed energy resources (DERs) are continuing to come online. 
Overall, the utilities offered more than 900 different efficiency programs in 2018, about 300 more than in 2015. Such programs, which can encourage energy-efficient appliances, lighting, and behaviors, deliver multiple benefits: they reduce customer bills, increased grid reliability, and facilitate greater use of renewable power such as solar and wind. Thirty-two utilities piloted new programs that involve smart thermostats, online marketplaces for energy-saving products, commercial energy efficiency financing, and integration of efficiency with other DERs such as demand response and storage.  
While overall energy savings increased, this upward trend was not universal, and seven utilities saw their energy savings decrease by more than 20% since 2015. Our scorecard also found that, while there is increased focus on changing utility business models nationally, utilities are generally slow to change these models and are often reluctant to give customers access to energy usage data.  
“Our results highlight the importance of strong state policies and regulatory support in utility-sector efficiency programs,” says Steven Nadel, ACEEE’s executive director. He notes that all of the top 10 utilities in this report are located in states that also rank among the top 13 in ACEEE’s 2019 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. Policies in these states―such as energy efficiency resource standards and financial opportunities for utilities to maintain and increase revenues while delivering efficiency―are important in driving performance. As more states adopt bold clean energy policies and include a prominent role for efficiency as a low-cost electricity resource and emissions reduction strategy, we expect to see continued improvements in utility efficiency performance in those states.   
Our scorecard, which received no utility funding, increases the availability of utility-sector energy efficiency data to enable benchmarking and help utilities strengthen their programs.  
We focus on the 52 largest electric utilities by retail sales volume, including all 51 utilities from our 2017 Scorecard, plus Tampa Electric. We gave all the utilities the opportunity to review the 2020 Scorecard before its publication.

: Coming Soon: 2020 Utility Scorecard to Reveal the Leaders of Energy Efficiency;"Get the popcorn ready! In ACEEE’s 2020 Utility Energy Efficiency Scorecard, coming next week, we put on our Harry Potter Sorting Hat to assess the 52 largest US electric utilities and reveal their energy-saving strengths and weaknesses. Which of the four houses at Hogwarts, the wizarding school in Harry’s universe, will each belong to?
WEBINAR: THE 2020 UTILITY ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCORECARD: WHICH UTILITIES LEAD AND HOW?
Register
ACEEE’s Sorting Hat considers 20 metrics across three categories (program performance, offerings, and policies), giving each utility a chance to show its true colors. We know that utilities differ in their market structure, customer base, and history of delivering energy efficiency, but we see opportunities for each to succeed regardless of the Harry Potter house they might have an affinity for:
The Ravenclaws, with their strong intelligence and wit, would likely score well in quantitative energy efficiency performance. They would likely win points with high net energy savings, spending on efficiency, and peak demand reduction.
The Gryffindors bravely forge ahead in efficiency innovation. Utilities sorted into Gryffindor would excel in piloting and promoting new and emerging program areas and technologies for energy efficiency.
The Hufflepuffs, ever loyal and rule-followers, would score well in policy areas. These utilities set themselves up for strong energy savings with rate structures and business models that promote energy efficiency.
The Slytherins, known for their ambition, would perform well in future-oriented metrics such as resource planning, promoting electric vehicles, and setting ambitious energy savings targets for the future.
So which categories will your utility score well in? And which utilities will be most improved since our previous rankings in 2017? We tip our hat next Thursday, February 20, with the second edition and webinar discussion of our Utility Energy Efficiency Scorecard.

ACEEE Analysis: Bipartisan Energy Efficiency Bill Would Significantly Cut Carbon;"Washington -- A pending bipartisan energy efficiency bill would over time cut carbon dioxide emissions by an amount equal to removing all cars and light trucks from US roads for a year, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) said Wednesday in a new analysis delivered in testimony before Congress.
Testimony
The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, which a US House committee hearing considered Wednesday, would cut energy bills by $51 billion, save 32 quadrillion Btu of energy, and avoid 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions cumulatively for measures through 2050, the ACEEE analysis found.
“The numbers are in: This would be the biggest cut of energy waste from any new federal law in a decade,” said ACEEE Senior Policy Advisor Lowell Ungar, who presented the testimony before the House Energy and Commerce’s Energy Subcommittee. “By spurring the construction of more energy-efficient buildings and houses, reducing energy waste in industrial plants, and assisting energy improvements in existing buildings, it would cut our energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, and that’s just smart policy.”
The bill, sponsored by Reps. Peter Welch and David McKinley in the House (HR 3962) and Sens. Rob Portman and Jeanne Shaheen in the Senate (S. 2137), cleared the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in September with bipartisan support, and Chairman Lisa Murkowski recently said she is preparing a package of energy-related bills that have advanced through her committee for a full Senate vote. The bill, introduced in an updated form last year, is supported by a host of business associations and energy efficiency leaders, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The ACEEE analysis shows that the bill’s provisions on building energy codes would have by far the largest energy-saving impact. These provisions would direct the Department of Energy to work with states, Indian tribes, local governments, code and standards developers, and others through a rulemaking process to develop energy savings targets for model building energy codes. The department would also assist state and tribal adoption of these codes and implement a new grant program to help homebuilders, contractors, trades, code officials and others cost-effectively implement updated codes. States and localities would continue to decide which codes to adopt.
A previous ACEEE study estimated that the legislation would create more than 100,000 additional jobs.
Ungar’s testimony also supported the Federal Energy and Water Management Performance Act, sponsored by Reps. Adam Kinzinger and Welch (H.R. 5650), which would help reduce energy waste in federal facilities, and a bill sponsored by Reps. Brett Guthrie and Jan Schakowsky (H.R. 5758) that would make technical improvements to the efficiency standard for large ceiling fans.

Electrification: Opportunities in Many but Not All Applications;"Electrification – shifting from fossil fuels to electricity – is a key strategy for decarbonizing the US economy. While it may not be workable in all applications, given current and likely technologies as well as economics, electrification can reduce energy use, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and save consumers money in many applications. In this post, we discuss key opportunities for electrification by sector and underscore the importance of energy efficiency as a critical partner.
Transportation
As a previous ACEEE blog post noted, the largest opportunity for electrification is in the transportation sector. Approximately 15 battery all-electric passenger vehicle models are now on the market, with an increasing share able to drive more than 200 miles on a charge. A recent analysis from Deloitte estimates that the industry will reach a tipping point in or around 2022, when in its view, the cost of owning a battery electric passenger vehicle will be on par with internal combustion engine counterparts. In addition, multiple manufacturers are now developing electric pickup trucks for market introduction in the next few years.
Larger electric trucks are also entering the market, as profiled in a recent ACEEE white paper. Battery electric trucks are likely to gain popularity first for delivery vehicles (e.g., Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans), then regional hauling, and ultimately long-distance hauls of up to 500 miles (e.g., Freightliner, Tesla, and Volvo are now road-testing 18-wheelers that can go 200 miles or more on a charge and are slated to enter the market by late 2021). However hauls longer than 500 miles will be difficult to undertake on a single charge – for these applications Nikola, Kenworth, and Hyundai are now developing fuel-cell trucks that run on hydrogen. According to the North American Council for Freight Efficiency, in the 2040s, the majority of heavy trucks on the road will run on batteries or fuel cells.
There are also electrification opportunities for airplanes, but only for short hauls. Several companies have built all-electric planes that can carry a few passengers. Work to develop larger planes for short routes is underway. For example, Wright Electric and Easy Jet are working to develop an 180-seat electric plane that can travel 300 miles, targeting 2027 for commercial service. Ultimately flights of about 600 miles may be possible. But the majority of air miles are in longer flights, which will likely require biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells, and hybrid fuel/electric models.
Industry
Industry is very diverse in its energy needs. While much of the sector’s energy consumption is fossil fuels, several industrial processes, such as secondary steel, aluminum, and industrial gasses primarily use electricity. Industrial electrification efforts have been in place for many decades, focused on niches where electro-technologies can provide productivity or quality improvements or create economic savings from retiring legacy systems, such as old steam boilers. Some examples include electric infrared heating, ultraviolet curing used for coatings, radio frequency drying, induction melting of ferrous metals, and membrane separation in chemical processes. Some low- to medium-temperature heating applications can use industrial heat pumps, which can go as high as 130 °C (266 °F). Many high-temperature processes in the metals, ceramic, chemical, and petroleum industries, need fuels for current processes.
Homes
Electric heat pumps can provide heat and hot water for many American homes. They make sense in new construction in particular, as they can save the builder money by not having to install gas service, and new homes can be built to be very efficient so that residents don’t need much heat, even in cold climates. The Rocky Mountain Institute has found that heat pumps generally make sense in new homes, including as far north as Chicago.
Likewise, research by ACEEE has found that for existing homes with natural gas heat in roughly the southern two-thirds of the United States, installing a heat pump when an existing central air conditioning system needs to be replaced can often save energy and money on a lifecycle basis. ACEEE has also found that in existing homes with oil or propane heat, the lifecycle economics of heat pumps are often positive in most of the country, except in the northern Midwest.
Depending on the system type and geography, outside of the upper Midwest, simple payback periods range from 1 to 16 years, with payback periods generally shorter for displacing oil than for displacing propane. In Minnesota, a field study installed heat pumps optimized for use in cold climates in eight homes and found they performed well at outdoor temperatures as low as 5-10 °F. But when temperatures got colder, the homes needed backup heat, typically from a propane or natural gas furnace. Over the course of the winter, the heat pump provided 60% of the heat and the furnace provided 40%, on average. Thus, partial – but not full – electrification is currently possible for existing homes in cold climates.
Commercial buildings
There has been very little analysis of electrification opportunities in the commercial sector. As with residential, going all-electric is much easier in new construction that in existing buildings. For example, Stanford University and the University of California Berkeley have established policies to generally go all-electric in new construction. And most zero-energy buildings use efficiency to dramatically reduce heating and cooling loads, often making heat pumps the preferred space conditioning system in them.
ACEEE is now beginning research on the costs and benefits of electrifying existing commercial buildings in the United States, examining different sectors (e.g., office, retail), building types (e.g., low- and high-rise), system types, and geographies. We hope to publish our results this summer. Though the research is just beginning, it is already clear that electrifying low-rise buildings is easier than electrifying high-rise buildings.
Zero-carbon fuels
If some applications will need fuels, which ones can we use? Renewable natural gas (RNG) (the term the gas industry uses for methane gas produced by landfills, manure digesters, sewage treatment plants, and other biological sources), green hydrogen (hydrogen produced with minimal greenhouse gas emission, such as via electrolysis using renewable energy), and biofuels will each likely play a role. For some industrial processes, use of fuels with carbon capture, utilization, and storage may also be an option. And for transportation, while currently expensive, synthetic electrofuels might be an option in the future.
However supplies of many of these fuels are likely to be limited; estimates of potential US RNG production range up to only 10% of current US natural gas consumption. Likewise one estimate is that even if all of the world’s current biofuel capacity was diverted to bio-jet production, it would provide less than 1.5% of the world’s jet fuel requirements. Use of energy efficiency to reduce consumption would stretch available supplies further. And all of these fuels tend to be more expensive than conventional fuels, sometimes dramatically so. For these fuels to be able to compete economically, we may need a carbon tax or some equivalent policy. Another important issue with biofuels is that they be produced sustainably so they don’t cause environmental problems.
Conclusion
There are many excellent applications for electrification, such as for many or most cars, trucks, new homes and buildings, many existing homes and buildings, and many industrial applications. But electrification does not have a clear path to viability for some applications, such as long-haul trucks and planes, high-temperature industrial applications, and heating existing homes in the northern US on the coldest days of the year. For these applications, we will likely need zero-carbon fuels. But supplies of these clean fuels will be limited and should perhaps be reserved for applications where there are no other viable options.

Leading States Have Designed New Ways to Help Utilities Fight Climate Change;"To control costs and fight climate change, US states are coming up with innovative ways to flexibly manage demand for energy use. New research from ACEEE and Energy Innovation finds that at least 13 states have created performance incentive mechanisms (PIM) to encourage utilities to deliver energy savings at specific times to optimize the nation’s power grid. This approach reduces emissions and allows utilities to incorporate more renewable power into the grid.

Demand reduction: key to lowering costs and emissions
Energy efficiency and demand response are essential tools to drive down the cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of electricity systems affordably and rapidly. These services can reduce demand at specific times to optimize the power grid, which we call “strategic demand reduction” (SDR). SDR reduces the cost to serve electricity customers by displacing the need for services traditionally provided by supply options, including substations, wires, and power plants.
Despite clear evidence of SDR’s value, utilities are just beginning to integrate it into their grid planning, investments, and operations (potential studies for demand flexibility and energy efficiency show vast untapped potential). One reason is that utility business models do not encourage SDR, because they depend on increasing capital investment to drive shareholder returns. Because SDR is often less expensive than traditional supply-side alternatives, it can forestall investment in resources that shareholders depend on for continued growth. Another challenge is the reduced electricity sales that result from energy efficiency, one option for delivering SDR.  
An emerging solution: performance-based regulation
One emerging solution is performance-based regulation (PBR), a revenue model that rewards utility performance in meeting policy priorities, such as cost containment and GHG reductions. PBR is on the rise, with policy efforts in more than 19 states and the District of Columbia, including recently launched efforts in Minnesota and Colorado. PBR has several policy tools, including performance incentive mechanisms that reward utilities for energy efficiency investments that meet specific, measurable goals.
ACEEE has shown that PIMs can be an effective tool for motivating utilities to invest in energy efficiency. This new research takes a broader look at how this tool can drive SDR at critical times for the grid.
Strategic demand reduction PIMs on the rise
Our research found that 13 states (shown in map below) currently have PIMs for electric utilities. Some focus on long-term adaptation of customer demand in response to prices and efficiency measures (called “shape” in the seminal California demand response potential study) and others focus on traditional utility and wholesale market demand response programs (called “shed” in that study).
                               Strategic Demand Reduction PIMs by Type
    We profiled seven of these states and found diverse approaches to rewarding utilities for their SDR. Some states used traditional utility procurement approaches to peak demand reduction, such as in Hawaii and Texas; in contrast, Massachusetts and New York used newer methods of encouraging SDR by compensating utilities for a mix of actions and outcomes.
Massachusetts recently demonstrated an evolution in metrics, adding winter and summer peak demand reduction goals. The utilities can meet these goals with energy efficiency as well as “active demand management,” which can include storage and demand response. New York’s outcome-based peak demand reduction and load factor PIMs (which it calls Earnings Adjustment Mechanisms) give utilities flexibility in meeting goals. Its approach enables a wide range of efforts, including demand response, energy efficiency measures with demand impacts, and rate design. Massachusetts and New York also differed in their award structure, with a shared savings incentive tied to different kinds of demand reduction in Massachusetts and a rate of return incentive tied to outcomes in New York.
Long-term, iterative PIMs largely successful in driving SDR
We found that PIMs are an effective tool for unlocking SDR. Of the five cases we studied with available results, four program administrators — in Massachusetts, New York, Texas, and Vermont — met or exceeded their targets. The others were too new or did not have results available.
A common feature was a process for iterative updates. With the advantage of several program review cycles, utilities could count on the regulatory certainty and stability needed to develop sophisticated programs, while still enabling regulators to update incentives to protect ratepayer interests and motivate continuous improvement.
Most demand reduction PIMs currently focus on long-term adaptation of customer demand in response to prices and efficiency measures (“shape services”) and traditional utility and wholesale market demand response programs (“shed services”). However states show increasing interest in moving demand from one time of day to another and in grid-balancing measures that target times when renewables create steep ramps in available supply (“shift services”). These approaches can better support distributed resources and renewables integration.
PIMs are one policy tool among many needed to accelerate SDR
PIMs are not enough to deliver the strong and varied SDR needed to reduce costs, shrink emissions, and accelerate grid integration of renewables. We need strong state and regional policies, including Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS) and other clean energy targets, business model reforms including decoupling and energy efficiency PIMs, and independent evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V). Properly valuing SDR will also be vital for prices and participation models in wholesale markets, rate design, and distribution and integrated resource planning.
Looking ahead to a new decade of renewable energy advances and state policy goals to address climate and economic issues, the importance of SDR will continue to grow. States throughout the country, from New Hampshire to Michigan are assessing their PIMs for SDR, and other states including Minnesota and Hawaii may consider these metrics in PBR efforts that identify related policy outcomes. Recent legislation in Washington calls for demand response targets and establishes authority for PBR, opening the door for demand reduction PIMs.

Global Survey: Few Cities Have Robust Clean Energy Policies in Resilience Plans;"Cities around the world are preparing for the challenges of the 21st century, including those related to climate change. While most include clean energy initiatives in their resilience plans, few do so extensively, according to ACEEE’s new global survey of 66 cities.
We found that, while many cities are taking some steps to increase energy efficiency and renewable power, only one-fifth include an extensive set of such initiatives in their resilience plans. These initiatives can help cities, which represent about two-thirds of global energy use and emissions, mitigate the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change.
“Cities need to step up and capitalize on clean energy’s multiple benefits by making it part of their resilience planning. Several, notably Honolulu and New York, are leading the way,” says lead author Dan York, an ACEEE local policy program fellow. He notes that energy-efficient buildings can improve grid reliability during extreme weather events and help maintain livable indoor temperatures longer than inefficient buildings during a power outage. Electric vehicles can shield cities from oil supply disruptions, and renewable energy can provide back-up power to critical buildings.
For example, after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, electric vehicles provided essential services to devastated communities, and during Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017, a solar power system on a San Juan hospital provided electricity.
Which cities do most to include clean energy?
To understand clean energy’s treatment in the global resilience movement, ACEEE rated the extent and quality of clean energy initiatives in 66 community resilience plans obtained from an international program called 100 Resilient Cities. We found that climate change is the primary driver for such initiatives in these plans, most of which include at least one measure to increase energy efficiency and renewable power generation.
Yet only about 20% of cities earned a rating of “exemplary” or “substantial” for energy efficiency or renewable energy initiatives in their plans. More than half received an “adequate” rating for energy efficiency (39 cities) and nearly half for renewable energy (32 cities). The remainder scored “lacking,” meaning they incorporate few initiatives or none at all. Key findings include:
 15 cities have plans rated as exemplary or substantial for energy efficiency. Of these, 4 are exemplary — Athens, Buenos Aires, Honolulu, and New York — and  11 are substantial. These cities are located in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Oceania, suggesting efficiency is a readily available global resource.
13 cities have plans rated as exemplary or substantial for renewable energy. Of these, 4 are exemplary — Chicago, Los Angeles, Honolulu, and New York — and 9 are substantial. These cities are concentrated in North America and Asia.
 39 cities have adequate ratings for energy efficiency, and 32 for renewable energy.
We also found that Atlanta, Chicago, Honolulu, New York, the Santiago metropolitan area, and Washington, DC, are the only cities to earn at least a substantial rating for both energy efficiency and renewable energy.
      We also looked at equity issues to ensure that cities are take into account the needs of the most vulnerable people in their communities in their resilience planning. A few cities — including Chicago, New York, and Athens— aim for energy equity, which calls for reducing energy burdens and improving energy affordability, but about two-thirds of the cities surveyed do not address energy or transportation equity at all.
Which initiatives can cities incorporate?
To bolster energy efficiency, cities can encourage electric vehicles (EVs) and other sustainable modes of transportation. They can establish municipal building and fleet efficiency policies, create microgrids, and require benchmarking, retrofits, fuel switching and/or electrification for buildings.
 Honolulu, for example, proposes a benchmarking ordinance for commercial buildings, a residential energy use disclosure requirement, incentives for electric vehicles, and expansion of its EV charging network. 
Buenos Aires proposes to expand bike lanes and bikeshare stations and to reward cyclists for each kilometer traveled. To foster transit-oriented development and transit efficiency, it plans to promote mixed-use development and 16 kilometers of railway tunnels that will strategically link the city’s rail system.
To spur renewable power, cities can aim to generate 100% of their energy from renewable sources and use only this energy for municipal operations. They can increase local wind energy generation, solar-plus-storage systems, and waste-to-energy facilities.
Los Angeles, for example, plans to leverage its municipal utility to replace 70% of existing electricity generation with renewables within 15 years to achieve a long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. It also plans to conduct a solar-plus-storage pilot on municipal buildings, with a goal to expand the project to vulnerable neighborhoods.
Energy efficiency and renewable energy can be critical tools in boosting community resilience by strengthening local energy systems and the communities they serve, delivering more-reliable and -affordable energy, and addressing the increasingly urgent challenge of climate change. Cities can be leaders in meeting these challenges by establishing and implementing robust clean energy initiatives.

How Are Us Cities Prepping Workers for a Clean Energy Future? We Take a Look;"As US cities take an active role in advancing clean energy, they will need a ready and capable workforce to achieve their goals. The good news: Half (37) of the 75 cities in our 2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard have clean energy workforce development programs, and in a new topic brief published today, we highlight innovative examples nationwide.
These programs and initiatives can help ensure that a pipeline of workers is set to join the growing clean energy economy. As our research shows, these efforts vary greatly, with some offering free hands-on training and others increasing city contracts to minority-owned and women-owned businesses. Some have a strong focus on equity and aim to recruit underrepresented groups for jobs using clean energy services and technologies.
Cities are not doing this alone. Many have cultivated partnerships with utilities, non-profits, colleges, and other stakeholders to support local energy efficiency and renewable energy workforce development efforts, which often provide the necessary training and certifications. In 2018, energy efficiency jobs accounted for nearly half of all energy sector jobs, and the sector is projected to grow nearly 8% in 2019, thus enabling even more economic and job opportunities.
Our new topic brief, Cities and Clean Energy Workforce Development, discusses the models cities can emulate to jumpstart robust and diverse programs, as well as inclusive procurement and contracting strategies. It draws on a larger ACEEE report about local government actions to develop an energy efficiency workforce for new and existing public and private buildings.
It also features case studies of cities with promising programs. In Florida, for example, Orlando offers energy benchmarking workshops for building owners, partners with a local college to develop an energy-focused curriculum, and offers mini-workshops on energy policy and solar installation to at-risk youth, veterans, and low-income community members.
Findings from the 2019 City Scorecard
Most (30) of the 37 cities with workforce development efforts have aligned their programs with existing clean energy policies and/or funded clean energy related trainings. For instance, Birmingham, AL, partnered with local institutions to offer energy efficiency training opportunities to Minority Business Enterprise contracting partners. By strengthening these skills among the local workforce, it plans to scale up energy savings and building efficiency in its municipal buildings and future efficiency projects.
The map below highlights cities that, based on our 2019 scorecard using 2018 data, have clean energy workforce development programs and/or procurement contracting policies to facilitate clean energy investments.
    We found that each city takes its own approach to clean energy workforce development, which may include cultivating partnerships with local businesses to sustain high-quality jobs, offering educational and technical support, and/or extending benefits to historically marginalized groups. The following cities have noteworthy approaches:
Buffalo – In New York, Buffalo Public Schools offer career and technical education for students in solar technology, with some schools offering students hands-on training and a certification in solar installation.
Cleveland – Through the Office of Equal Opportunity, Cleveland has an inclusive procurement and contracting process for all projects, including energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.
Denver – Denver partnered with Xcel Energy to implement a workforce development program as part of the Denver Energy Challenge that included contractor certification training, health and safety training, and business sales training.
Worcester – In Massachusetts, Worcester provided funding for the South Middlesex Opportunity Council’s Green Jobs Academy. The academy provides free or low-cost building science training to youth and low-income individuals.
For a more detailed overview and a look at what other cities are doing with clean energy workforce development, procurement, and contracting strategies, see ACEEE’S State and Local Policy Database.
These examples and the map above also highlight how cities are incorporating inclusivity and diversity into their workforce strategies. We identified 22 cities with equity-driven initiatives that target traditionally underrepresented groups and/or address disparities by awarding clean energy contracting opportunities to minority- or women-owned businesses. For example, San Jose’s Work2Future program trains young adults from disadvantaged populations in energy-efficient building construction. Since 2014, the program has successfully trained 267 young adults, and it has an 82% job placement rate.
While we profile cities that are helping to achieve energy savings and create real opportunity for high-quality careers for their residents, many cities have not established workforce strategies. Clean energy workforce programs must play a big part in addressing gaps in workers’ skills so we can scale up clean energy projects and extend the economic benefits to more residents, especially those historically left out of the clean energy economy.

Trouble Ahead for US Appliance Efficiency Standards;"The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) plan for national appliance standards for 2020 has come into focus, and the picture is not pretty. Hard on the heels of its rollback of light bulb standards in late 2019, the administration last week finalized its re-write of the process used for developing new energy efficiency standards. With this administration yet to complete a single standard update of its own and none close to completion, the re-write seems squarely aimed at tying the hands of future administrations.
A pending dishwasher final rule would not only roll back that standard, it would also take aim at the law’s provision prohibiting new standards that are weaker than current ones. Another pending rule would allow manufacturers to self-assign waivers from test procedures, and yet another would undercut standards for cook tops.
While DOE has been developing this slew of regulatory actions aimed at weakening the national program and taking it backwards, the agency has also been missing one legal deadline after another for updating standards and test procedures.
Is there any good news? With encouragement from DOE, manufacturers and efficiency proponents have been able to come together to reach consensus on how to make progress on future standards for two product categories, certain commercial air conditioning systems and swimming pool pumps. Now, it’s up to DOE to act on those consensus-based recommendations in 2020. 
Interested in more details on any of these topics?  Then read on.
Here are five DOE actions that will take the national program backwards in 2020:
DOE’s new process: harder, slower, and biased for industry. On Thursday, January 16, DOE released the final re-write of the process used to develop new and revised appliance standards. The new process, which DOE spent more than two years developing, adds steps to the regulatory process, increases deference to industry-developed test procedures and puts some potential new standards off-limits. See ASAP and ACEEE’s statement, and this Washington Post story for more details.
Anti-backsliding under attack. Responding to a petition from an anti-regulatory advocacy organization, DOE proposed to create a new dishwasher class that takes one hour or less to wash a load. Appliance manufacturers pointed out that a new class is not needed since about 90% of dishwashers already have a short cycle option, typically an hour or less. Here’s the rub: DOE would also eliminate the existing efficiency standards for these products. We argued—along with many others including the attorneys general of a dozen states and two cities, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Earthjustice—that the proposed action is a bald-faced, illegal attempt to circumvent the appliance law’s anti-backsliding clause. If DOE can eliminate an existing standard for dishwashers just by sorting products into a new class, then no standard is safe from elimination. DOE plans a final rule for early this year. Expect litigation. This story provides more details.
Forget about saving natural gas with future appliance standards. DOE plans to publish a proposed interpretive rule that will make it impossible for the Department to consider condensing technology as the basis for future natural gas appliance standards. Unfortunately, condensing technology is pretty much the only way to achieve large natural gas savings from appliances, and it could save consumers and businesses more than $100 billion while putting a big dent in carbon emissions from buildings that aren’t electrified. DOE initiated this rulemaking in response to a petition filed by the natural gas industry. ASAP and several allies have already submitted detailed comments opposing DOE’s plan.
Anybody can write their own test procedure. In spring 2019, DOE proposed a rule that would automatically grant manufacturers’ interim test procedure waiver applications if DOE fails to rule on them within 30 days. Since DOE rarely acts that quickly, we argued that the new process is tantamount to self-assigned waivers, striking at the core reliability of efficiency ratings and the national standards program. These “interim” waivers remain in place until DOE either grants or denies the permanent waiver or alters the underlying test procedure, something DOE is supposed to do within a year, but could take longer. Even if eventually denied, manufacturers get six more months to keep selling under the self-assigned waivers. DOE plans to publish the final version this year, but hopefully will back off some of the more reckless elements.
Standards for cook tops blocked. In August 2019, DOE proposed to withdraw the test procedure for cook tops, fulfilling a request from appliance manufacturers. As we pointed out in comments, data on the DOE record fails to support the Department’s proposed withdrawal. Eliminating the test procedure appears aimed at leaving consumers with less information and setting back any future administration’s potential efforts to set cook top efficiency standards.
DOE’s missed deadlines keep mounting, rulemaking work may pick up in 2020
Federal law requires DOE to review each appliance standard once every six years. If the agency finds that an upgraded standard is warranted, the new standard must be published two years later. Similarly, DOE must review each test procedure underlying national standards once every seven years.
DOE has now missed 21 standards deadlines and another 19 deadlines for test procedure reviews. Because the process for updating standards requires extensive investigation and multiple steps, it typically takes three years or longer. With most overdue standards still in their early stages, DOE will not be catching up on these overdue deadlines soon.
But, under increased oversight pressure from Congress, the agency appears to be picking up the pace of work. DOE’s 2020 regulatory agenda, published in November, shows that nearly every single product subject to DOE standards will have some active rulemaking phase in 2020. Election years are notorious for shutting down regulatory work, and DOE has rarely hewed to its published schedules under this administration, but, nevertheless, standards supporters should be prepared to actively engage in rulemakings for any number of products this year. For example, DOE opened the review processes for clothes washer and refrigerator standards recently, and solicited comments on revisions to the refrigerator test procedure.
Now back to the aforementioned good news. For two products, DOE helped foster constructive negotiations among manufacturers and efficiency supporters, including utilities, consumer groups and environmental advocates. An agreement reached last fall paves the way for DOE to adopt an updated test procedure and standards that will better reflect the actual performance of variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioners, a type of commercial air conditioning system. Earlier in 2019, manufacturers and efficiency supporters agreed on action to close a loophole in existing swimming pool pump standards. These proposals are now in DOE’s hands. 
This progress shows dialogue and compromise is possible, even in the current political climate. But, with so many pending actions that will take efficiency backwards, 2020 is shaping up as a year when any step forward could be swamped by DOE actions that will undercut national appliance standards.

2020 Hybrids Surge onto Greenest Car List, Joining the Greenest of EVs;"Washington, DC (January 22, 2020): After several years of all-electric cars dominating the annual Greenest vehicles list, 2020 brings a surprise – a resurgence of the hybrid, whether plug-in or gasoline only. With slightly higher scores, hybrids account for nine of the 12 greenest vehicles in the 23rd GreenerCars’ ratings, released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. These high-scoring hybrids include the Toyota Prius Prime, three others by Toyota, four by Hyundai-Kia, and one by Honda.
The auto industry, despite slowing sales, labor disputes, trade wars, and regulatory unrest, is producing more of the most technologically advanced and fuel efficient vehicles ever offered. This is great news for consumers, who continue to have plenty of options to buy a greener, more efficient vehicle.
While electric vehicles (EVs) get a lot of buzz, the top-scoring 2020 car reflects impressive improvements to the internal combustion engine that reduce tailpipe emissions and fuel consumption. Stronger tailpipe emission standards and lower emissions from the production and distribution of gasoline have also helped nudge hybrids to the top of the list.
“Some level of vehicle electrification is the clear path forward for both cars and light trucks, and for the foreseeable future, that will include everything from mild hybrids to all-electric vehicles,” said Eric Junga, senior transportation research analyst at ACEEE. “Gasoline hybrids are hitting seriously impressive fuel economy numbers and are available in nearly every vehicle category. And a hybrid full-size pickup may soon follow.”
The 2020 Greenest List features the most environmentally friendly cars now available. Each car is given a Green Score based on an environmental damage index (EDX), which reflects the cost to human health from air pollution associated with vehicle manufacturing, the production and distribution of fuel or electricity, and vehicle tailpipes.
Scores for many battery or all-electric vehicles (EVs) dropped slightly from last year. For some, this is a result of an update to the GreenerCars scoring model that calculates emissions from manufacturing different types of battery chemistries. Others, including the Hyundai Ionic Electric and Kia Soul Electric, come with substantially larger batteries and a considerable boost in driving range for 2020 that increase emissions from manufacturing and recycling and also slightly increase per-mile energy consumption.
Still, the greenest list has become increasingly competitive over time. We score vehicles on an even playing field that uses average emissions across the country, but the emissions associated with a particular vehicle can depend on many factors. One of the most significant impacts for EVs is the fuel used to generate electricity where the vehicle is charged, both today and in the future. Our analysis uses US government projections, which include slower growth in renewable energy generation than many other forecasts. For those considering whether a particular EV would fare better for their particular area, check out the GreenerCars Electric Vehicle Emissions Calculator.
“This year really marks the beginning of a historic influx of hybrids and alternative fuel powertrains. The days are long past where electrification was limited to smaller vehicles that may not suit everyone’s needs,” Junga said. He noted that hybrid versions of two of 2019’s most popular and practical cars – the Toyota Corolla and Toyota Camry – are now on the Greenest List. “No matter the type of vehicle, there is now a hybrid option, and we will soon be able to say the same about plug-in options as well.”
This marks the fifth consecutive year that the Greenest List contains no vehicle with solely an internal combustion engine. Even a small degree of electrification can greatly improve fuel economy and power, giving automakers an important tool to maintain the power that consumers expect, while allowing electric motors to help engines operate as efficiently as possible. Today’s results are truly a glimpse into the future of more-efficient and greener vehicles driven primarily by electrification.
GreenerCars.org also identifies practical options in each class among widely available automatic transmission gasoline-powered models. The Greener Choices list includes conventional vehicles and traditional hybrids, but excludes plug-in hybrids and pure battery EVs given the limited availability of charging stations.
Many of these vehicles return to the Greener Choices list from prior years, indicating both their popularity with consumers and the ability of the automaker to design and sell greener vehicles. While a number of models are hybrids, most are standard gasoline-fueled vehicles that achieve better fuel economy today compared to some hybrid options of just 10 years ago.
GreenerCars.org also provides a Meanest List, as usual made up of gasoline-powered large SUVs, pickup trucks, and European luxury cars that are the least friendly to the environment. The Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk takes the first (or last) position for a second year, with the rest of the list populated by regulars from prior years.
Green Scores of the 1,100-plus model year 2020 vehicles are available for free in the GreenerCars.org interactive database, along with each configuration’s fuel economy, health-related pollution impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions. Visitors can also turn to GreenerCars scores to determine eligibility for parking benefits at participating LEED-certified buildings. GreenerCars.org also features a 2020 market trends report and shopping advice, as well as a consumer primer on vehicles and the environment.
Changes to this year’s methodology include updates to estimates of vehicle lifetime miles travelled for electric vehicles, emissions associated with the production of gasoline and diesel fuels, and refinements to estimates of emissions from the manufacturing and recycling of battery electric vehicles.

How Can Efficiency and Renewables Help Rural Communities? Conference Speaker Previews Her Research;"Rural communities have distinct energy efficiency and renewable energy needs. While rural residents experience higher energy burdens than their metropolitan counterparts, energy efficiency programs can help offset these burdens. Renewable energy projects for rural homes, businesses, farms, and institutions can also help keep dollars local and increase rural prosperity.
We will explore these topics and others at ACEEE’s upcoming Rural Energy Conference next month in Chicago, our second convening to examine ways to advance efficiency and renewables in rural America.
    To give you a sneak peek, we asked one of our featured speakers, Sarah Mills, to preview her research on the impacts of renewable energy development in rural communities. Mills is a senior project manager at the University of Michigan Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy’s Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy (CLOSUP).
How do renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies benefit rural communities?
The primary benefit is economic. Rural property owners who in
vest in energy efficiency technologies or put renewable energy technologies on their property see savings on their utility bill, just like urban and suburban residents. 
Utility-scale renewable energy systems provide a unique economic opportunity to rural communities. In most states, renewable energy developers pay property taxes that support local government services like road maintenance, schools, libraries, and fire departments. In a rural community with a relatively small tax base, a $100 million wind- or solar- project can mean a huge jump in tax revenues going to the local government.
Landowners who host wind turbines or solar panels on their property receive lease revenue from the energy developer.  While revenue varies across and within states, my research from Michigan finds that landowners who host wind turbines on their property reinvest those dollars into their farms (see table below).  As a result, those lease revenues recirculate many times over within the rural community—to the contractor who is putting in field tile, or the dealership who is selling more tractors, or the lumberyard who is selling materials for new barns.
Question:  Since 2008, about how much money have you spend on…
Source:  Mills, 2015. “Farming the Wind:  The Impact of Wind Energy on Farming”; Based on a survey of 1,210 owners of farmland in 14 Michigan townships. 
How do state energy policies uniquely affect rural areas?
Because rural communities have ample land resources for siting wind and solar projects, any state policies related to large-scale renewable energy projects affect rural areas more acutely than urban areas. The renewable energy systems brought online to meet renewable portfolio standards (RPS) will largely be built in rural areas. Any subsequent state policy decisions—for example, how to tax or site renewable energy projects—will ultimately have the biggest impact on rural areas.
But this isn’t the only way state energy policies uniquely effect rural areas. Because electric cooperatives (co-ops) are more prevalent in rural areas, for example, state policies that do (or don’t!) apply to co-ops have a disproportionate impact on rural customers. For example, state energy efficiency requirements often don’t apply to co-ops. Similarly, utility-based weatherization programs disproportionately leave out rural areas that are more likely than urban areas to rely on delivered fuels such as propane or biomass for space heating. 
How is Michigan working to tailor energy policies to benefit rural Michiganders?
One of the key ways that Michigan is working to tailor its energy policies is by understanding how energy customers in rural and urban communities have different energy needs, service providers, and access to assistance. The Michigan Energy Office funded an Agriculture and Rural Communities Energy Roadmap that provides this comparison and further identifies the gaps, issues, and opportunities for policies to better reach rural Michiganders.
The state is also working to understand what information or resources local officials in rural communities need in order to incorporate clean energy into local government policies. I worked with the Michigan Energy Office to send a survey to the head officials in each of Michigan’s 1,856 units of local government—most of which are rural. We are using the data from the survey to provide templates, case studies, technical assistance, and workshops to rural officials.
What can other states learn from Michigan's experiences?
Just as it’s important to understand the differences between urban and rural communities with respect to energy, it’s equally important to realize that not all rural communities are affected the same way or need the same energy efficiency or renewable energy solutions. It’s critical to engage with a range of rural communities to understand those differences.

New DOE Rule Undercuts a Top US Policy for Saving Energy;"In yet another attack on energy-saving policies, the Trump administration today approved a rule that will make it much more difficult to set new energy efficiency standards for many common appliances and equipment — from refrigerators, dishwashers and home furnaces to commercial air conditioners and industrial motors. These standards reduce harmful pollution, save the average US household $500 each year, and according to the administration’s own fact sheet, will save the US consumers and businesses  about $2 trillion in total by 2030.
The Department of Energy (DOE) made major changes to its Process Rule that will add new steps to the already lengthy standard-setting process. It will significantly increase the energy savings threshold needed to trigger the process and allow manufacturers to largely design the testing that decides if the products meet standards.
Currently, efficiency standards cover more than  60 categories of appliances and equipment that account for 90% of home energy use and 60% of energy use in commercial buildings. Based on ACEEE’s research, appliance standards are the top US policy for saving energy in buildings.
This rule is the latest in a series of administration attacks on energy efficiency that include a recent rollback of efficiency standards for new light bulbs as well as cars and light trucks.
“These attacks defy the common-sense, bipartisan support that energy efficiency has long enjoyed,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “They will cost consumers and businesses money, create market uncertainty for businesses due to likely legal challenges, add to harmful pollution, and undermine efforts to address the climate crisis.”
Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), added:
“The Department of Energy designed its new process rule to make it slower and harder to establish energy-saving efficiency standards.  Since this administration has yet to complete any new standard of its own, this rule appears aimed at preventing future administrations from using this time-tested policy for saving energy.”
DOE has now missed 21 legal deadlines for updating standards.
DeLaski continued, “DOE claims they ‘heard the American people’s concerns,’ yet they ignored the comments of nearly 45,000 citizens who took the time to object to DOE proposed rule and the input of a range of energy efficiency supporters. This rule benefits the regulated manufacturers and hurts everyday consumers and the environment.”
Elements of the new process rule that will make it harder and more difficult to set new standards include:
A minimum savings threshold that will make new standards for many products illegal, even if the standards have zero cost.
Increased deference to industry developed test procedures, which may emphasize reducing manufacturer costs rather than efficiency ratings that give consumers accurate information.
Increased deference to standards established by ASHRAE for commercial products, a professional society in which manufacturers have a strong voice, rather than those developed by DOE.
A pre-rulemaking process that can lead to a decision to not conduct a rulemaking
Requirement that DOE “cover” products before setting standards. Since “coverage” preempts state standards, this provision sets up a process for DOE to preempt the states without issuing any federal standard for a product.
Requirement that DOE re-start the standards rulemaking process whenever the test procedure is amended. This provision could handcuff the agency, forcing a choice between a more accurate test procedure or more delay.
Requirement that DOE re-start the standards rulemaking process whenever more products are included within the scope of a regulation, once again forcing a choice between including products that logically should be part of a rule, or more delay.
A mandate that makes the process rule legally binding in all instances, which will create endless litigation further tying up future standards.

Electric Trucks: The Next Frontier for Energy and Emissions Savings;"A promising array of new electric trucks, buses, and delivery vans is slated to soon enter the US market, and to address climate change, California and a few other states are beginning to push for their wider use.
As a new ACEEE paper explains, electrification of trucks and buses can bring many benefits, including lower energy use and emissions—even when the impacts of power generation are included—as well as reduced operating costs, including fuel and maintenance. Other benefits include higher torque (useful for starts and going up a slope) and quieter operation.
Currently, however, these vehicles cost more up front, generally have reduced range compared to conventional trucks, and must depend on limited charging infrastructure. Efforts to address these limitations are underway, and leading experts expect electric trucks to be widespread by 2040. The speed of the transition between now and then is an open question. 
Electrification of trucks is important because trucks account for a substantial share of vehicle energy use and emissions. While trucks and buses are only 5% of the vehicles on US roads, they account for 27% of vehicle energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. Trucks also emit nitrogen oxides (NOx), black carbon, and fine particles, harming human health and contributing to global warming. Heavy-duty on-road vehicles account for 16% of total US NOx emissions, 15% of black carbon emissions, and 9% of fine particle emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s latest National Emissions Inventory.
Emerging market for electric buses, delivery vans, and tractor-trailers
Dozens of electric truck and bus models are now on the market, and many more are slated to enter it in the next few years. Leading states and cities have begun to transition their bus purchases to electric models, putting buses at the forefront of heavy-duty electrification.
Delivery trucks and certain other vocational vehicles are also well-suited to electrification and will soon reach net cost parity (considering operating, finance, and other costs) with diesel trucks for a number of market segments. They thus could serve as a bridge to electric trucks in a wide array of applications. Heavy pickup trucks are also an important segment; electric light-duty pickups are on the way, and the technology will eventually reach the market’s heavier segment.
Tractor-trailers are by far the largest energy user and pollution emitter in the truck sector, accounting for the majority of truck energy use, and they present an important but challenging target for electrification because of their range and charging requirements. Electric models currently on the market have a short range, but models with longer ranges (one manufacturer is claiming up to 500 miles) are scheduled to enter the market in 2020 and 2021. Most truck routes are less than 500 miles and might be suitable for electric trucks; for longer hauls, fuel-cell tractors, which could be better suited than battery-electrics, are scheduled to enter the market in late 2022. 
Overcoming barriers to wider adoption
In all of these market segments, electric vehicles (EVs) have substantially higher upfront cost than conventional vehicles, due primarily to the cost of batteries. To help bridge this gap, financial incentives and financing will be useful, if not essential. Zero-emission truck mandates, as California is now developing and other states are considering, are likely to play a pivotal role in increasing electric truck adoption.
Another critical issue is electric charging infrastructure for fleets and truck stops. Charging stations suitable for heavy-duty vehicles are virtually nonexistent today, creating one of the largest obstacles to heavy-duty EV adoption. For large fleet lots and truck stops with many chargers, the power needed to charge vehicles will be in the megawatts (a megawatt is average power draw of about 800 US homes). Electric utilities will need to plan for how they can bring so much power to these locations.
Electric trucks have a promising future, but much work remains in the near term to overcome present challenges. Priority should be given to overcoming initial cost barriers, including through financial and other incentives, and building the charging infrastructure.

DOE Publishes Four New Efficiency Standards, Bowing to Court Order;"It took a lawsuit, but today the Department of Energy (DOE) published the first new national appliance efficiency standards since 2017. The new standards, finalized under the Obama administration in December 2016 but withheld from official publication by the Trump administration, will cut energy waste for four product categories: portable air conditioners, commercial boilers, uninterruptible power supplies and industrial air compressors.  It’s an eclectic bunch of products, but the savings really add up.
DOE estimates that the new standards will save consumers and businesses about $8.4 billion and cut climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 100 million metric tons over a 30-year period.  That’s roughly equivalent to taking 21 million cars off the road for a year.
Depending on the product, manufacturers must comply either two, three or five years from today’s publication of the standards in the Federal Register. 
 “Will” means will
The Appeals Court decision (NRDC v. Perry), published in October, turned on the plain meaning of the words “will publish.” Under a DOE procedure known as the “Error Correction Rule,” DOE must make final rules establishing new or revised appliance standards available for review and allow for a 45-day period during which anyone can point out errors. Errors are limited to “an aspect of the regulatory text of a rule that is inconsistent with what the Secretary intended regarding the rule at the time of posting.“ Examples include typographical, calculation or numbering mistakes.  If no errors are identified by the public or DOE, then, under the rule, the agency “will publish” the new standards in the Federal Register. 
In the case of these four rules, one comment identified a single non-substantive error, yet DOE refused to publish the rules anyway. Demonstrating its zeal to avoid regulation regardless of its own rules, the law or the benefits for consumers and the environment, the administration argued that the words “will publish” really meant “may or may not publish.”
  Multiple entities challenged DOE’s failure to follow its own rules. Natural Resources Defense Council, and Earthjustice (representing Sierra Club, Consumer Federation of American and Texas Ratepayers Organization to Save Energy), and the Attorneys General of 12 states (California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington) joined by New York City, the District of Columbia and California Energy Commission sued.
Neither the District Court nor the Appeals Court had any sympathy for the administration’s attempt to twist the meaning of “will.”  The unanimous Appeals Court decision said, “the word ‘will’ unambiguously imposes a mandatory duty.”
It’s a shame that the current administration chose to waste three years and who knows how much taxpayer money challenging the meaning of the word “will.” Fortunately, the federal judges on this case have a clear understanding of the English language.
States step up
While the court case proceeded, states committed to policies that save people money and continue addressing climate change. In general, once a product has a federal standard, then states cannot set their own standard. But for three of the four products –- portable air conditioners, uninterruptible power supplies and industrial air compressors –- no prior federal standard existed.  As a result, states were free to act. 
Several states acted to make sure that efficiency would continue to advance for these products regardless of the outcome of the lawsuits. First Vermont, and subsequently, California, Washington and Colorado, adopted all three standards. Since the state compliance dates are generally sooner than the federal compliance dates published today, these states will achieve savings for their residents sooner. Perhaps some manufacturers will choose to simply comply nationally before the federal compliance dates, rather than meet standards in some states but not others.
These states have not limited their work to just these three products. They and others have generally pursued packages of new efficiency standards, seeking to step up as the federal government has pulled back. ASAP and ACEEE have provided data, analysis and model legislation to assist these efforts. 
What’s next
Keep an eye out for a future post from us on what to expect from the federal appliance standards program in 2020.  Spoiler alert: it’s not pretty if you’re interested in saving energy and money and reducing environmentally damaging emissions. The list of threats is long: the rollback of the light bulb standards, a re-write of DOE’s internal rulemaking process that appears intended to make it harder and more time-consuming to update standards; DOE’s attempt at an end-run around the law’s anti-backsliding clause; a rule designed to ensure that future standards for natural gas appliances do very little to save natural gas; and another that would allow manufacturers to self-assign waivers from DOE test procedures.  All vigorously pursued by DOE while the tally of missed deadlines for updated standards, now at 19, continues to mount.
But the four money-saving and emission-reducing standards published in the Federal Register today show that, although it may take time, these threats can be turned back. 
Note:  For readers interested in more details on the specific new standards and what they mean for the products, our 2016 posts provide information as do the rules published by DOE today.

Smart Meters Gain Popularity, but Most Utilities Don’t Optimize Their Potential to Save Energy;"Despite billions of dollars invested in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), new ACEEE research finds that most utilities have vastly underused this technology to help customers save energy. Our report, which surveys 52 of the largest US electric utilities, shows how utilities can tap such data to deliver energy savings.
Big data, big savings
We live in an age of “big data.” Our digital and connected world creates, transmits, and stores immense amounts of data on all aspects of our lives. Not surprisingly, AMI — which comprises smart meters, communication networks, and data management systems — has grown rapidly. A key element of grid modernization, AMI is now in place in many states, covering nearly half of all meters in the United States.
AMI measures our electricity use in short intervals (typically 15 minutes or 60 minutes) rather than by month. Our electricity providers can use such timely, granular data to better manage and optimize generation and grid operations, thereby reducing costs and responding faster to power outages. They can also use the data to offer better programs and share insights from the data to encourage customers to save energy.
Yet our report shows that only one of the 52 utilities surveyed — Portland General Electric (PGE) — is building its capacity to optimize use of AMI for saving energy. PGE is tapping all six of the use cases we have identified for applying the data. These cases fall into four categories:
Feedback: Moving from monthly, confusing energy bills to near real-time, customized feedback and applying behavioral insights on how customers can save energy and money.
Pricing: Shifting from fixed rates that don’t reflect the underlying cost of service to time-of-use rates that inform and enable customers to respond to price signals.
Data disaggregation: Using granular data for program targeting, evaluation, and innovative designs, such as “pay-for-performance.”
Grid connectivity: Offering new programs with grid value and customer bill savings, such as grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEB) and conservation voltage reduction.
Our survey showed that behavior-based feedback and time-of-use rates are the most prevalent use cases, with 26 utilities implementing each of these measures. The least common are newer applications: data disaggregation (seven utilities) and GEBs (four utilities).
PGE has developed customer applications for AMI data, which include customer portals to track near-real-time energy use, data disaggregation for key end uses, behavioral tools, connections to energy efficiency programs, and pricing alerts. It is also piloting time-varying rates and conservation voltage-reduction programs.
Three utilities in our data set, Commonwealth Edison, NV Energy, and CPS Energy, leverage AMI for five use cases. Twenty-one utilities leverage AMI for two to four use cases, and seven report using AMI for only one use case.
These findings suggest a large untapped potential for using AMI to deliver energy savings.
AMI needs to be paired with other tools
We found that providing customers with AMI data alone generally does not result in energy savings. Rather, the data should be paired with customer engagement tools, pricing and incentive strategies, and programs that enable, motivate, and support customers to take actions to modify their energy use.
For example, Baltimore Gas and Electric automatically enrolls customers in its Smart Energy Rewards program when AMI is installed. Customers receive feedback, peak time rebate incentives, and corresponding information on programs to reduce energy costs from energy efficiency and demand response measures.
Targeting programs to customers most likely to benefit from them is another way to leverage AMI. As an example, Pacific Gas & Electric found that AMI-based targeting for a home retrofit program could deliver 3.5 times more energy savings in targeted homes than in non-targeted ones.
Failure to optimize AMI’s potential for customer energy and cost savings can pose risks to utilities because these benefits are typically used to justify AMI investments. Regulators could deny cost recovery of such investments or not approve future investments proposed by utilities. There are cases of such regulatory rejections of AMI in Massachusetts, Kentucky, Virginia, and New Mexico.
How to optimize AMI’s potential
To optimize AMI’s potential for energy savings, utilities may need to overcome regulatory, technological, and structural barriers and take steps to invest in complementary systems and workforce, prioritize the customer experience, and pilot new approaches and ways of leveraging the data.
Utilities will need the support of their regulators. For their part, regulators will need to recognize, support, and promote the energy-saving benefits of AMI in investment approval and oversight. In many cases, they will need to establish protocols for data access. They can consider creating performance incentives to encourage use of AMI for energy savings and can also encourage new uses of AMI data through innovation and pilots.
AMI is part of the fundamental transformation underway in our electric utility system. We are rapidly moving from a system marked by large, centralized resources with one-way flows of energy and information to an advanced grid marked by distributed, decentralized, decarbonized resources with two-way flows of energy and information. Greater energy efficiency and flexible loads will be hallmarks of an advanced grid. Our research shows how AMI is a powerful tool for helping customers and utilities manage and reduce their energy use and costs, benefitting both. Most utilities do not currently capture these benefits and should take steps to maximize AMI to save energy.

US House to Boost Energy Efficiency in Bold Climate Plan;"Statement of Steve Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE)
(January 8, 2020) – US House members unveiled a bold and necessary new plan today that could go a long way toward addressing climate change. The House Energy and Commerce Committee's leadership announced the CLEAN Future Act, the first broad committee climate bill in 10 years. It aims to create a 100% clean economy by 2050 and, to help get there, calls for greater energy efficiency in transportation, buildings, industry, and utilities. Reducing energy waste is the cheapest, fastest way to reduce emissions while also saving consumers money.
Through months of stakeholder outreach, Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, D-N.J., crafted a strong proposal with important efficiency provisions, including: annual updates to emissions standards for cars and trucks, building codes for zero energy ready homes and commercial buildings, a “buy clean” requirement for industrial products purchased with federal funds, stronger appliance standards, home energy retrofits, electric vehicle infrastructure, low-income efficiency programs, a climate bank, and required state climate plans that should use utility efficiency programs to lower emissions. We will continue to work with the Committee to enhance the use of energy efficiency to further strengthen this promising draft plan.

Local Governments Vote Resoundingly for Improved Efficiency in National Model Energy Code;"January 6th, 2020—Voting results on the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) are in, and the approved proposals will bring an estimated 10% or more efficiency improvement for both residential and commercial buildings that follow the IECC. These changes will lower building energy use for decades to come reducing energy costs and helping to mitigate carbon emissions from buildings. Final energy savings analysis will be released by the U.S. Department of Energy later in 2020.
The vote comes after more than a year of effort by a broad coalition of organizations to update the national model energy code. The preliminary results represent the second biggest efficiency gain for the IECC in the last decade and puts buildings on a glide path to deliver better comfort, higher productivity, increased value and lower operating costs. 
“Homes and buildings account for roughly 40 percent of our energy consumption and carbon emissions, so this is a very big deal,” said Alliance to Save Energy President Clay Nesler. “It will save consumers and businesses money that can be invested elsewhere in the economy while significantly reducing carbon emissions. It is also the most significant step forward in nearly a decade to putting America’s model energy codes on a pathway towards decarbonization.”
The IECC is a model energy code that sets out minimum efficiency standards for residential and commercial buildings related to walls, floors, ceilings, lighting, windows, doors, duct leakage, air leakage, etc. It serves as the go-to basis for states and some cities that can control their building codes to develop local requirements. The IECC is updated every three years through an extensive proposal process and online vote of eligible voters, which come from local governments and related agencies.
Local government made their votes count. In November, when voting for the 2021 IECC opened, local leaders exercised their right to vote and chose to dramatically improve building efficiency. Extensive outreach and education by partners including New Building Institute (NBI), the Energy-Efficient Codes Coalition, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Institute for Market Transformation, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), and others helped raise awareness about the importance of the vote.
“Ultimately, the voting reflects an incredible effort by mayors, cities, governors, sustainability directors, and building officials to cast their votes for a code that helps them achieve their energy efficiency and climate goals,” said William Fay of the
Energy-Efficient Codes Coalition. “Many state and local leaders rely on the IECC as the basis for their own building codes. After two code cycles of stagnant efficiency improvements, these leaders have exercised their power and delivered a stronger code that will help everyday Americans.”
The 2021 IECC also includes two new appendices that provide pathways for states and cities that control their own code to move forward with zero energy performance requirements. The appendices describe energy codes for both residential and commercial buildings that over the course of a year would produce as much energy as they consume. This would be achieved through a mix of aggressive, yet achievable levels of energy efficiency combined with renewable energy like rooftop solar panels.   
“This vote says loud and clear that cities and states, which are voting on the IECC, want advanced energy efficiency,” said NBI CEO Ralph DiNola. “We are encouraged by the progress and especially the adopted zero energy appendices that allow jurisdictions to go even further than what the IECC calls for in residential and commercial projects.” In addition to the zero energy appendices, key areas of improvement include:
Higher Efficiency Through Flexible Points Options for Commercial and Residential.  Proposals to advance the flexibility of both the commercial and residential parts of the energy code were accepted by voters and provide a mechanism that make it easier for jurisdictions that want to further efficiency in codes. Many code requirements are very effective—but only in some climate zones, building types, or building designs. New options for choosing efficiency packages that meet a minimum points requirement provide a solution. By allowing for choices that may be highly effective in some situations but not in others, the code will lead to reduced energy use while providing builders flexibility to choose the path to efficiency that works best for each individual project. 
“This provision will benefit consumers by giving builders the flexibility to choose efficiency improvements for new homes,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Electrification and Electric Vehicles. As electric vehicles (EVs) grow in popularity, codes addressing them are essential. The accepted EV proposals require new buildings to make a certain percentage of its parking spaces ready for EVs by including electrical infrastructure. Electrification of buildings and vehicles–with clean, renewable power supply–is one of the key policy solutions for tackling climate change, and in new buildings electrification readiness can be done at a very small incremental cost. Also accepted were proposals that require electrification readiness when installing fossil fuel appliances and higher efficiency water heating sources, and require lower efficiency water heater types to be installed with renewables.
Residential Water Heating and Water Use. For the first time, the residential code will consider the water heating equipment chosen for a home. While builders may still select any type of water heater, certain equipment must meet more stringent requirements. As building envelopes have gotten tighter in recent years, a greater proportion of energy costs now involves water heating. Though equipment efficiency levels are generally controlled by the federal government, this proposal is structured to improve efficiency while not triggering federal preemption (as states generally can’t set their own standards for equipment which has a federal efficiency), and still provide builders with choices.
Lighting Efficiency. Multiple lighting-related proposals were passed including proposals to increase lighting efficiency in homes, add lighting controls, and install multifamily exterior lighting. In addition, a proposal on horticultural lighting was accepted that closes a loophole in the IECC that exempts lighting for plant growth.
“Building code officials, sustainability departments, and state and local agencies made their voices heard, and the message was clear: a strong energy code is the best way to make sure new buildings use less energy, reduce utility bills for consumers, and emit fewer emissions that contribute to the climate crisis,” said Lauren Urbanek, Senior Energy Policy Advocate at NRDC.
Kimberly Cheslak, Energy Codes Specialist at IMT, added, “Building codes remain a critical tool to raise the performance of all buildings to benefit all residents and occupants. As municipalities and private companies continue to set ambitious targets to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, the 2021 IECC will be an excellent tool to bring those goals to fruition. We look forward to continued work with our partners in code advocacy to deploy the new IECC.""
Now that the voting results are in, they must be certified by the International Code Council’s board of directors before they become official. In the meantime, there is a challenge period where any of the approved proposals can be subject to further review. The final 2021 IECC will be released later in 2020 at which time jurisdictions can begin adoption the new standard.
More about the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). The IECC is developed and managed by the International Code Council (ICC) and is the primary model energy code that states and cities, which control their own code, refer to when development local standards. ASHRAE 90.1 and 189.1 are other national model energy codes often referenced. Because buildings account for about 40% of the energy consumed in the United States, energy codes represent a critical lever for cities and state looking to curb energy use and resulting carbon emissions from the built environment. The IECC sets out minimum efficiency standards for new construction for a structure’s walls, floors, ceilings, lighting, windows, doors, duct leakage, air leakage, etc. Every three years, officials from municipalities and states across the nation vote on proposed changes to the IECC to incorporate new building technologies and practices as they evolve over time, and ensure that new American homes and commercial buildings meet modern-day minimum levels of safety, fire protection, and efficiency.

2019 and 2020: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly;"The past year has been a mixture of good and bad news on the energy efficiency front, and 2020 (our 40th anniversary) promises more of the same. Overall, there’s a lot to celebrate, but much more needs to be done to advance efficiency and address climate change.
The Good
I’m an eternal optimist, so let me start with the good news. Public recognition of climate change has been gradually increasing (e.g., 72% of US adults think climate change is happening), and even former climate skeptics such as the US Chamber of Commerce are recognizing that something needs to be done. ACEEE’s Halfway There report shows how energy efficiency can halve energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, providing a critical foundation for meeting long-term energy and climate goals.
Many cities and states are taking action. Their efforts include expansions of utility energy savings programs in New Mexico and Virginia, adoption of new state equipment efficiency standards in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, and Washington, and adoption of energy performance requirements for existing buildings in New York City and Washington state.
In addition, the membership of the International Code Council approved changes to its model energy conservation code that will reduce the energy use of new homes and commercial buildings by about 10% relative to the current code. Sales of electric vehicles are generally increasing, and more electric trucks are scheduled to enter the market in the next two years (as an upcoming ACEEE report will explain). Long-delayed federal efficiency standards for commercial packaged boilers, air compressors, portable air conditioners, and uninterruptible power supplies should be issued soon under a court order. And Congress just increased the federal budget for efficiency programs at the Department of Energy (DOE) by about 20% and maintained the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The Bad
Progress is stalling. The International Energy Agency reports that after many years of substantial reductions in global energy intensity (energy use per dollar of gross domestic product [GDP]), the rate of improvement is slowing due to a growing economy in many countries, structural changes, and a slowing of policy progress. Similarly, in the United States, the Energy Information Administration reports that after many years of improvement, US energy intensity increased slightly in 2018, while carbon dioxide emissions per dollar of GDP were level with 2017.
In Ohio, legislators decided to end or scale back efficiency programs so they can subsidize old coal and nuclear power plants instead. And in California, while the state has been a leader in efforts to address climate change (e.g., the state recently issued a plan for scaling up efficiency efforts), utility energy efficiency investment is unfortunately declining. This drop is due to a purported lack of available potential driven in part by an overly restrictive benefit-cost test that aggressively counts costs and misses many of the critical benefits of efficiency.
The Ugly
At the federal level, the Trump administration is accelerating work to roll back a variety of energy efficiency rules. EPA and the Department of Transportation have ended the authority of California, 14 other states, and the District of Columbia to limit vehicle tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions. Dozens of states have already sued. The administration has also proposed to roll back the federal CAFE (corporate average fuel economy) and emissions standards for 2021-2025 (though some news stories suggest it will ultimately keep small increases).
Light bulbs are another case with large energy savings at stake. DOE has issued two rules (see here and here) to prevent a 2020 standard for light bulbs from taking effect, keeping the current standard that allows some incandescent plus many halogen bulbs to be sold. States are already suing over the first rule and will likely sue over the second, because DOE is trying to do an end-run around several provisions in current law.
DOE is soon expected to finalize a proposal that would make it much harder to set new efficiency standards for more than 60 categories of appliances and equipment. It has pending proposals that would allow manufacturers to change test procedures and evade standards, prevent a furnace standard from requiring efficient condensing furnaces, and create a loophole in dishwasher standards. Lawsuits are likely in each case, with final decisions unlikely until 2021. If there is a new president, he or she could administratively reverse many of these actions.
The Coming Year
The new year promises to be very “interesting,” with the 2019 items discussed above continuing to play out, some in the courts. Because 2020 is an election year, there is likely to be more rhetoric than normal on energy and climate issues and less action, as enacting legislation in an election year, particularly at the federal level, is usually very challenging.
In 2020, much of the activity is likely to be at the state and local levels. New Jersey is developing a plan to ramp up its efficiency programs, Mississippi and Louisiana are considering proposals to expand programs, and states such as Minnesota, Michigan, and North Carolina might advance efficiency actions. At the local level, New York City and Washington D.C. will consider how best to implement building performance standards, and Montgomery County, MD, and Los Angeles may consider similar standards.  
At the federal level, there will be a lot of positioning for 2021, when there will be a new Congress and possibly a new president. The House Ways and Means Committee recently released a draft “GREEN” bill, the House Energy and Commerce Committee is preparing a proposal to get to zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis is due to issue its recommendations by March. Republican offices are also preparing conservative, market-oriented proposals to save energy and reduce emissions, such as Rep. Tom Reed’s bill on promoting innovation and the Clean Free Market Act, which would reduce taxes on income from clean investments.
At this point it appears likely that in 2021 Republicans will continue to control the Senate, and Democrats will continue to control the House. In this situation, passing legislation will require Republican support in the Senate (and even if Democrats win a Senate majority, if the filibuster remains, they will need 60 votes for most bills). Bills that might get bipartisan support include infrastructure investments, policies to promote technology innovation, clean energy and efficiency tax incentives, a clean energy standard (electricity targets that can be met with renewables, nuclear, and perhaps energy efficiency and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage), and perhaps a carbon fee.
With the election still 11 months away, preparations for 2021 are just beginning, but they offer a glimmer of hope that the federal government might join states and cities in taking action on climate and energy efficiency.
ACEEE will be celebrating our 40th anniversary this year. Look for celebrations at our Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings and at an energy policy conference in DC in December. Our board has developed a new “declaration” that will be released in February, outlining how ACEEE will work to leverage efficiency to reduce energy use and cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050 to address climate change and achieve many other benefits.
As part of this work, we are developing strategies to decarbonize the industrial sector, promote large vehicle and transportation system efficiency improvements, move toward zero-energy new buildings, halve the share of households with high energy burdens, and at least double the rate of efficiency improvements to existing buildings. We’ll be rolling out details over the course of the year. We look forward to working with many of you on these and other initiatives.

Great Holiday News: Building Code to Make New Homes and Buildings More Energy Efficient;"Washington, D.C. — New US homes will be more energy efficient, save consumers money, and reduce harmful carbon emissions because of a new and improved building code that many cities and states will adopt.  
We applaud the International Code Council (ICC), an association of code officials, for the substantial energy-saving improvements in the 2021 version of its International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), the model energy code for the United States. Given that buildings account for 35% of US carbon emissions, we view the IECC as a key vehicle for reducing energy use and heat-trapping emissions. 
  The residential code, approved yesterday by the ICC’s membership, will include a new flexible savings mechanism. This provision will allow builders to choose energy efficiency upgrades that work best for them to reduce energy use 5%, with improvements ranging from improved insulation to more efficient air conditioners and water heaters.  
  The code will also require builders to wire garages and parking places for future installation of electric vehicle chargers and to install electrification-ready circuits near natural gas and propane equipment. In addition, an optional zero energy appendix will provide a simple pathway for leading cities and states to require much higher levels of performance than in the standard IECC. 
  Code officials also adopted a number of improvements to the commercial code including requirements for improved building insulation, greater use of smart energy management and control systems, and electric vehicle charger requirements similar to the residential code.  
  ACEEE and allies worked hard to support proposals and conduct outreach to voters. We want to thank the ICC membership for voting in favor of energy efficiency, often by the two-thirds margin required to override recommendations of an IECC committee that opposed most changes to the code.  
  The previous two code cycles, in 2015 and 2018, resulted in very small efficiency gains in the residential code. “We are delighted that the IECC is back on track to improving energy performance and are confident that the new code will help cities and states reduce their energy consumption and carbon emissions” said Chris Perry, ACEEE’s manager of codes and standards.

Trump Administration Defies 2007 Law and Ties Americans to Energy-Wasting Bulbs;"Natural Resources Defense Council: Pat Remick, premick@nrdc.org, 202-696-6272

WASHINGTON (Dec. 20, 2019) – The Trump administration announced today it will block energy-saving standards scheduled to go into effect January 1 for the hundreds of millions of everyday light bulbs sold in the United States every year, which defies a bipartisan 2007 law passed by Congress. The action will increase consumer utility bills and worsen the carbon pollution driving climate change.
In its quest to tie U.S. families and businesses to energy-wasting incandescent bulbs that usually burn out within a year, the Trump Department of Energy (DOE) issued notice that it will publish in the Federal Register a “final determination” saying it does not believe it needs to proceed with bulb energy efficiency improvements envisioned under the law signed by President Bush 12 years ago. The decision could cost U.S. consumers an extra $14 billion on annual energy bills and create the need to generate an additional 30 large (500 MW) power plants’ worth of electricity every year.
“The Trump administration just thumbed its nose at Congress, America’s families and businesses, and the environment,” said Noah Horowitz, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s (NRDC) Center for Energy Efficiency Standards. “This law should have saved U.S. households more than $100 annually, on average, and avoided 38 million additional tons of climate-warming carbon dioxide pollution every year. NRDC will be exploring every option, including legal action, to fight this illegal rollback.”
The standards would have required all everyday bulbs to use 65 percent less energy than regular incandescent bulbs. Today’s affordable LED bulbs—which come in all common bulb shapes, sizes and lighting hues—more than meet that energy-savings level in sharp contrast to incandescent bulbs originally invented by Thomas Edison, which give off 90 percent of their energy as wasted heat rather than useful light.
“You wouldn’t use a phone from the 1870s, so why use Edison’s 1870s light bulb,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “Let’s leave the dark ages behind. Let’s embrace innovation, notably high-quality, super-efficient LEDs.”
Taking into account all bulb shapes and types commonly used in homes, incandescent bulbs comprise almost half of today’s U.S. bulb sales, which would have changed with the standard. With today’s action, the energy-wasting bulbs already phased out in several other countries can continue to be sold in the United States, which will especially disadvantage people living in urban, rural, and impoverished areas without access to large retailers selling efficient LED alternatives.
“The Trump administration is choosing to protect the sales of a few light bulb companies at the expense of consumers and a healthy environment,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP). “Even though the administration has blocked the new light bulb standards, consumers can save money and help the environment by choosing LEDs. Retailers can also pitch in by choosing to only sell efficient LED bulbs.”
The average U.S. household has about 40 lighting sockets and there are almost 1.5 billion sockets nationally that still contain an inefficient incandescent or halogen light bulb, illustrating the need for improved efficiency standards. Today’s incandescent halogen bulbs, which use four times more power than LED bulbs, represent a large share of the market.
Inefficient bulbs already have been phased out in the European Union and some developing countries are moving to eliminate them as well, putting the United States at risk of becoming a dumping ground for energy-wasting bulbs.  
The Trump administration had been signaling that it might not implement improved lighting efficiency standards. As a result, California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington, and Vermont each enacted standards effective on January 1 that are identical to those that should have taken effect nationally.  
In September, DOE rolled back the definition of the types of bulbs to be covered under the updated lighting efficiency standards, reversing an Obama DOE decision to include virtually all bulb types commonly used in the 6 billion sockets found in U.S. homes, including three-way, flame-shaped, reflector, and globe-shaped bulbs in addition to the most common, pear-shaped bulbs.
In doing so, the Trump administration ignored the 64,000 comments registered against the rollback, including from 37 major electric utilities serving 55 million customers in 42 states and the District of Columbia (representing more than one-third of the nation’s electricity customers). The only support for the rollback came from a few people who oppose regulations in general, several big lighting companies--General Electric, Signify (Philips Lighting) and LEDVANCE (Sylvania)--and their trade association, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.
The NRDC filed suit Nov. 4 against the illegal backtracking on the range of bulbs covered by standards, along with Earthjustice (representing the Sierra Club, Consumer Federation of America, and Massachusetts Union of Public Housing Tenants); the U.S. Public Interest Research Group; and Environment America. Fifteen states led by New York and California, plus the city of New York and the District of Columbia, filed a separate lawsuit in the same court. 
Today the Trump DOE said it would not go forward with updating any lighting standards even though they were required to do so by law.

Can Autonomous Vehicles Help Cities Address Their Climate Goals? Only If They Start Planning Now;"Cities need to lay the groundwork now for the arrival of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to ensure that AVs contribute to rather than detract from their transportation and climate objectives. An ACEEE toolkit, released today, highlights fundamental strategies that cities can pursue and gives them a policy roadmap.
As cities grapple with transportation challenges, many have started looking to AVs to improve safety, expand mobility options, and improve travel convenience. However, these vehicles can fundamentally change how people choose to travel. Their energy and environmental impacts will depend on who owns them, how many miles they travel, and the modes of transportation they displace.
Without specific policies to shape deployment and ensure net energy and emissions benefits, AVs could aggravate transportation challenges. They could add to already growing congestion in urban centers by undermining transit, inducing additional single occupancy travel and encouraging sprawl.
On the plus side, AVs also can bring transportation and societal benefits. Shared fleets that are available on a dynamic basis have the potential to reduce personal vehicle ownership in cities, expand transit service coverage, and connect under-resourced communities. As fewer and fewer urban residents feel the need to own cars, cities can repurpose land that has historically been dedicated to personal vehicles to support more efficient forms of transportation such as walking and bicycling, denser development where desired, and more affordable housing around transit nodes.
So how do cities make sure they achieve the “heaven” rather than the “hell” scenario? Policymakers will need to keep three critical outcomes in mind.
Promote shared-use low-emissions vehicles
To achieve deep greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions from the transportation sector, cities will need to direct residents towards the shared use of clean vehicles. This includes increasing the number of vehicle occupants per trip and discouraging widespread personal ownership of AVs.
In October 2019, Chicago proposed a downtown surcharge, in addition to a heftier per-ride tax, for solo Uber and Lyft trips to address the congestion impacts caused by ride-hailing vehicles, promote shared rides, and generate revenue for mass transit upgrades. Additionally, if AVs are to become a long-term mobility solution and help cities achieve their energy use and emissions goals, they will need to be electric and equitably accessible to all residents. 
Create a robust system of multiple efficient modes
Personal autonomous vehicles cannot be the primary mode of transportation for urban residents if cities are to address their transportation challenges and simultaneously meet energy and GHG targets. Cities will need policies that support a connected urban transportation system with efficient mobility options for all residents. Efforts must include increased public transit ridership through sustained investment in transit service and infrastructure, AVs to fill service gaps, and investment in first- and last-mile mobility solutions like docked and undocked bike-sharing and scooter sharing.
In Maryland, the Montgomery County Department of Transportation recently introduced limited flexible-route, on-demand bus service in two zones during specified hours, to better connect residents to transit and commercial hubs, as well as prepare for the arrival of automated transit service. The Ride On Flex service has no fixed stops or schedules, instead allowing residents to book a ride to any destination within the outlined zones.
Ensure the smart, optimized use of public space
Autonomous vehicles can change city planning and land use. In the best-case scenario, if shared use of AVs becomes widespread, cities will have opportunities to reclaim spaces now dedicated to the personal automobile. For example, they could reduce or eliminate parking-space requirements imposed on developers and expand bike and pedestrian infrastructure.
Mexico City is the largest city in North America to eliminate traditional minimum parking requirements, going so far as to replace those minimums with off-street parking maximums. Additionally, the city imposes fees on buildings constructed with parking beyond 50% of the established maximum, thus incentivizing developers to keep off-street parking capacity low. Developers are required to abide by another minimum parking requirement, however — for bicycles.
The arrival of AVs could greatly expand such opportunities to deemphasize auto infrastructure. Furthermore, as these vehicles become more commonplace, cities will need to start incorporating smart infrastructure into their landscapes so connected and automated vehicles can communicate with other vehicles as well as streets, traffic lights, and road signs.  
Policies available to cities today can help guide the integration of AVs in urban transportation systems to ensure net energy and GHG benefits. Because AVs bring enormous opportunities as well as significant challenges, their potential impact on GHG emissions and energy consumption is very uncertain.
ACEEE’s new toolkit outlines five policy categories that local decisionmakers can use to shape AV use: requirements for vehicle purchase and use, modified parking requirements and pricing, collection and sharing of transportation data, transportation pricing mechanisms, and transit policies. Such policies will help cities reorient their transportation systems away from the personal automobile and toward more efficient modes. They will also ensure that AVs do not detract from urban environments where public transit, walking, and biking thrive, connect seamlessly, and provide convenient and affordable mobility to all residents.

First-of-Its-Kind Report Reveals Dramatic Energy Efficiency Impacts, Warns of Stalled Progress in Face of Climate Challenge;"WASHINGTON—Energy efficiency is a diverse and immensely powerful toolkit that has saved hundreds of billions of dollars in energy costs while preventing sharp increases in greenhouse gas emissions, but progress is now at risk of stalling, a report today finds. The first-of-its-kind report from the Alliance to Save Energy, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy provides a consolidated analysis of the sweeping impacts of energy efficiency investments, policies, and innovation and the potential energy savings still ahead across a variety of sectors including residential and commercial buildings, industry, and transportation.
The Energy Efficiency Impact Report quantifies the scale of U.S. efficiency investments made over decades and their many impacts, ranging from energy savings, job growth, and reduced carbon emissions to public health and worker productivity savings. It notes these investments since 1980 have prevented a 60% increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions and are responsible for half of the carbon dioxide emissions reductions in the U.S. power sector since 2005. It also highlights the six most impactful policies – fuel economy standards, appliance and equipment energy efficiency standards, ENERGY STAR, utility sector efficiency programs, federal research and development, and building energy codes – which have saved an estimated 25 quadrillion BTUs of energy in 2017, equal to 23% of total U.S. energy use.
Despite these successes, the biggest opportunities remain ahead, and growth in smarter technologies and more responsive energy management could lead to new savings opportunities. Energy efficiency improvements using existing technologies alone could deliver more than 40% of the carbon reductions globally to meet Paris Agreement climate targets, and fully half of emissions reductions needed in the U.S. But the U.S. is not on this track to achieve these reductions, and even risks sliding backward, the report says.
While federal spending on energy efficiency has increased slightly from 2016 to 2018, estimated total domestic energy efficiency investment levels have fallen by 18%, the report warns. Energy intensity in the U.S. – the ratio of energy use to economic output – worsened slightly in 2018.
“There’s no question that greater energy and carbon reductions are technically and economically feasible through more ambitious action on energy efficiency, the question is will we treat this with the urgency it deserves,” said Clay Nesler, president of the Alliance to Save Energy. “This report shows that energy efficiency has been, and must continue to be, the leading solution to address the worsening climate emergency while simultaneously growing our economy and improving the health of our communities.”
 “Energy efficiency can slash US energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050, getting us halfway to our climate goals,” said Steve Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Given the urgency of the climate threat, we need robust investments in energy-efficient appliances, buildings, vehicles, and industrial plants.”
“Energy efficiency is the enabler for optimization and integration of clean energy technologies, and we need to scale it urgently to meet our energy and environmental objectives,” said Lisa Jacobson, president of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy. “Scaling energy efficiency is also critical to enhancing the resilience of energy systems. Recent disasters have strained energy infrastructure and buildings, costing billions. Upfront investments in energy efficiency not only decrease emissions but mitigate extreme weather impacts.”
The new report uses 54 indicators to quantify energy efficiency impacts, drawing primarily on data from federal and international sources. It examines efficiency progress in a wide variety of sectors including utilities, buildings, industry, and transportation, and explores the impacts of policy and other market tools used to incentivize energy efficiency.

"Tool Allows Communities to Assess Clean Energy Progress; Montgomery County Calls It ‘Innovative’";"Our 2019 City Scorecard assesses the 75 largest US cities on their clean energy efforts, serving as the beginning of a policy roadmap. Now, communities of all sizes can use the updated Local Clean Energy Self-Scoring Tool to track their progress, identify areas for improvement, and compare their results to peers.
The tool allows towns and counties to benchmark their progress across five policy areas: local government operations, community-wide initiatives, buildings policies, transportation policies, and energy and water utilities. To learn more about the range of policy actions on the local level, visit ACEEE’s State and Local Policy Database.
Don’t take our word for it, though. We gave Montgomery County a sneak peek of the newly updated Self-Scoring Tool. Montgomery County, located just outside of Washington, DC, is the most populated county in Maryland. Overall, we found it performed well, earning a score that would have placed it among the top 25 cities in the 2019 City Scorecard. The county scored best in buildings and transportation partly because of its benchmarking disclosure program and location-efficient zoning codes.
We talked to Lindsey Shaw, Energy and Sustainability Programs manager at the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection, about the tool and the county’s achievements.
How will Montgomery County use the results and insights from the Self-Scoring Tool?
For Montgomery County, ACEEE’s Self-Scoring Tool is an innovative way to monitor our progress towards our sustainability goals and compare the progress of a large county against smaller cities as encouragement to do better. We use continuing evaluation and metrics monitoring of our programs, so the Self-Scoring Tool fits nicely into our current systems for measuring progress. Using the Self-Scoring Tool regularly will give us status updates on how we’re doing, benchmark our progress against our local government peers, and identify specific areas where we can improve.
What has been the most effective program to save energy in buildings?
Buildings make up more than half of the county’s community-wide GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions inventory, so to meet our ambitious carbon reduction goals, many of our energy efficiency programs target both new and existing buildings. To address sustainability in new buildings, Montgomery County has adopted the 2012 International Green Construction (IgCC) code and is working on adoption of the 2018 IgCC. For existing buildings, Montgomery County has a stakeholder-designed building energy benchmarking and transparency program that has been in place since 2014. Both of these programs serve as engagement tools to talk to owners and managers about the operations of the buildings, as well as other programs (such as incentives, grants, and financing) that they can take advantage of if they’re upgrading their buildings.
How have recent transportation initiatives increased energy efficiency?
The most recent initiative that aims to address transportation efficiencies is the Transportation Demand Management Plan, which aims to reduce traffic congestion and automobile emissions and to support multimodal transportation. Enhancing the efficient use of transportation infrastructure through this plan is one of the most effective ways of increasing energy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. Also, our move to focus on mixed-used development, reevaluate parking minimum requirements, and open up pilots for more types of non-automobile transportation options have been effective strategies to combat congestion.
What challenges has the county faced while implementing energy efficiency policies?
Montgomery County is fairly progressive when it comes to energy policy, and generally has political and community support with new energy efficiency initiatives. However, as with almost any other jurisdiction, our limitations are ones of budget, staff capacity, and time. Competing priorities for limited budgets and challenges with filling staff vacancies quickly with high-quality candidates are prime limiting factors in implementing policy effectively. Despite this, we are still working to tackle big issues like our county’s climate emergency with effective policies, time management, and finding funding opportunities that we can leverage.
What advice to you have for other localities working to improve energy efficiency?
Montgomery County has only been successful in our efforts to move the needle on energy efficiency because we engage with our stakeholders often—both in the private sector as well as within other government agencies. When we design policies that created new requirements for building owners, we bring them to the table and ask for their opinions and challenges, and end up crafting a more effective policy with a receptive audience that feels more invested because they helped create it. Any jurisdictions looking to improve energy efficiency can create more effective policies if they bring their stakeholders into the process—whether its benchmarking policies, building codes, or outreach programs.

New Year’s Countdown: Our Top 10 Blog Posts of 2019;"As the holidays approach and this year comes to a close, we want to share 2019 highlights for ACEEE and energy efficiency. We released our popular state and city scorecards, spotlighted exemplary US efficiency programs, and ranked the greenest (and meanest) vehicles. Our Halfway There report showed how energy efficiency can halve US energy use by 2050 and get us halfway to our climate goals.
In addition, we celebrated the fourth annual Energy Efficiency Day, connected professionals at conferences including our inaugural forum on connected and autonomous vehicles, and promoted energy-saving policies at the local, state, and national level.
Next year, as political candidates, governments, and companies increasingly focus on climate change, energy efficiency will be more important than ever. To help you prepare, we revisit our 10 most-read blog posts of 2019.
10. How do efficiency programs serve low-income communities? New study takes a look by Ariel Drehobl
A growing number of energy efficiency program implementers across the United States serve nonresidential organizations in low- to moderate-income (LMI) communities, which stand to benefit most from efficiency investments, according to a ACEEE study that examines 39 programs.
9. Breaking barriers: women in energy efficiency tell their stories by Wendy Koch
Women account for only one-fourth of energy efficiency workers. To explore their experiences in this field, we asked the leader of an environmental organization and two Summer Study panel co-chairs to tell their stories. They spoke candidly, sharing both their inspiration and advice.
8. Deep retrofits: Financing needs to play a critical role by Steven Nadel
Deep retrofits to existing buildings will be critical for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions over the next 30 years. But such retrofits can be expensive, so financing is vital for unlocking energy savings. Several recent projects illustrate innovative ways to finance these retrofits.
7. Here are the ways we have slashed US energy use by a fifth by Steven Nadel
Major energy efficiency policies slashed US energy use by about 20% in 2017, saving a whopping 25 quads of energy —the amount used in California, Texas, and Florida combined. Two US policies now at risk accounted for the majority of these savings.
6. DOE refuses public hearing on a proposal that could gut US appliance standards by Andrew deLaski
The Department of Energy has quietly issued a proposal that could seriously undermine US energy efficiency standards for many appliances and products. It proposed a rule that would allow individual manufacturers to secretly opt out of testing requirements.
5. From construction to retrofits, PACE financing is saving serious energy by Annie Gilleo
Property assessed clean energy (PACE), a popular, long-term financing tool for energy and water conservation projects, has grown quickly in recent years across the United States.
4. What’s next after lighting? Regional Leaders offer diverse responses by Rachel Gold
As federal standards for lighting improve, many utilities and program administrators are looking at their energy efficiency portfolios and wondering “what’s next”? At our recent Energy Efficiency as a Resource conference in Minneapolis, we put that question to leaders from each of the regional energy efficiency organizations or REEOs.
3. Electrification and efficiency: crafting an enduring relationship, by Maggie Molina
As more states and cities set aggressive policies toward a carbon-free future, the energy industry is abuzz with the concept of electrification. What does this have to do with energy efficiency? A lot!
2. For existing homes, energy efficiency often has a better return on investment than solar, by Steven Nadel
Looking for an investment with a high, secure return on investment? A light energy efficiency retrofit of a typical existing home can reduce home energy use about 10% and deliver a whopping 18.5% return annually, nearly double that of long-term stocks. A medium efficiency retrofit saves more energy (29%), but because of its higher cost, has a lower return. Its return is similar to that of solar with net metering at a fixed rate.

Twelve Strategies To Step Up Global Energy Efficiency;"Washington, DC – A drastic reduction in global energy use will be essential for an affordable and manageable transition to a renewables-based clean energy future, according to a joint twelve-strategies report today by the European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, and the India-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy. The report offers recommendations to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global Commission for Urgent Action on Energy Efficiency.
“Urgent action is needed” the three organizations say, noting that global trends are going in the wrong direction. Global growth in energy use is largely outpacing decarbonization. In 2018, the IEA reports, the primary energy intensity – an important indicator of how much energy the global economy uses – improved by just 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.
This slowing rate of improvement is alarming and in stark contrast to IEA’s call to governments to commit to a global annual improvement in energy intensity of 3% a year. In order to get energy efficiency progress back on track, the IEA has convened a high-level commission with senior politicians and business leaders.
“While carbon pricing and the removal of fossil-fuel subsidies are important to create a level playing field for energy efficiency, price and market signals alone are far from enough to steer the world in the right direction,” said Nils Borg, eceee’s executive director.
The high-level commission thus needs to revisit energy policies and come up with concrete proposals that can deliver efficiency improvements. It is expected to deliver its recommendations in the middle of 2020.
“This can be achieved by ambitious measures on many levels, including innovation research, financial support, improved understanding of consumer behaviour and economic drivers as well as strict requirements for product, vehicle, and building performance,” says Steve Nadel, ACEEE’s executive director.
Satish Kumar, president of AEEE, adds: “Developing countries, including India, must aggressively promote a culture of energy efficiency while pursuing sustainable development goals. Energy efficiency offers the cheapest, fastest, and cleanest resource for clean energy transition while addressing the immediate and significant threats posed by climate change.”
Principles to support energy efficiency
The three organizations promote principles, including energy sufficiency and the circular economy, that support the efficiency strategies. Equally important are the multiple benefits of energy and steady work to track progress.
Energy codes and strict energy performance requirements are needed, and the paper points to the need for proper design to avoid expensive mistakes.
International knowledge transfer is an important element to quickly implement the most effective and actionable global policies.
Twelve strategies for global urgent action
The twelve strategies offer a comprehensive coverage of necessary policies to deliver efficiency around the globe. For each of the policies, the three organizations provide a brief overview of what is needed to realize that particular strategy.
Net zero-energy, water, waste and carbon buildings and homes are an increasing trend in regulations for new buildings, but they cannot happen without proper support and building code updates.
Home and building retrofits are very important since most homes and commercial buildings that will be standing in 2050 have already been built, making efficiency retrofits critically important.
Cooling is the fastest-growing end use in buildings as its energy demand more than tripled between 1990 and 2018. Low energy cooling is crucial to counter that trend.
Smart buildings and homes. Sensors, automated controls, and other smart software can optimize energy use and reduce it by 15% or more if applied correctly.
Electrification of space and water heating can often reduce both energy use and emissions in regions with substantial space and water heating loads.
Appliance and equipment standards deliver large savings. In Canada, China, the European Union, and the United States, appliance and equipment energy performance standards now cover more than 50 product types; these standards should be regularly updated and other countries should follow suit.
Industrial efficiency. According to the IEA, overall manufacturing energy intensity could improve by 44% between now and 2040 with 70% of the energy savings potential in less energy-intensive manufacturing sectors.
Vehicles have substantially increased in energy efficiency in recent years, driven primarily by ambitious fuel economy standards. Electric vehicles generally reduce energy use and often reduce emissions. More ambitious standards are needed.  
Reducing vehicle distance travelled and modal shift. Improved vehicle fuel economy will not adequately address energy use over the long term in the transportation sector if growth in vehicle distance travelled goes unchecked.
The freight sector can save energy through mode switching, providing seamless transitions among various modes; the digitization of logistics; “green corridors” and using collaborative shipping arrangements to optimize vehicle loads and avoid empty back hauls. Improved management of supply chains can also reduce and shorten freight shipments.
Aviation efficiency and long-distance travel. Energy use and emissions are growing rapidly in aviation. Increased access to trains and virtual meetings can help offset this trend. In aviation, improved engines, operational efficiency by air traffic control, airlines and pilots, and reductions in the amount of travel can cut aviation energy use and emissions by about 50%.
New electric grid technologies can reduce power losses in the grid (as well as in homes and buildings). Better grid design, smart metering, integration of demand-side management and demand-response interventions and theft prevention efforts can further reduce losses.

The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.

Companies Control Majority of Us Energy Use, but Most Lack Efficiency Goals;"As companies and even the US Chamber of Commerce embrace efforts to address climate change, new ACEEE research finds that companies directly control about three-fourths of US energy use and the associated emissions and do some reporting on efficiency. But most do not set energy-saving targets or have comprehensive efficiency plans.
In a striking but quiet reversal, the US Chamber of Commerce changed its position on climate change earlier this month to support US participation in the Paris Accords. That followed a reversal by the Business Roundtable in August, when the group of 181 of the nation’s leading corporate CEOs changed its statement of a corporation’s purpose to put serving customers, employees, suppliers, and communities—including the environment—on par with serving shareholders.
Despite these reversals, the two major associations still lag behind many of their members on corporate sustainability and climate change. Companies are setting sustainability goals, taking steps to reduce emissions, and reporting progress in corporate sustainability reports and financial disclosures.
Companies are key
They have plenty of opportunities. In our issue brief released today, we find that companies directly control about three-fourths of US energy use and the associated carbon dioxide emissions. They own office buildings, manufacturing plants, power plants, and trucks. We know that significant cost-effective energy and carbon savings are available throughout their value chains from lighting retrofits, building energy management systems, smart manufacturing, multi-modal freight systems, and many more efficiency measures (our recent report found half of projected energy use and carbon emissions could be saved by 2050).
Companies can also reduce indirect or “scope 3” emissions by making their products more efficient, giving their employees cleaner commuting options, and helping their suppliers reduce waste in their operations.
Given its large and cost-effective potential, energy efficiency should be the foundation for achieving corporate climate and sustainability goals. For example, last year, FedEx achieved almost 2 million tons of carbon emissions reductions (the equivalent of taking 400,000 cars and SUVs off the road) from more-efficient aircraft and flight operations, while also saving $394 million.
How do 30 companies stack up?
Our issue brief reviews how much companies are using efficiency in their sustainability efforts and how they can do so more effectively. It builds on a set of case studies we wrote last year.
The good news: Companies recognize that energy efficiency contributes to sustainability. We reviewed the sustainability or corporate social responsibility reports of 30 Fortune 500 companies to see how they talk about efficiency in four areas: in their buildings and plants, in their transportation and distribution, among their suppliers, and in their products.
Each report mentions efficiency in at least one area, and most track some company-wide energy use or efficiency metric. Often companies focus on areas of particular importance to them (e.g., Alcoa on smelters, UPS on its transportation fleet). But few companies talk about each of the four areas, and there is no consistency in the metrics companies use.
More companies need specific efficiency goals
Our review and other, more extensive reviews also find that well under half of companies set energy efficiency targets, an important tool to focus attention on energy-saving opportunities, help efficiency projects compete for limited capital investments, and ensure management visibility. Companies can set these goals based on an evaluation of potential savings or aligned with science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
These goals can take different forms, such as Bank of America’s goal to reduce the energy use of its buildings by 40%, Caterpillar’s goal to reduce its energy intensity per dollar of revenue by 50%, or multiple airlines’ fuel-savings goals.
Increased financial reporting on climate risks
There is increasing focus on financial reporting to address large investors’ concerns about climate risks, including CDP’s broad collection of climate-related information from companies and multiple environmental, social, and corporate governance ratings of companies, as well as official filings. These also lack common metrics for efficiency and in some cases lack transparency.
The international Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, however, has created a broad framework for reporting, and the US-based Sustainable Accounting Standards Board has created prescriptive disclosure standards for 79 industries, many of which include efficiency metrics. It is too soon to know how much these guidelines will improve energy-efficiency and climate reporting and, ultimately, progress.
Energy efficiency measures can provide large cost-effective savings to meet sustainability goals, and sustainability goals and reporting can provide motivation to improve efficiency. We recommend that companies set energy efficiency targets, pursue efficiency across their value chains, set up systems for continuous improvement, and report on overall progress. We also recommend that reporting organizations and investors seek to standardize disclosure (by industry) while also consolidating reporting to reduce needed effort. With efficiency, companies can improve both their bottom lines and the world’s climate.

Grid-interactive Efficient Buildings Are the Future, and Utilities Can Help Lead the Way;"More utilities across the United States are adopting programs to promote grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs), which will be critical to the grid of the future. Some programs focus on energy savings and others on demand flexibility, but none of those surveyed reap the benefits of fully integrating both, according to ACEEE research released today.
These buildings, also called “smart buildings,” are increasingly important. They can help utilities adapt to rapid changes in the grid, including the adoption of technologies like electric vehicles and heat pumps, as well as new policy directions like beneficial electrification. They deliver substantial energy and emission reductions by using highly efficient materials and equipment. They can also act as resources to the grid, by using less overall energy than a normal building and strategically shifting or reducing energy consumption during peak times.
Utilities and program administrators would benefit greatly from creating programs that accurately value both energy efficiency and grid flexibility benefits. Instead, these programs remain segregated with separate goals and objectives.
GEB programs vary widely
  Utilities are expanding programs to make buildings efficient and grid interactive. The plot below shows a range of program types. The lower end of the scale (representing less complexity and integration) includes programs like automated demand response (ADR) that send a signal to equipment in a building to reduce its load. These programs, such as Duke Energy’s EnergyWise program and Austin Energy’s Load Co-op pilot, do a great job of providing grid benefits, but do not include energy efficiency.
Moving up the scale, other ADR programs also promote energy efficiency by offering additional incentives for efficiency measures, such as PG&E’s ADR program and Dominion’s Smart Thermostat program.
  Scaling up to GEB programs
  Other program types use different methods to integrate energy efficiency and grid benefits; however, none are fully integrated in what we consider a “GEB program,” at the upper end of the scale.
Integration faces barriers
One of the biggest barriers to these fully integrated programs is determining the fair, accurate value of energy efficiency and grid benefits. As an example, efficiency programs typically incentivize products and technologies that reduce overall energy consumption, while demand response programs may prefer technologies that have greater capacity to store or shift the load when needed, though they might use more energy.
Other barriers include a lack of interoperability standards for commercial building energy management and information systems to communicate with the grid, “siloed” organizational structures that don’t promote coordination between energy efficiency and grid flexibility departments, and lack of policy support for grid-interactive efficient buildings.
To address these barriers, we recommend utilities and program administrators work toward full-fledged GEB programs. They can lay a foundation now by:
Piloting new programs, with smart and connected equipment
Combining energy efficiency and demand response teams
Upgrading their IT department and energy management systems
Subsidizing services, not just technologies
Tracking ongoing research and policies that enable GEBs
Promising steps ahead
Although utility programs do not currently promote grid services and energy efficiency equally, there are reasons to be optimistic. California has developed policies to help promote grid-interactive efficient buildings. New York University is currently researching interoperability for energy management and information systems. New Buildings Institute (NBI) is collaborating with utilities to develop a framework to value grid services. Utilities, including Southern Company and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), are conducting pilots (mostly residential, for now) that aggregate different demand energy resources to help improve demand flexibility.
We will need all these initiatives and more to help us reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, as well as adapt to the rapidly changing grid.

British Columbia Tops Provinces in Canada’s First-ever Energy Efficiency Scorecard;"British Columbia earns top marks in the first-ever Canadian Provincial Energy Efficiency Scorecard, developed by the nonprofit Efficiency Canada to track and rank provinces on their efficiency policies and highlight opportunities for improvement.
ACEEE congratulates Efficiency Canada on today’s release of its new scorecard, which has been more than a year in the making. Together with its companion policy database, the scorecard seeks to provide a comprehensive resource to benchmark and improve energy savings across the Great White North.
Special kudos are in order for British Columbia, Canada’s westernmost province, for its adoption of a broad mix of successful efficiency policies across multiple sectors. Second and third place went to Quebec and Ontario, respectively.
As in the United States, where many policy decisions to support energy efficiency are left to the state and local governments, Canada’s important policy areas such as public utility regulation, building codes, and municipal planning fall under provincial jurisdiction. For this reason, provinces play a critical role in driving national energy savings from Vancouver to Nova Scotia, much as state governments have set the pace on efficiency across the United States. 
The new scorecard seeks to capture these provincial-level efforts in ways similar to ACEEE’s own State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, tracking performance and policies on more than 20 metrics across five policy areas, including buildings, transportation, and industry.
For example, in 2017, British Columbia enacted the BC Energy Step Code, a voluntary provincial building standard that exceeds the base BC Building Code, and that local governments can choose to require or encourage builders to meet. The code takes a performance-based approach, rather than the traditional prescriptive approach, and is fuel-neutral, giving builders flexibility to determine how to meet the standard.
The regulation outlines a hierarchical progression of performance targets grouped into “steps,” which local governments can select for adoption. Upper steps are more ambitious and designed to move the province toward the goal of making all new buildings net-zero energy ready by 2032. More than 50 cities, representing at least 70% of the province’s residential construction, have already adopted these codes. British Columbia also has a long-standing carbon price, grid modernization initiatives, and commitment to vehicle electrification.
The scorecard’s release caps a busy year for Efficiency Canada, which had its official launch just one year ago with a mission to make Canada a global leader in energy efficiency. Housed at Carleton University’s Sustainable Energy Research Centre in Ottawa, the independent nonprofit organization has worked extensively with stakeholders across governments and utilities to craft and refine a robust and transparent methodology to evaluate provincial energy efficiency policies.
Alongside Dunsky Consulting and others, ACEEE is pleased to have participated in this process by sharing the lessons we have learned from 13 years of publishing our State Energy Efficiency Scorecard and helping apply them to Canada. We are impressed by the ambitious scope and sophistication of Efficiency Canada’s primary and secondary data-collection process, which in just a short time has yielded a detailed report and policy database that will serve as an invaluable resource for efficiency-minded policymakers and advocates.
While we caution against drawing any direct comparisons between scores in the provincial scorecard and those in the state scorecard, we’re very excited to see the latter’s influence cross national lines to serve as a model for our neighbors to the north, and we look forward to seeing the Canadian Scorecard’s success and evolution in the coming years.

How Do Efficiency Programs Serve Low-income Communities? New Study Takes a Look.;"A growing number of energy efficiency program implementers across the United States serve nonresidential organizations in low- to moderate-income (LMI) communities, which stand to benefit most from efficiency investments, according to an ACEEE study released today.
Our research is the first to explore how these program implementers are trying to reach LMI communities by providing services to local groups such as nonprofits, schools, government offices, businesses, medical facilities, shelters, and community centers. We examined 39 programs serving such nonresidential organizations in LMI communities and found that six exclusively target low-income areas. The other 33 programs use targeted outreach and incentives to reach LMI communities within existing programs. This approach facilitates enrollment and participation for organizations in these communities.
Typically, low-income energy efficiency programs focus on residential buildings. They do not often reach or serve nonresidential organizations, though energy efficiency provides many benefits to community-serving institutions in low-income areas. It can reduce capital and maintenance costs, shorten time spent on building maintenance, and reduce monthly utility bills. As a result, these institutions can spend more of their money on their projects and within their communities. Energy efficiency can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve indoor health, and boost economic stability.
Despite these benefits, community-serving institutions in LMI communities often have fewer financial resources and face additional barriers to investing in energy efficiency. They deal with historical policies of economic and social exclusion, such as discriminatory lending practices, underinvestment, and redlining. Therefore, these organizations may need additional resources to improve energy efficiency in their buildings.
What our study reveals
The 39 programs we analyzed are offered by 28 implementers across 22 states. About a third of the programs serve only one organization type, while the rest serve multiple types of organizations. Nonprofits are the most common organization served, followed by small businesses, educational institutions, and religious centers.
Although approaches differ in scope, most programs offer measures with high energy saving potential (e.g., lighting, heating system upgrades) as well as additional guidance.  
Program implementers indicate that partnerships are key to success. They said they were better able to reach potential participants and gain valuable stakeholder input by partnering with local governments, other community-based organizations, and chambers of commerce. Key strategies for success include continuously engaging stakeholders, developing strong partnerships, and tailoring program marketing.
How two programs work
We found many programs that successfully serve community-based institutions. For example, Energy Outreach Colorado’s Nonprofit Energy Efficiency Program helps nonprofit organizations serving limited-income communities in the state reduce their energy bills, which allows them to dedicate more resources to their communities. It provides a one-stop-shop model for nonprofits, offering energy audits, weatherization measures, heating and cooling upgrades, health and safety improvements, and contractor management.

Another example is Eversource Energy’s Main Street Program, which provides tailored outreach materials, detailed energy audits, and direct install measures for small businesses in downtown areas of target communities. Eversource works with Massachusetts cities and towns through their community and economic development offices, local chambers of commerce, and other local businesses to reach small businesses. It selects communities based on input from community-based partners and stakeholder engagement and aims to reach those with historically low participation in efficiency programs, often low-income communities.

What others can do
While our survey identified many program examples, these programs are not yet commonplace. Policymakers and program implementers can take action to further expand and improve these programs. They can pass legislation, set policy targets, or change cost-effectiveness requirements for programs that serve nonresidential organizations in LMI communities. For example, regulators or program implementers can conduct a needs assessment on the potential energy savings of community-based efficiency programs, which can then influence program design and policy choices.
Policymakers can ensure that robust financing options are available to help cover program costs, such as on-bill programs, green leasing, Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE), and green banks. They can also set targets for diversity in job training, contracting, hiring, and accessibility. Implementers seeking to better serve LMI communities can explore examples from this study to expand their focus beyond residential buildings to increase equitable access to energy efficiency throughout communities.

GM’s Siding With Trump Administration Reveals a Lack of Commitment to Clean, Efficient Vehicles;"Despite its constraint refrain about an “all-electric future,” General Motors’ recent siding with the Trump administration reveals a broader unwillingness to commit to steady improvements in fuel economy.
GM joined Fiat Chrysler and Toyota last week in signing onto the Trump administration’s efforts to slam the brakes on vehicle fuel economy and emissions improvements. Earlier, GM fended off intense pressure to follow the example of four automakers—Ford, Honda, VW, and BMW—that forged an agreement with California to ensure continuing reductions in vehicles’ greenhouse gas emissions and to protect states’ right to adopt strong standards.
Perhaps this isn’t surprising. GM was among the worst companies in terms of fuel economy gains in 2012 through 2017. Its fleet-wide fuel economy improved by only 5.5% during that time, falling far short of the improvements made by leaders such as Honda (11.8%). In addition, it announced plans last year to kill most of its car production in favor of SUVs and crossovers.
Pickups tell the story
Full-size pickups, a key market segment, show both progress and stagnation, from Ford’s deployment of efficient EcoBoost engines in the F-150 to Toyota’s indolence with the Tundra – essentially unchanged since 2007. GM could have made strong fuel economy improvements all along. Instead, the automaker appears to have prioritized changing other attributes of its vehicles, as illustrated by its disappointing redesign of full-size pickups for 2019.
When GM first announced the redesigned pickups, we gave it kudos for introducing an all-new, highly advanced four-cylinder turbocharged engine – the first in a modern full-size pickup. We estimated that trucks with this engine would achieve fuel economy gains of 18.5% over the V6 truck they replaced. That would equal a certification fuel economy of nearly 30 miles per gallon (MPG). When the fuel economy numbers came in, however, the truck achieved only 27.3 MPG, and the two V8 powertrains delivered disappointing improvements as well.
Why did these trucks fail to improve fuel economy as much as the technology is capable of? First, the new four-cylinder truck reduces 0-60 acceleration time by nearly one second due to a 9% increase in peak horsepower and 14% increase in torque, along with a reduction in weight. Similarly, while GM claimed a 7% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, it squandered about half of the potential fuel economy gain by delivering an even bigger truck.
This is but one example of GM’s lackadaisical attitude toward fuel economy. It isn’t that the automaker was unable to make fuel economy improvements. Rather, GM simply used the technology to make up for the negative impacts from other changes, such as faster acceleration and an increase in vehicle size. While other automakers are making real improvements to their full-size trucks, GM has delivered only marginal improvements to its customers – a risky move, given that full-size pickups are a hyper-competitive segment that drives the company’s profits.
GM speaks of big aspirations for a future of efficient and exciting electric vehicles, but in the meantime, it is taking a stand against the steady progress toward cleaner vehicles that the industry badly needs to deliver. The automaker is repeating history by taking long-term risks, betting that efficiency improvements are optional. The automaker risks leaving itself ill-equipped to compete in a changing market, as it did before sliding into bankruptcy just over 10 years ago – and every American could end up having to pay for its mistakes once again.

Puerto Rico Poised to Benefit From Energy Efficiency, but Opponents Get the Facts Wrong;"The people of Puerto Rico will soon benefit significantly from an untapped and least-cost energy resource: energy efficiency. Customer efficiency programs lower overall energy bills for residents and businesses, promote local economic development, reduce emissions, and can improve electric system reliability and resilience.  
In coming months, Puerto Rico is scheduled to begin such programs as a result of legislation enacted in April that sets a goal of saving 30% of electricity use by 2040. Unfortunately, opponents of energy efficiency in Puerto Rico have recently gotten the facts wrong, emphasizing the costs while missing the benefits for all customers, and mischaracterizing the programs as conservation ads rather than efficiency programs. 
Benefits outweigh the costs
The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau (PREB), the island’s energy regulator, has developed a $13 million budget for initial programs, to be collected on customer bills beginning this month.  But press coverage on the new charge has been dominated by skeptics who focus only on the effort’s costs and not its benefits.
Efficiency is the least-cost resource compared to more costly electricity generation —on average about 3 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).  By investing in more efficient equipment and appliances in homes and buildings, Puerto Rico can reduce customer energy bills because of lower energy use and the reduced need to build more expensive generating plants to serve these loads.  Efficiency also reduces emissions and boosts local economic development. Its programs are not free but small increases in consumer rates return a much higher share of benefits to all customers.   
Hawaii Energy, for example, has operated such programs for a decade. According to its most recent annual report, efficiency programs will deliver 1.8 billion kWh in lifetime energy savings at a cost of only 2.1 cents per kWh (program levelized cost of saved energy).  The programs drive customer bill savings of $37 million annually, more than $488 million over the life of the measures installed, and will save an estimated equivalent of three million barrels of oil and 1.8 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Efficiency not conservation
Puerto Rico’s legislation envisions substantial reductions in both energy use and peak energy loads through a comprehensive set of efficiency programs that cover a wide range of customers.  For example, Hawaii Energy’s programs provide customer incentives for more efficient water heating and air conditioning, lighting, appliances, and pumps and motors. They cover diverse markets, including single-family homes, multifamily buildings, low-income customers and communities, and businesses. 
Unfortunately, press coverage in Puerto Rico has claimed that the charge will be used “to pay for an advertising campaign on energy efficiency” (see here; in Spanish) and have not mentioned the more substantial set of programs that the legislation envisions.
Next steps
Puerto Rico’s governor has suggested seeking other sources of income such as “collaborative agreements” or federal funds (see here; in Spanish). While such funds might possibly be available for a small program, a comprehensive program that delivers large benefits to customers requires a comprehensive funding source.  And as states around the United States show, customer-funded efficiency programs successfully leverage other sources of funding such as private businesses that can provide their own capital and other financing.
The details of the efficiency programs have yet to be determined because PREB still must choose a third-party program administrator for them. The next step is for regulators, working with PREB stakeholders, to develop a path toward implementation. 
Proposals that focus on funding sources other than customer rates would make this impossible, inhibiting the ability of the new third-party administrator to deliver energy efficiency.  In fact, such as move would be a major setback.  It would lead to higher energy costs, because it would encourage the local electric utility - PREPA - to meet customer’s needs with more expensive resources instead.
Efficiency can play a key role in Puerto Rico’s clean energy future
As Puerto Rico scales up its ambitious and timely plans to modernize its grid with investments in solar and storage, it should ensure that energy efficiency plays a central role as a least-cost solution that directly benefits customers and makes it easier and cheaper to invest in other sources of clean energy.

What’s Next After Lighting? Regional Leaders Offer Diverse Responses;"As federal standards for lighting improve, many utilities and program administrators are looking at their energy efficiency portfolios and wondering “what’s next”? At our recent Energy Efficiency as a Resource conference in Minneapolis, we put that question to leaders from each of the regional energy efficiency organizations or REEOs.
Their answers show the diverse and exciting opportunities to use energy efficiency as a tool to meet the climate challenge. We share some of the themes across technology, policy, and partnerships that emerged and that highlight opportunities to expand efficiency.
Stacey Paradis, Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance; Sue Coakley, Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships; Cyrus Bhedwar, Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance; Todd McAlister, South-Central Partnership for Energy Efficiency as a Resource; Justin Brant, Southwest Energy Efficiency Project; Greg Wikler, California Efficiency + Demand Management Council; Susan Stratton, Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance; Rachel Gold, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Heat pumps for space and water heating
Many of the REEOs cited the residential opportunity for high-efficiency heat pumps for space and water heating when cost-effective and powered by clean electricity. Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance’s executive director Susan Stratton noted the Northwest’s leadership on heat pump water heaters; the region represents only 4% of the total US market for water heating, but 19% of the national heat pump water heater market. We also heard about the opportunity for space heating with heat pumps in multiple regions, especially in new construction and oil and propane conversions. A subsequent panel discussed how to advance the market for efficient fuel switching.
Strategic energy management and industrial energy efficiency
Promising opportunities also extend to the industrial and commercial sectors. Several REEOs highlighted the potential for strategic energy management (SEM), programs that give organizations a structure and methodology to identify and implement projects and maintain practices that save energy. Some REEOs, including the Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships, are supporting regional collaboratives to drive local adoption of SEM programs. Opportunities for savings in the industrial sector go beyond SEM, although Greg Wikler from the California Efficiency + Demand Management Council noted that potential studies often overlook industrial programs. He said we need to better understand and serve industrial customers.
Targeting low- and moderate-income communities
The REEO leaders all noted the importance of delivering programs that serve all customers, regardless of income or location. They cited the particular value of targeting programs to customers with the highest energy burdens, often in rural areas or underserved communities of color. Low-income program offerings are growing in some parts of the Southeast. For example, the Tennessee Valley Authority plans to increase its support for low-income programs offered through local distribution companies. Some states are setting or increasing dedicated efficiency targets to make sure that low-income customers are served; for example, the 2018 New Efficiency New York goals require that the state target at least 20% of its investment in energy efficiency to low- and middle-income customers.
Flexibility, integration, and optimization in energy efficiency offerings
Regional leaders highlighted the need to take energy efficiency to the next level and begin to integrate programs with demand response and other distributed energy resources, enabling the same program to deliver customer and grid benefits. In the Southwest, utilities are looking to increase the savings from existing programs with networked and controlled HVAC and lighting.
Our research shows that most utilities have room to better integrate these offerings, with only five of the top 52 electric utilities by sales currently delivering fully integrated programs. One barrier is conflicting goals and siloes among programs. Sue Coakley of the Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships said NEEP is working to address this challenge by moving toward next-generation energy efficiency resource standards and performance incentives that encourage energy optimization. In contrast, Todd McAlister of the South-Central Partnership for Energy Efficiency as a Resource discussed the importance of making sure that efforts in Texas and Oklahoma focus on energy efficiency, not just load management and demand response.

  New tools for market transformation
Utility programs are not the only tools to deliver energy efficiency savings, and many of the REEOs highlighted the recent market transformation efforts of cities, states, and regions. Stacey Paradis of the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance cited innovative ways to save energy over time, with lifetime goals in Illinois, incentives in Michigan, and efforts to establish cross-region partnerships on market transformation.
With mostly incremental improvements in model building energy codes at International Code Council and ASHRAE over the past six years, leading cities like San Jose are adopting “reach” or “stretch” codes that accelerate local efforts. In Washington DC, New York City, and Washington State, legislatures and city councils are building on benchmarking efforts with a new policy tool to scale savings: building performance standards. These standards set minimum whole-building energy performance targets based on building type and occupancy, requiring changes to the existing building stock.
Of course, utilities can help to support these efforts by encouraging code compliance, providing data and connections to programs for building performance standards. In many places, that will require coordination with governments and support from forward-thinking regulators.
Looking forward
The specific opportunities for energy savings beyond lighting may vary by region, but each REEO leader noted the potential for strong energy efficiency achievement even as lighting falls away as the primary foundation of many efficiency portfolios. We’re encouraged to see regional energy efficiency leaders step up with new program strategies.

The Environment Could Be the Big Winner of Canada’s Election;"Canada’s parliamentary election this week is a big win for energy efficiency and the environment. About two-thirds of voters backed political parties in favor of a carbon tax and other environmental measures, making it easier for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party to enact significant climate and energy legislation.
Climate policy was a top issue. Trudeau defended his Liberal Party’s climate policies, including its backstop carbon tax that began earlier this year and applies to provinces without their own price on emissions. The major opposition party, the Conservatives, made repeal of the carbon tax a cornerstone of its campaign. In 2018 and 2019, opposition to carbon pricing contributed to Conservative provincial victories in Ontario and Alberta among other issues.
The election may spur more energy-saving and climate-friendly policies. Trudeau’s Liberal Party, which is ideologically centrist with a pro-environmental agenda, won the most seats in Parliament but lost its majority. As a result, it will have to compromise with other parties to get bills passed. This is likely to happen with the Bloc Quebecois or the New Democratic Party (NDP), both of which often have even stronger views on environmental protection and are expected to push the Liberals to the left.
A big part of the climate solution in Canada is energy efficiency. According to Efficiency Canada, the Liberal platform promised the following:
Retrofit 1.5 million homes over the next 5 years
A free energy audit for all interested homeowners and landlords
An interest-free loan of up to $40,000 based on the result of the audit
A Net Zero Homes Grant of up to $5,000 to help buyers of newly built homes that are certified zero-emissions
$100 million in skills training, to ensure there are enough qualified workers to keep up with the increased demand for energy audits, retrofits, and net-zero home construction
Mandatory ENERGY STARÒ certification for all new home appliances, as of 2022
A national competition to create four $100-million, long-term funds to help attract private capital for deep retrofits of large buildings such as office towers
Under a new minority government, supported by the NDP or Bloc, the Liberals could even go a step further and begin to phase out subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, a promise they made in 2015.
Climate and energy are very important in Canada. In 2016, Canada had the fourth highest per-capita carbon dioxide emissions in the world (right behind the US), and 9th highest overall emissions. And like other northern regions, Canada has experienced a higher rate of warming than most other regions of the world. The escalating carbon tax, started by the Liberals in 2018, is estimated to reduce emissions by 50 to 60 million tonnes in 2022 (yes, that’s Canadian “tonnes” — they’re a bit bigger than American tons). And the Liberals have pledged to develop a pathway to zero emissions by 2050, which was also a key promise of the NDP.
With the Liberal Party’s new mandate, the Canadian government will now hopefully take the necessary action and demonstrate that energy efficiency, economic sustainability, and environmental stewardship are all possible at the same time.

How Well Are We Tracking the Health Impacts of Energy Efficiency Programs?;"In-home energy efficiency programs can do a lot to improve people’s health, especially for vulnerable families. A disproportionately high number of low-income households and families of color live in inadequate housing conditions and suffer from chronic diseases exacerbated by these conditions, both of which can be mitigated by in-home energy-saving programs.
In a new report, released today, ACEEE looks at 63 efficiency programs across the United States that are attempting to track health outcomes. We find these programs have no standardized method or level of rigor to track health outcomes and, on average, track only four or five of the nearly two dozen health indicators we identified.
Most programs that we surveyed do initial home audits and post-intervention assessments, but they vary considerably in how and what they track, according to our report, Protecting the Health of Vulnerable Populations with In-Home Energy Efficiency: A Survey of Methods for Demonstrating Health Outcomes.
Better tracking is needed, because homes can have a big impact on our health. In-home efficiency programs can improve housing conditions, reduce exposure to extreme temperatures, air pollution, mold, and pests, and strengthen the financial security of vulnerable families. They can also address basic safety measures such as handrails and include smoke, radon and carbon monoxide detectors — measures that save lives.
However, knowledge and technical gaps between energy- and health-sector advocates still pose a significant barrier to action. By documenting health outcomes, program administrators are better positioned to form cross-sector partnerships with hospitals and other health care providers. They may also be able to unlock new sources of funding earmarked for preventive health care measures. Program administrators could take a number of steps to better assess and communicate the health impacts of their efforts, including adopting a set of standards or a framework for decision making about what information to collect and how to report it.
This report highlights some important steps, but there is more program administrators could be doing to protect public health. In the coming months, ACEEE will provide new research and technical support to help communities, policymakers, and health and environmental advocates build cross-sector partnerships and incorporate best-practice program design.
We also welcome you to attend our second Conference on Health, Environment, and Energy in New Orleans this January. The event will recognize successes from programs across the nation and bring together innovative thought leaders to explore topics of equity, funding, program design, climate change and more.

Climate Change – ‘The Cause of Our Lifetime:’ Opening Remarks From EER;"How can energy efficiency help mitigate climate change? This topic got top billing at last week’s 2019 National Conference on Energy Efficiency as a Resource in Minneapolis. The 400-plus attendees discussed cutting-edge efficiency policies, programs, and technologies, as well as decarbonization, electrification, resilience, and grid-interactive efficient buildings.
The conference opened with speeches from Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, whose city placed fourth in ACEEE’s 2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard, Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, whose state ranked eighth in our 2019 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, and Patti Poppe, president and CEO of CMS Energy and Consumers Energy.
Here are some inspirational excerpts from their opening remarks.
  Jacob Frey, Minneapolis Mayor:
I don’t need to get up here and tell you about the crisis we have on our hands in regards to [climate change]. These are scary times, and scary times require bold action.
We don’t want to just be ahead of the curve in Minneapolis, we want to help set the curve, and we are doing a lot of work in that direction. 46,191 Minnesotans work in the energy efficiency sector in local, well-paying, cutting-edge jobs. Three in every four energy jobs in Minnesota are in energy efficiency…
The environmental impact is just one piece of the puzzle; there are economic, social, and health impacts that are going to impact us daily. Minneapolis is the city that is the second most impacted by climate change in the entire country…We are seeing our winters change…It used to be that the thaw would take place over like a month, but now it takes place over the span of a day or two. This means that we have all the snow and rain draining into the sewer system and heading to the Mississippi —and by the way, our sewer system was made in many cases about a hundred years ago, and to accommodate a significantly lower population and lower population density than what we have now. We’re talking about millions of dollars we need to spend to figure out how to deal with all this water all at once.
Minneapolis is not unique in that perspective, but we are taking significant actions to change the game. We’ve got the goal to get to 100% clean and renewable electricity in our whole city by 2030. But we’re not stopping there. We want to make sure that we’re as energy efficient as possible. We’re doing several things in that regard. In February we passed comprehensive energy benchmarking and disclosure policies. This includes time of sale and time of rent energy disclosure inquiries as well as expanding benchmarking to include residential buildings.
We’re not stopping there, either. It is really good environmental policy to live in a city, but people don’t think that way. If you’re living 45 minutes away in the suburbs in a single-family home, you have a 45- minute commute in a machine. And you’re spending more time and carbon heating your home, which is not linked to any other homes. That has a really significant impact on the environment. We in Minneapolis, like many other cities, have a long legacy of setting up our zoning policy to exclusively allow single family home in chunks of the city. It’s not energy efficient, it’s not economical, and it’s not good for equity either. The conclusion is that we get rid of single-family exclusive zones in our city. That’s not outlawing single family homes, that just saying that in addition to putting up single-family homes you can also put up something more affordable and more environmentally sustainable…
Smarter energy use reduces the emissions that hurt our health, pollute our air, and hurt our climate. This work starts now. I know that all of you have a sense of urgency, and I want to tell you that Minneapolis is in partnership with you in leaning into that controversy and getting something done that is going to quite simply improve people’s lives and save our planet.
Peggy Flanagan, Minnesota Lieutenant Governor
Thank you ACEEE for hosting your conference here in Minnesota. In this state, we really recognize the importance of creating energy efficiency... Almost 15% of Minnesota’s electricity demand is met by energy-efficient manners, about the same as natural gas and a little less than wind. Minnesota continues to rank in the top 10 for our energy efficiency programs, and I certainly would like to get closer to number one while I am in office.
Because our utilities are running great programs, efficiency has met all our growth in electric energy demand since 2007. Minnesota’s economy is more than 30% larger in 2019 than it was in 2007, but we use the same amount of electricity and I think that is pretty exciting. This is huge, and our energy efficiency programs are the reason why we are so productive with our energy consumption.
Governor Walz and I believe that we are in a crisis when it comes to climate and it is our goal and our responsibility to do everything possible while we’re in office to turn the curve on this issue. We’ve introduced the One Minnesota path to clean energy. One of the three parts of this legislation is our new energy efficiency framework, which we call energy optimization. This allows us to increase efficiency and incorporate beneficial fuel switching into our programs. This will open up opportunities for electric vehicles and a number of new technologies to reduce emissions and be more efficient throughout our economy.
I know all of us have a personal story about why this work is important to us… Like so many of us, I am a parent of a child with asthma. I am fortunate enough to be able to access the healthcare needed so that she can have the medications to be able to run and play and life a healthy life, but as the mayor mentioned earlier, this is also an issue about equity, and many of the communities that are impacted by carbon emissions have less access to the things that can help mitigate the health issues…
As we continue to do this work and move boldly to the future around clean energy, let us hold on to the people, and to the narratives and the stories as to why we get up and do this work every single day as the motivator for all of us into the future.
Patti Poppe, President and CEO of Consumers Energy
You are doing amazing work across the country, and I hope to embolden you to do more, because as the Minneapolis mayor said, this is the cause of our lifetime and we have the opportunity through energy efficiency to absolutely help save the planet…
Our commitment to the planet runs very deep. We have pushed ourselves as a company to be leaders in this area. We believe that climate change is happening, and that we have an obligation to take actions to prevent the two-degree scenario from materializing. I’d like to think that we can be leaders and push and make a difference. We’ve got work to do! There’s no time to stand on the sideline and think that somebody else is going to do something about this. That is why I thought of all of you — all of you are doing something about this. All of you are taking your God-given talent, skills, and capabilities to work together and save the planet. It’s part of the reason why we are leading an energy transformation we can be proud of…
We have prevented building a power plant in Michigan because of our energy efficiency programs, and saved Michigan customers 2.5 billion dollar in energy costs at the same time. It’s fantastic… [Energy efficiency] is the leader, it is the thing that people should start with. People ask me all the time, “Should I be putting solar panels on my roof?” And I say, “No. Use less energy. Call us, let us come do a home audit, because we can shape the energy use curve before we have to build something… We’ve doubled the size of our energy efficiency program now in Michigan. We want 2% annual energy efficiency savings from electricity every year because of this, because if we can reduce our usage while we are retiring plants we can fundamentally—and it could not be more urgent—we can reduce the number of plants that we have the build …
The cleanest and cheapest kilowatt is the one we never use…People say close your plants faster, but if I closed my plants faster I would have to build new ones today. We actually need the time to implement demand savings. We have got to reduce people’s energy waste and we can but that is what is required to actually prevent building three new power plants in Michigan. That is the challenge, that is the opportunity.
We’re asking people to join the movement. You guys are part of the movement, you’re leading the movement, and I get that I’m singing to the choir here… but we can’t do it by ourselves. We need more innovation, more implementation, more technology, more savings. We just have to keep pushing, pushing, pushing, and helping people eliminate that waste.
Someday, I imagine being in the garden with one of my grandchildren… and she’s going to look up at me... and say, “Grandma, what’s climate change?” And I’m going to be able to look at her and say that…. it’s something that we used to worry about…
It is not an exaggeration to say that you are saving this planet for future generations. Please work harder, go faster, do more, and we’re going to make this happen. This is our potential. [Quoting Greek proverb:] A society grows great when people plant trees whose shade they shall never know.

Where Can Electrification Do Most to Cut Emissions? Transportation;"The transportation sector offers the greatest potential to slash greenhouse gas emissions through electrification— more even than buildings or industry, according to a recent ACEEE study and four other reports.
Research increasingly cites the electrification of vehicles, buildings, and factories as a key strategy for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change (e.g., see here). In a recent report, ACEEE found that electrification accounted for 35% of the emissions reductions that would come from halving US energy use with energy efficiency measures. Transportation delivered the lion’s share of electrification’s emissions cuts — a whopping 72%.
Other studies have also estimated the electrification opportunity in major sectors of the economy, identifying transportation as having the largest potential. This consensus finding underscores the need to emphasize transportation, notably electric vehicles, in electrification efforts.  
Three of the studies look at greenhouse gas emissions reductions from electrification, finding that transportation accounts for 44-72% of the total emissions reduction. Two other studies look at electrification in terms of increased electric load, with transportation accounting for 55-80% of the impact. Transportation electrification includes both electric passenger vehicles and electric medium and heavy trucks; in the ACEEE study, two-thirds of the transportation opportunity is in light vehicles and the other third is in medium and heavy vehicles.
Electrification opportunities in buildings and industry are also substantial and worth attention. Across the five studies, industry accounted for about one-fifth of the impact and the commercial and residential sectors for about one-tenth each. Results by study are illustrated in the figure below, with further details in a table below.
Allocation of Electrification Impacts by Sector in Five Studies
In considering these figures, bear in mind that these are all national averages, and in some local areas the relative opportunity between sectors will vary.
Efficiency and electrification
Energy efficiency and electrification can often happen in tandem, because electric vehicles, heat pumps and industrial electro-technologies (e.g., induction heating and ultraviolet curing) are often more efficient than conventional equipment. In addition, energy efficiency can and should be used to shrink loads, reducing needed investments at both the customer level (e.g., a smaller heat pump generally costs less than a large one) and the grid level (e.g., with lower loads, the need for transmission and distribution enhancements is reduced).
Differences among the studies
While results across the five studies are broadly similar, several studies have outlier values that are worth exploring. For example, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimates a particularly high opportunity in the residential sector, because it assumes that by 2050 nearly all homes will be electrified (95%). It also credits electrification first before considering energy efficiency, showing a larger electrification share than if loads are first reduced with energy efficiency. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is particularly low on the industrial opportunity because, given the complexity and more limited understanding of electrification opportunities in industry, it took a conservative approach on which processes could be electrified. And its residential percentage is lower than that in the other studies, because it looked at changes in electric loads and includes use of heat pumps to replace electric resistance heat, which reduces electricity use while saving energy and preventing emissions from power generation.
Despite their differences, all of these studies find a substantial opportunity to reduce emissions through electrification, particularly in the transportation sector. Any by combining energy efficiency and electrification, the benefits can be magnified. As our Halfway There study found, efficiency, including substantial electrification, can halve US energy use and greenhouse emissions by 2050.

ACEEE and 525-plus groups celebrate Energy Efficiency Day;"Statement by Steven Nadel, ACEEE’s executive director
Happy Energy Efficiency Day! For this fourth annual event, we hope you join us in shouting out the transformative benefits of saving energy. Energy efficiency — the heart of a clean energy future — can halve energy use and emissions by 2050 and get the United States halfway to its climate goals. Plus, it saves Americans billions of dollars each year on utility bills, supports at least 2.3 million direct jobs, and, by avoiding power plant emissions, cleans our air and prevents 30,000 asthma cases each year.
More than 525 organizations, government agencies, companies, universities, and utilities are participating in today’s event —#EEDay2019. The US Senate and at least two dozen cities, counties, and states have issued official proclamations recognizing October 2, 2019 as Energy Efficiency Day, including Boston, California, Chicago, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, DC, and Wisconsin.
Across the United States, states and cities are taking leadership on energy efficiency, as shown in yesterday’s release of our 2019 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard and in our newly expanded 2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard. They are adopting energy-saving rules for buildings, appliances, and vehicles, some of which counter federal rollbacks of efficiency standards.
We can all do more to save energy in our everyday lives, such as turning off lights when leaving a room or replacing old light bulbs with LEDs. (See consumer tips on ACEEE’s SmarterHouse.org). We welcome your participation in Energy Efficiency Day, which is hosted by regional and national groups, including the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Our goal: raise public awareness about energy efficiency — the cheapest, quickest way to meet our energy needs and reduce heat-trapping emissions. It is the superhero our planet needs.

50-State Scorecard Reveals States Are Ramping Up Clean Energy;"States push building codes, appliance standards; MD improves most; NY joins MA, CA, RI, VT in Top 5
Washington, DC — A rising number of states are showing US leadership on clean energy by adopting ambitious goals and energy-saving rules for buildings, appliances, and vehicles, according to the 2019 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, released today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. This 13th annual report identifies the leaders – Massachusetts and California; the most-improved states, notably Maryland; the states that lost ground such as Kentucky; and those lagging behind, including North Dakota and Wyoming.
The 50-state Scorecard reveals increasing state commitment to energy efficiency, the least-expensive clean energy resource, even in places where it had traditionally been overlooked.  Nevada, New Mexico, Washington, New York, and Maine passed 100% clean energy goals, along with plans to increase efficiency investment. A record number of states adopted new efficiency standards for a variety of products and equipment, some in direct response to the federal rollback of standards for light bulbs. States have also countered the federal plan to weaken vehicle efficiency by promoting electric vehicles and adopting California’s vehicle emissions standards, which now face a precarious future.
“State leadership on energy efficiency is more important than ever for ushering in the low-carbon future we need,” said ACEEE executive director Steve Nadel. “If states embrace robust energy-saving measures nationwide, Americans can slash greenhouse gas emissions by 50% and deliver more than $700 billion in energy savings by 2050. We commend the top states for their clean energy leadership and urge states that are lagging to implement the strategies laid out in this report so they can deliver energy and cost savings for their residents.”
The scorecard, which ranks states on 33 metrics in six policy areas, found that some states are moving backward but most are stepping forward:
Maryland improved the most since the 2018 Scorecard, moving up three spots to seventh place and gaining 4.5 (out of a possible total 50) points. The state made significant gains by focusing on utility efficiency programs, stronger building energy codes, public transit funding, and electric vehicle adoption. Hawaii also improved considerably, gaining 2.5 points, thanks in part to a new law that sets efficiency standards for products not covered at the federal level, including computers, faucets, and showerheads.
Massachusetts ranked first for the ninth year in a row. Earlier this year, its regulators approved a new three-year efficiency plan with expanded programs that aim to reduce statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 80% by 2050. California, a close second, remains a national leader, setting tailpipe emissions and appliance standards that other states have adopted. Rounding out the top 10 are Rhode Island, Vermont, New York, Connecticut, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington.
New York and New Jersey are states to watch because of their robust clean energy goals and focus on efficiency. Their utilities and regulators continue to strengthen efficiency programs to meet new savings targets approved last year. New York adopted one of the most aggressive US climate targets, aiming to slash energy consumption 185 trillion Btu by 2025 and achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. New Jersey, which officially rejoined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in June, has a first-of-its-kind state partnership to promote electric vehicles.
Ohio, in contrast, fell in the rankings. It enacted a law this year that attempts to save the state’s aging power plants but guts energy efficiency and renewable energy standards. This is particularly disappointing because prior ACEEE research found that Ohio was one of the states with the most health benefits to gain from efficiency standards, which could save it up to $1.6 billion in avoided health impacts.
Kentucky fell the furthest in the rankings, dropping from #29 to #38 and losing 4.5 points, due to a 2018 decision that discontinued most of the consumer-facing management programs for a key state utility, Kentucky Power. Other utilities in the state have also seen major cuts to their program funding.
From coast to coast, states are taking concerted effort to promote electric vehicles, efficient products, smart buildings, cold climate heat pumps, and zero-energy building codes:
Appliance standards. Four states — Washington, Colorado, Hawaii, and Nevada — adopted new laws to require products to meet minimum energy efficiency standards, and an additional six states and Washington, DC, filed similar bills. The standards passed this year are expected to save consumers hundreds of millions of dollars on their utility bills. The laws in Washington, Colorado, and Nevada include provisions to keep the federal light bulb standards that the US government has announced it will roll back.
Building energy codes and performance standards. States continue to update and strengthen codes for residential and commercial buildings. Since the publication of the 2018 International Energy Conservation Code, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Illinois, and Ohio have adopted the updated codes and numerous other states are considering adopting them as well. Nebraska, which had not updated its building codes since 2009, now has the strongest codes in the Midwest. Some states are also moving toward building performance standards for existing commercial buildings.  For example, this year Washington passed HB 1257, calling for energy use intensity targets for commercial buildings exceeding 50,000 square feet.
Vehicle efficiency. Thirteen states plus the District of Columbia have adopted California’s strict vehicle emissions standards, which the US government recently announced it will no longer allow. Colorado is the most recent state to adopt these standards, finalizing its rule in November 2018. Nine states, including Massachusetts, Oregon, and Vermont as well as Washington, DC have also adopted its Zero Emission Vehicle programs, as well as overall goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled and the resulting emissions.
Energy-saving targets. Several states, including Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Nevada have renewed, extended, or strengthened energy efficiency targets for utilities and statewide programs to lay the groundwork for future savings.
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said: “Our administration is proud that Maryland continues to be a national leader for energy efficiency. Our initiative to reduce energy consumption in state-owned buildings by 10 percent is just one of the many ways Maryland is leveraging energy efficiency measures to cut carbon emissions, save money, and improve the environment."" 
The Scorecard awards a total of 50 points based on state policies and programs in six areas: utilities, buildings, transportation, state government, combined heat and power, and appliance standards. It highlights best practices for promoting energy efficiency, typically the lowest-cost way to meet customers’ energy needs.  Such efficiency improves air and water quality, strengthens grid resilience, promotes equity, improves health and comfort, and helps address the climate challenge

Saluting Tom Eckman: an IRP legend announces retirement;"Ask just about anyone involved in the utility energy efficiency industry where the best utility system integrated resource planning (IRP) is conducted, and they’ll say it’s the Pacific Northwest. And ask anyone familiar with that work what name comes to mind in connection with that effort, and it’s Tom Eckman.
Tom is the Director of the Power Division of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, and has been a key figure in the history of electric resource planning in the Northwest, literally from its inception. He testified before Congress and helped produce the Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act of 1980. Among other things, that “Power Act” had the prescient and critically important effect of enshrining in federal law the concept that energy efficiency is an electric system resource. That act has been the foundation of electric system planning in the Northwest ever since, and Tom has been centrally involved every step of the way.
Going out on a high note
Tom recently directed completion of the Seventh Northwest Power Plan, and having crossed that finish line, announced his impending retirement on July 1st.  This blog post is a tribute to Tom, and an acknowledgment of his invaluable contributions to the field.
If there is one image that best represents Tom’s work, it is perhaps the now iconic graph of projected resource additions needed over the planning period covered in the power plan. Each of the last four plans (conducted every 5 years) has found that the energy efficiency resource would meet nearly all projected load growth for the following 20 years. The figure below shows resource additions called for in the latest plan.
Seventh Power Plan Resource Portfolio (resources to be added over the planning period)
That pattern has been so similar across multiple plans that I’ve teased Tom that he just prints the same graph from a mimeograph machine every five years.
In all seriousness, the depth of analysis the planners in the Northwest engage in is exceptional.  They thoroughly examine over two dozen different scenarios to analyze the effects of different market conditions and policy configurations on future resource choices. For a quick overview of the most recent plan, one might want to peruse this presentation.
Putting a plan into action
And what is perhaps most noteworthy is the success that the Northwest has had turning the “on paper” planning analyses into concrete action and measurable results. The cumulative effects of this work has been truly impressive. By 2012 energy efficiency had become the second largest electric resource in the Northwest, trailing only hydropower, and exceeding all other resources such as coal, natural gas, and wind. And energy efficiency’s share continues to grow. The Pacific Northwest provides an outstanding example of resource planning and implementation that all states and regions should study carefully.
I want to thank Tom for being such an effective spokesperson for IRP and for energy efficiency as a legitimate resource. I personally have called on him more often than anyone has a right to for our Energy Efficiency as a Resource conferences, most recently for a 2015 keynote speech. Tom has a wonderful ability to combine critically important technical content with humorous and entertaining delivery and has played a huge role in advancing this field over the decades.
So here’s to the Johnny Appleseed of IRP: Happy trails, and may you find the least-cost, low-risk, maximum benefit path to optimize your retirement.
THANKS TOM!!!! (And don't think we won't call on you for future contributions.)

"Putting a Price on Carbon Is Not Easy; Energy Efficiency Can Help";"Carbon pricing has gained ground worldwide but has also drawn increased pushback in recent years, becoming a political issue, as illustrated in the current Canadian election. To accelerate its success, more evaluations are needed to understand the economic impacts of existing policies and the promising role of energy efficiency.
Economists routinely recommend putting a price on heat-trapping carbon emissions as a primary strategy to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change. But for all this attention, a key question too often gets overlooked: how can carbon pricing encourage more energy efficiency, which can halve carbon emissions? Carbon pricing can encourage efficiency in two ways: it makes the economics of efficiency more favorable by raising energy prices; and often provides funds to invest in efficiency programs.
According to the World Bank, 57 carbon pricing initiatives have been adopted globally —six more jurisdictions than a year ago, covering about 20% of global emissions. Such pricing is particularly common in Europe. In North America, 13 states and provinces have carbon pricing in place, with a national backstop in place in Canada for provinces without their own carbon price. Many of these initiatives began years ago; the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) began in 2009, a carbon tax in British Columbia in 2008, and the California cap and trade program in 2013.
Despite some recent forward momentum, carbon pricing is facing political challenges in Canada, as well as in Washington state, Oregon, Australia, and the US Congress.  
Climate is a major issue in Canada’s election
Our neighbor to the north is in the midst of a parliamentary election, with votes to be cast on October 21, 2019. Climate policy is perhaps the number one issue, with the Liberal Party of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau defending its climate policies, including the backstop carbon tax it began earlier this year, and the major opposition party, the Conservatives, making repeal of the carbon tax a cornerstone of its campaign (party positions are discussed here). In 2018 and 2019, opposition to carbon pricing contributed to Conservative provincial victories in Ontario and Alberta among other issues. Since those elections, Ontario has repealed its cap and trade program and Alberta has eliminated its carbon tax.
Carbon tax gets tested in Australia
Australia is another case in point. There, the left-of-center Labor Party established a carbon tax in 2012, and the tax was a central part of the right-of-center Liberal Party’s successful effort to take control in the 2014 election. After taking office in 2014, the Liberal Party quickly repealed the carbon tax. Climate policy was again a major issue in the 2019 election, with Labor emphasizing climate change (but this time, climate policies instead of a carbon tax) and the Liberals focusing on the economy. Ultimately the economy proved more decisive, particularly in coal regions.
US challenges stymy carbon pricing
Several US states have faced similar challenges. In Washington state, two citizens’ initiatives to establish a carbon tax were defeated. One offset the revenue from the carbon tax with a reduction in the state sales tax, while the other spent much of the revenue on climate mitigation and adaptation measures, including energy efficiency. These defeats appear to stem partly from concerns about both the economic impact of a carbon tax and disagreements about what to do with the revenue raised — trying to find the sweet spot between returning some funds to taxpayers and also spending some of the funds on energy efficiency and other programs to address climate change.
Following the 2018 defeat, Governor Jay Inslee and the state legislature approved targeted legislation this year, including bills to establish performance requirements for existing commercial buildings, phase out electric generation that emits carbon dioxide by 2045, and encourage electric vehicles. Another piece of 2019 legislation established minimum energy efficiency requirements on 17 products.
Likewise, in Oregon, a Democratic governor and legislative leaders united earlier this year in favor of a cap and trade program. However, united opposition by the Republican party and hesitation by a few Democratic senators halted the bill just before the legislature adjourned. The governor and legislative leaders hope to pass a bill next year.
And in the US Congress, a cap and trade program passed the House during the Obama administration but couldn’t get enough votes in the Senate. Since then, various carbon tax bills have been introduced, but none have gained momentum. To date few Congressional Republicans have been willing to support carbon pricing.
Efficiency can help make the case
While opposition to carbon pricing has grown in the United States and Canada, some progress has been made. The Canadian carbon tax backstop went into effect this year, and New Jersey is on a path to participate in RGGI beginning in 2020; Virginia may also join RGGI if control of the state legislature flips this November. In the Northeast United States, nine states and Washington, DC, are planning for a regional cap and invest program for transportation fuels, with completion of the policy design process targeted for the end of this year.
For carbon pricing to accelerate, however, more effort is needed to address concerns. Only some carbon pricing policies have been evaluated, and while evaluation results are generally positive (see here and here), more evaluation is needed on the impact of carbon pricing on the economy. Evaluations to date generally show that carbon pricing does modestly reduce emissions, but the larger impacts are often from associated policies such as energy efficiency programs funded with carbon price revenues or from adopting complementary policies as Washington state did this year. For example, a Duke University analysis found that RGGI’s spending on energy efficiency was an important reason for its emissions reductions after controlling for other factors.  
RGGI may show the path forward. It uses the majority of collected revenue to fund energy efficiency programs, and as a result, it provided $1.4 billion in net economic benefits over the 2015-2017 period, according to a recent evaluation. This impressive return on investment turns economic concerns on their head and suggests energy efficiency could be the key for helping carbon pricing succeed.

Rural Households Spend Much More of Their Income on Energy Bills than Others;"Hardest-hit groups are low-income households and those in the East and Southeast; energy efficiency can help
WASHINGTON, D.C.— Rural households across the United States spend a disproportionately high share of their income on energy bills — about 40% more than their metropolitan counterparts, according to a new report released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) and the Energy Efficiency for All (EEFA) coalition. The problem is most glaring in the East and Southeast, and among low-income households across all regions.
Overall, rural households have a median energy burden — the percentage of a household’s income spent on home energy bills for needs such as air conditioning, heating, lighting, appliances, and cooking — of 4.4%, which is one-third higher than the national burden. Those with low incomes have a median energy burden of 9%, which is almost three times that of higher-income counterparts. In several rural regions, this burden exceeds 15% for one of every four low-income households. In addition to income level, other factors may increase energy burdens, including a home’s physical condition, a household’s ability to invest in energy-efficient equipment and upgrades, and the availability of efficiency programs and incentives that put energy-saving technologies within reach.
Other rural residents hit particularly hard include elderly, nonwhite, and renting households, as well as those living in multifamily and manufactured homes. The East South Central, New England, and Mid-Atlantic regions have the highest median rural energy burdens, at 5.1%.
But with the right policies and initiatives, those with high energy burdens could see some relief. Energy efficiency upgrades can lessen these energy burdens by as much as 25%, resulting in more than $400 in annual energy bill savings for some households.
  The report, The High Cost of Energy in Rural America: Household Energy Burdens and Opportunities for Energy Efficiency, is the first to focus on the energy burdens shouldered by those living in rural America. It builds on a previous report, Lifting the High Energy Burdens in America’s Largest Cities: How Energy Efficiency Can Improve Low-Income and Underserved Communities.
Appalachian Voices and Prosperity Now joined ACEEE and EEFA in today’s release of the report. A recording of the media call will be available on ACEEE’s YouTube page.
ACEEE and EEFA will also hold a webinar at 1:00 PM EDT on Wednesday, July 25, to discuss the high energy burdens faced by rural Americans, as well as key findings from the report.
”High energy costs can place a significant financial burden on rural families, forcing them to make difficult trade-offs between paying energy bills and buying food or medicine,"" said Lauren Ross, local policy program director at ACEEE and lead report author. “Compounding the issue, many low- to moderate-income families live in homes that need repairs or improvements to meet basic health and safety standards. Energy efficiency upgrades help to lower energy bills for these families, while also mitigating indoor health risks that can contribute to cases of asthma, respiratory problems, heart disease, arthritis, and rheumatism.”
“It’s unfortunate that rural Americans are bearing such a large energy burden, but the good news is that with the right programs and support from utilities and others, energy efficiency can go a long way toward solving this problem,” said Khalil Shahyd, senior policy advocate with the Resilient Communities program at the Natural Resources Defense Council where he works with the Energy Efficiency for All coalition. “It also makes homes more comfortable and avoids the power plant emissions that dirty our air, harm our health, and warm our climate.”
“Excessive energy costs are a major problem in Appalachia, where the country’s deepest rural poverty persists despite the region’s long history of energy production,” said Tom Cormons, executive director of Appalachian Voices. “Unfortunately, utilities serving the region are way behind when it comes to making smart investments in energy efficiency. It’s time for Appalachia to benefit not just from lower energy costs, but also the jobs and economic growth that energy efficiency investments can achieve in concert with solar development and other sustainable economic initiatives.”
“By embracing energy-efficient construction and rehabilitation, and properly valuing it as part of mortgage underwriting, we could expand homeownership and reduce homeownership costs, enhance home appreciation and improve financial outcomes for rural families,” said Doug Ryan, senior director for affordable homeownership at Prosperity Now.
Energy efficiency programs that address high energy burdens can also provide benefits beyond energy savings, including education and employment opportunities, economic development, and improved public health. Energy efficiency can effecively and equitably be brought to rural communities by expanding current low-income program offerings, exploring no- and low-risk efficiency financing options, incorporating regional workforce development initiatives, and building relationships with other area service providers to strengthen program delivery.
These programs will need expanded resources and improved design and targeting to ensure their success and long-term energy affordability. With the proper resources, design, and implementation, not only will rural households benefit from greater access to energy efficiency investments, but so will entire communities.
Rural households make up roughly 16% of all US households and are spread across 72% of the nation’s land area. Three-quarters of rural homes are single-family units. In some regions, more than 20% of rural households live in manufactured housing. About a quarter of all rural households are renters, the majority of them in single-family housing.

Report and Webinar: US States Lead on Energy Efficiency in 2019;"As we head into the final stretch of 2019, clear leaders have emerged in this year’s race to slash energy waste in pursuit of a clean energy future. From coast to coast, US states have been setting the pace on everything from appliance standards to reducing vehicle emissions to saving energy in the buildings sector.
Next Tuesday, ACEEE will release the 13th edition of the State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, an annual ranking of all 50 US states and the District of Columbia on their policies and progress. The report highlights best practices of leading states and captures the latest updates in a year that has seen a particularly strong surge in state-level activity.
At a webinar on Tuesday, October 1st at 11 am ET, we will highlight results, along with comments from Commissioner Judith Judson, Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, and Chris Rice, Maryland Energy Administration.

Many state lawmakers have doubled down on their commitment to chart a course to a zero-carbon economy, and are using energy efficiency as a core strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across multiple sectors, including utilities, buildings, transportation, and industry. Saving energy not only reduces heat-trapping emissions but also creates more jobs, lowers utility bills, and cleans the air we breathe.
One exciting story this year is the remarkable number of states raising the bar on their clean energy goals. Five states — Nevada, New Mexico, Washington, New York, and Maine — joined California and Hawaii in passing bills this year that set 100% clean energy targets. In most cases, these states are planning to use energy efficiency more to reach their goals, setting stronger targets for utility-sector energy savings and focusing on innovative policies such as energy standards for existing buildings.
This was also a landmark year for the adoption of state-level appliance standards. Four states adopted new standards that set minimum energy efficiency requirements for appliances and equipment. Many states also worked to codify existing federal lighting standards, ensuring that consumers will continue to see savings from more efficient light bulbs even as federal standards are rolled back.
Similarly, states have focused their ambitions on more efficient vehicles and transit systems. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have joined California in adopting clean car rules.
These are just a few of the important updates and highlights from what’s been one of the most spirited years for state-level efforts to cut energy waste in recent history. To learn more about how your state performed in the 2019 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, tune in for ACEEE’s webinar on Tuesday, October 1st at 11 am ET, when we’ll present and discuss the findings.

Efficiency Makes Clean Energy Cost-competitive With New Gas Power Plants;"Clean energy, including wind, solar, storage, energy efficiency, and demand flexibility, has reached an economic tipping point and is now cost-competitive with natural gas power generation, according to a new study by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI). Dig into the report’s findings, and you’ll see that energy efficiency and demand flexibility play an outsized role. The study finds that including these least-cost, demand-side resources more than triples the near-term market for clean energy to replace new gas power plants.   
Across the United States, utilities and energy developers have announced plans to spend about $70 billion building new natural gas power plants. RMI finds that clean energy portfolios (CEPs) are lower cost than 90% of the proposed gas capacity. It concludes that these planned investments in new gas power plants are at significant risk of becoming stranded assets or obsolete. CEPs present an alternative to new gas power plants and can deliver both large cost savings and emissions reductions.

The outsized role of efficiency and demand flexibility
The RMI analysis, The Growing Market for Clean Energy Portfolios, finds that energy efficiency and demand flexibility each deliver about one-fifth, or 40% combined, of the energy capacity needed to avoid new combined cycle gas turbines in the US. The opportunity for demand-side resources is even higher in some regions — more than 50% in the Midwest and West and more than 40% in the Northeast/MidAtlantic.
Energy efficiency is also important for avoiding new gas combustion turbines, providing a tenth of the capacity needed to avoid all new such turbines. Here, demand flexibility and storage play the largest roles because these turbines primarily provide power during peak hours.
The capacity contributions from demand-side solutions are large, but their cost savings are most striking. While wind, solar, and storage resources would deliver $3.5 billion in customer savings, efficiency and demand flexibility would add another $25.5 billion.
The potential savings from efficiency are large, but will not happen on their own. That’s why we need policy solutions to drive investments in efficiency when and where they’re most needed.
State efficiency policies are needed to make CEPs work
Utilities do not traditionally have the incentive to invest in energy efficiency, but state policies flip the script and can motivate them to do so. Three key policies include next-generation energy efficiency resource standards, utility business model changes (performance incentives and revenue decoupling), and integrated resource planning. 
While states have made progress on these policies, they can still do more to design and scale policies that ensure efficiency delivers the needed savings. Only 27 states currently have long-term efficiency requirements for utilities and a similar number of states have established utility business model changes such as decoupling and/or performance incentives to align utility profit motives with energy efficiency outcomes. While many states conduct integrated resource planning, few fully value the potential contribution of energy efficiency and other clean energy resources.
Recent policy successes can provide a model for others
In the Midwest, where there is large opportunity for clean energy portfolios, we see examples of states that are getting these policies right. Michigan and Minnesota established robust utility efficiency policies and have made improvements in recent years.
Michigan enacted an energy-savings target in 2008. In 2016, it extended electricity savings targets of 1% per year and established a new integrated resource plan process that includes the utilities’ supply-side and demand-side energy capacity. Since 2008, utilities have been able receive performance-based incentives for implementing energy efficiency programs. The 2016 legislation tweaked those incentives. As a result of these comprehensive policies, Consumers Energy developed an ambitious IRP, which ramps up energy efficiency savings to 2.0% of electric retail sales per year. Efficiency is a critical component of the plan, allowing for no new additions of fossil fueled generation over the 20-year planning period and an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions (from 2005 levels) by 2040.
Minnesota enacted its own energy efficiency resource standard (EERS) in 2007, setting electricity saving goals for utilities of 1.5% of retail sales each year. Utilities can earn performance incentives for energy efficiency programs and must file integrated resource plans with the regulatory commission. Xcel Minnesota, the state’s largest utility, has committed to replacing its last two coal plants with a combination of resources, including about 800 megawatts of energy efficiency.
No time to waste
While the opportunity for cost-competitive clean energy has reached a tipping point, much work remains, and we cannot delay. RMI’s analysis finds that ignoring demand-side resources delays the clean energy opportunity by eight years, on average. The chart below shows when clean energy becomes less expensive than new gas; the clean energy portfolios in dark blue on the left include efficiency and demand flexibility while those in light blue on the right (WSS – or wind, solar & storage) exclude these demand-side resources and as a result are not cost competitive for several more years. 
Source: RMI. 2019. The Growing Market for Clean Energy Portfolios
States should move now to enact new efficiency policies or strengthen those already in place, including efficiency resource standards, utility performance incentives, revenue decoupling, and integrated resource planning. 
While many states have established these foundational policies, others have not, and still others such as Iowa and Ohio are rolling back efforts already in place. Even states with successful policies will likely need to scale up existing efforts to deliver the level of savings and emissions reductions identified in the RMI study. The good news is that the foundational policy tools for efficiency have been tested and they work. Now is the time for all hands on deck to prioritize energy efficiency as the heart of a clean energy future.

US Government Takes Sledgehammer to Clean Car Rules;"Washington, DC — In another major setback for US climate policy, President Trump tweeted today that his administration is revoking California’s waiver to set stricter vehicle emissions standards that more than a dozen other states have adopted. For half a century, through eight prior US administrations, California’s standards have led the nation’s push for cleaner cars and light trucks.
Therese Langer, director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy’s (ACEEE) transportation program, said:
“Without California, our cars would be much dirtier today. The Trump administration’s decision defies common sense. It slams the brakes on efforts to ensure automakers produce vehicles that are more efficient each model year. It will cost consumers dearly, forcing them to refill their gas tanks more often and spew more heat-trapping pollution into the air.
“This is a direct attack on US clean air policy that dates back to the founding of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970 when Richard Nixon was president and Ronald Reagan was governor of California. This policy has reduced smog and other harmful air pollution.
“The Trump administration should make a U-turn for the sake of clean air and public health.”
Two federal agencies — the EPA and the Department of Transportation — are expected to issue legal challenges to California’s ability to set greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and light trucks. The EPA is revoking the waiver that allowed California to set standards for model year 2017-2025 vehicles. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have adopted California’s standards, the earliest version of which predated federal rules.
This is the first part of the administration’s dual-pronged attack on clean cars. Another rule is expected later this year to weaken US vehicle standards for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy — the miles-per-gallon average that each automaker must meet.
Rolling back fuel economy standards will do nothing to improve traffic safety, as the administration has claimed, and will instead cost American consumers $460 billion in combined fuel and vehicle costs ($3,300 per vehicle, on average) in the coming years, according to a recent report by Consumer Reports. 
Despite administration claims, ACEEE analysis shows that fuel economy standards have not increased the cost of cars, SUVs, and light trucks. In fact, vehicle prices have remained essentially flat over the past 15 years, even as average fuel economy improved.
Four automakers — Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Honda — rankled the Trump administration this summer by reaching a deal with California that maintains annual reductions in average vehicle emissions. Numerous lawsuits are expected to challenge the revocation of California's waiver, leaving it to the courts to make the final decision.

Energy Efficiency Can Slash Emissions and Get US Halfway to Climate Goals;"Washington DC — As international leaders gather next week to discuss climate action during Climate Week NYC, new research shows that energy efficiency can slash US energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050 and get the United States halfway toward its climate goals.
The report, by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, offers a road map for dramatically reducing energy waste. It identifies ambitious but cost-effective and technically possible measures that would avert emissions of nearly 2,500 million metric tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide — equivalent to all emissions from cars, trucks, homes, and commercial buildings in 2050.
“Energy efficiency is an urgently needed climate solution,” says ACEEE executive director Steven Nadel, a report co-author. “It can deliver swift, robust emissions cuts. We cannot wait to take action. We already see the effects of intensifying climate change and the resulting increase in extreme weather events — from respiratory and other health problems to flooding, drought, heat waves, and wildfires.”
To avoid a climate change catastrophe, long-term strategies have called for reducing total US greenhouse gas emissions by 80–100% by 2050. Prior studies, including by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) found that efficiency measures can produce nearly half of these reductions.
The ACEEE report, Halfway There: Energy Efficiency Can Cut Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Half by 2050, builds on this work by identifying 11 opportunities and related policies to achieve the necessary savings. Transportation, which will see a transition to electric vehicles, would deliver nearly half (46%) of the emissions reductions while buildings would deliver a third and industry a fifth. For energy savings, buildings would deliver 40% of the total, followed by transportation (32%) and industry (27%).
The major opportunities include:
Transportation. A significant shift to electric cars and trucks and continued fuel economy gains under new standards could approximately halve vehicle carbon emissions. Also reducing emissions: less driving in cars and light trucks, improved freight system efficiency, and more-efficient airplanes.
Buildings. New homes and commercial buildings could cut their emissions by 70% with efficient design and use of cleaner electricity. Existing homes and buildings slash emissions with energy-efficient upgrades, smart control technologies, and electrification of heating and cooling. Adding to total emissions cuts are updated efficiency standards for appliances and equipment and growth in the ENERGY STAR® program.
Industry. The industrial sector could deliver hefty emissions cuts with strategic energy management, smart manufacturing, industrial process improvements (including electrification strategies), changes in feedstocks and new process technologies and materials.
“Energy efficiency is indispensable to climate change mitigation,“ says Kathleen Gaffney, co-author of the IEA’s Energy Efficiency 2018 report. “It’s already made an immense difference. Without efficiency measures implemented since 2000, global emissions in 2017 would have been 12% higher.”
Vignesh Gowrishankar, co-author of a related 2017 NRDC report, says energy efficiency is among the least expensive and most effective ways to reduce much of our emissions. “It also improves the cost and effectiveness of other critical solutions such as renewables, electric vehicles, and electric heat pumps,” he adds.
“The good news is that we can start right now by investing more in energy-efficient appliances, buildings, vehicles, and industrial plants,” says Lowell Ungar, ACEEE senior policy advisor and report co-author. “But to achieve maximum emissions reductions, we need political and financial investments that go far beyond business as usual. If we do so, the 2050 payoff will be impressive.”
The report says government policies and programs alone would deliver about $700 billion a year in energy savings by 2050. Plus, the authors note, such investment will create more jobs, boost grid resilience, reduce air pollution, and improve people’s health.
The US government, however, is moving to weaken efficiency standards for light bulbs, appliances and equipment, cars, and trucks. At the same time, more US cities and states are boosting their efficiency and clean energy efforts, though they still have a long way to go.
The report calls for scaling up energy efficiency measures, including:
Rapid upgrades to vehicle standards, building energy codes, equipment efficiency standards, ENERGY STAR specifications, and state energy-savings targets.
Substantial improvements to existing factories, homes, commercial buildings, and the electric grid and better management of energy use in all of them, spurred by government investment and requirements.
More travel options and better management of freight and aviation energy use, including through user fees.
A switch to electric vehicles, equipment, and industrial processes (along with a more efficient and cleaner power sector).
Greater investment in research and development for new efficiency options in every sector, especially improved industrial processes.

The Future of Energy Policy: A Conversation With BECC Keynote Speaker Phil Sharp;"At a time of partisan bickering and talk about the Green New Deal, the politics around energy and climate change can be difficult to navigate. Still, policy change at the federal and state levels has never been more crucial for protecting our environment.
This topic will be central to the upcoming Behavior, Energy & Climate Change (BECC) conference, the premier international conference that explores how human behavior and decision making can accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future.
We discussed the future of energy politics with BECC 2019’s keynote speaker Phil Sharp, a former 20-year member of the US House of Representatives, D-Ind., who served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was a driving force for landmark energy legislation that included the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Sharp is now a fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.
Here are excerpts of our conversation:
What made you care about energy and the environment?
When I came to Congress in 1975, we were in the midst of the so-called oil crisis, which dominated politics for much of the 1970s. Serving on that [House Energy and Commerce] committee got me very engaged in energy policy and the environmental issues that affect energy policy. I served as a Congressman from 1975 to 1995. I was involved in the Clean Air Act of 1990, which lead to my interest in climate change.
When I became president of Resources for the Future [in 2005] there were a number of skilled scholars doing work on a number of environmental issues, particularly about climate change. I have also taught a course on climate and energy policy at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and Georgetown University.
What will it take to build a movement in Congress that tackles climate change?
Tackling climate change is a broad-based proposition. It will take a movement among the American people, it will take a movement among people in business, and of course it will take an environmental movement and a movement at the state level. We’re really on the cusp of action; I anticipate that we are going to see significant federal action soon. It’s already emerging, but most of it will probably come when we have a new presidential administration.
What are your views of the Green New Deal, not just as the progressive wing of the Democratic Party articulates it, but as it may morph into something viable for Congress?
The Green New Deal is really a political manifesto, a set of aspirational goals that are really broad and include many things about society, such as climate change. It is out there, motivating people, but it is certainly not a legislative program that has been introduced to Congress as some kind of resolution. So it stimulates action, but doesn’t define what we should do. The goal of trying to be totally on clean energy by 2030 will probably be very difficult to reach, but the Green New Deal is helping to push us. Now other people have got to define and negotiate a plan of action, but the Green New Deal will not be voted on as a plan of action might be.
The BECC conference brings social science researchers together with governments, utilities, and businesses to act on climate change. What is the value of bringing social science and behavior research into discussions of climate and energy?
There is enormous value to having social scientists involved. It’s very important for social scientists to keep to the integrity of their knowledge and not compromise politically, but it is also important to see what would work in a political context. We must involve social scientists because frankly there’s no point of going through the political and environmental agony of making changes if we’re not doing so based off of scientific reasoning.
Do you have any other message for BECC attendees?
This conference is a very valuable way to update oneself, get ideas, and make new contacts. I am excited to speak to you about federal policy; we are about to make some very significant changes to federal and state policy, and I hope to articulate some trends that might not be as well known. People need to understand that their participation is very crucial to making action happen.

Missed Opportunity: Few Utilities Fully Integrate Energy Efficiency and Demand Response;"In a large missed opportunity to boost power grid flexibility and benefit customers, relatively few US utilities have programs that fully integrate energy efficiency and demand response, according to ACEEE’s robust review of 44 utility filings.
Across the United States, we found 22 utility programs that integrate energy efficiency (EE) and demand response (DR) to some degree, but only five fully integrate them into a single program. Such integration can help grid operators meet customer demand reliably and at low cost, especially as more renewable resources enter the grid.
Because EE and DR can be complementary, many experts and organizations have long recognized the benefits of integrating them into single customer offerings. Energy efficiency programs focus on reducing energy waste by improving overall energy performance, while demand response programs incentivize customers to reduce or shift power demand at specific times.
We will discuss our new report and related topics at our upcoming National Conference on Energy Efficiency as a Resource next month in Minneapolis. Register today to avoid late fees, which kick in tomorrow.

Growing need for a more flexible grid
As our electric utility system evolves, there is an increasing need for greater flexibility in grid operation. Utilities are relying more on generation from renewable power, primarily wind and solar, with output that varies depending on whether the wind or sun is available at any given time. This continued shift will also come with an increasing number of electric vehicles that creates new power demand.
A recent heat wave in Texas illustrated the need for a more flexible grid. The resulting high demand for power caused electricity prices in wholesale markets to increase more than 100-fold. In a grid without demand flexibility, supply or transmission problems can trigger a spike in market prices.
New opportunities
Fortunately, a variety of technological advances, such as “learning” or “smart” thermostats and grid-interactive water heaters, are creating new opportunities to develop a more-flexible grid while also delivering customer benefits. Smart thermostats can not only provide more efficient operation of home heating and air conditioning systems that reduces customer energy costs, but also allow grid operators to provide relief at times of peak power demands without compromising customer comfort. We found that Wi-Fi connected thermostats such as Nest or ecobee are the most common technology addressed through integrated EE-DR programs.
Degrees of integration
The level of integration varies among programs. At one end of the spectrum are programs that promote and possibly enable both energy efficiency and demand response, but provide incentives and services to achieve only one of them. For example, a residential thermostat program may focus on efficient control of air conditioning and heating systems, but not use the connected capabilities of such devices for demand response.
At the other end of the spectrum are fully integrated programs that provide incentives and services to actively achieve both EE and DR with a single customer interface. Here are five such programs:
Barriers and promise
Why are there so few integrated programs? We identified barriers that include varying program objectives and primary beneficiaries and result in different, often siloed approaches, funding, and administration.
Overcoming these barriers will require organizational changes and supportive regulation. The result, though, is well worth it. Combining and integrating ER and DR programs can increase customer value while also providing a more flexible, responsive, and reliable grid for the future.

Listen Up, 2020 Candidates: Energy Affordability Is A Major Problem;"As 2020 candidates craft their campaign platforms, new data show that energy affordability is a major problem in the United States. In fact, about one-fourth of all Americans and more than two-thirds of low-income households live with a high energy burden.
Energy burdens—the share of income spent on energy bills—can have serious impacts. Households with high burdens (those spending more than 6% of annual household income on energy bills) are often linked with respiratory health problems, increased stress, utility disconnections, and the perpetuation of poverty.
ACEEE analyzed newly available data to provide a national snapshot of energy affordability. According to the US Census’s 2017 American Housing Survey data (using the same methodology as our 2018 energy burden report), we find the following groups experience high energy burdens nationally:
67% of low-income households (200% of federal poverty level)
36% of African American households
34% of elderly households (age 65+)
29% of renting households
27% of Latinx households
24% of all US households  
Other households fare better. By comparison, 22.5% of white households, 21% of non-renting households, 20% of non-elderly households, and 5% of non-low-income households experience high energy burdens. Low-income households experience high energy burdens almost three times higher than that of the average household and 13 times higher than that of households that are not low-income.
ACEEE’s new policy brief on energy affordability includes information about national, urban, and rural energy burdens. In 2016, ACEEE conducted a study on urban energy burdens. We found that low-income households in 48 of the largest US cities experienced energy burdens that were three times as high as households that were not low-income. The study also found that communities of color, renters, and multifamily households experienced higher burdens than the average household.
Findings from ACEEE’s 2016 urban energy burden study, aceee.org/research-report/u1602
In 2018, ACEEE published a second energy burden study, this one focused on rural areas. It told a similar story. Low-income, elderly, non-white, renter, manufactured housing, and multifamily households all experienced higher burdens than the average household across rural regions.
Findings from ACEEE’s 2018 rural energy burden study, aceee.org/research-report/u1806
Energy efficiency can offer a long-term solution to high energy burdens. It helps households reduce their energy usage with measures such as weatherization, efficient appliances, and behavior change. If political candidates are interested in addressing energy affordability, they can support policies that improve and expand federal, state, and utility-funded low-income energy efficiency and weatherization programs. 
All Americans have the right to affordable energy bills and comfortable homes. The 2020 election offers a great opportunity for candidates and policymakers to ramp up efforts to help make this a reality.
Stay tuned for an updated ACEEE Urban Energy Burden report, which will provide the latest data on energy burdens in cities across the country and research on how community-led organizations can lead on energy affordability and energy efficiency.

US Cities Adopt Stricter Building Energy Codes;"As US cities ramp up their clean energy efforts, stricter building energy codes are some of their biggest success stories. In fact, 30 cities have taken steps to reduce energy waste in buildings by improving these codes, according to the newly released 2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard.
These cities are updating their codes, advocating for their state to do more, or benefitting from state action. Since 2017, nine cities adopted more-stringent building energy codes: Las Vegas, Mesa, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Reno, San Antonio, St. Louis, and Tucson. Another five cities successfully advocated for their states to adopt more stringent standards: Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Seattle. In addition, eight cities adopted efficiency requirements for existing buildings: Chicago, Denver, Minneapolis, New York, Reno, Salt Lake City, San José, and Washington, DC. 
Why does this matter? To address climate change, cities need to reduce buildings’ energy use, because residential and commercial buildings account for about 36% of total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions each year. Energy codes for new and existing buildings are a great way to do so. These codes affect up to 80% of a building’s energy load and, since buildings typically operate for decades before major renovation, the impact can really add up.
Building codes set minimum efficiency requirements for new buildings and those that undergo significant renovations. For example, they set minimum thresholds for roof and wall insulation, which help reduce heat loss through the building and increase occupant comfort. They also have criteria for the efficiency of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), as well as for lighting and water heating.
Findings from the 2019 City Scorecard
The map below summarizes city codes according to the New Building Institute’s zEPI scale, which is how we scored cities.
Boston and Worcester had the most stringent residential building energy codes, because they adopted the Massachusetts Stretch Energy Code. Meanwhile, St. Louis had the lowest commercial zEPI score. Cities with the lowest zEPI scores had all adopted the 2018 international energy conservation code.  
Which other cities prioritized building energy code adoption?
New York. Through Local Law 32 of 2018, the city compels itself to pass a stretch code in 2019 that is at least 20% more stringent than the state code.
Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania Legislature passed House Bill 409 in 2017, bringing its statewide building code up to the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) 2015 standard and enabling Philadelphia a one-time opportunity to update to 2018 codes for commercial construction. (Pennsylvania requires local jurisdictions to comply with state-mandated building energy codes.) The city took advantage of the opportunity by adopting the codes in June 2018.
Phoenix. The city adopted the 2018 IECC for residential construction in June 2018, one of the first in the nation to do so.
Some cities can’t take action on their own, though, as some states require cities to follow whatever code is set at the state level. In some cases, states updated their codes, bringing up the stringency of codes in effect in their cities. Six states—Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia—adopted updated codes, resulting in improved codes in 15 Scorecard cities. In other cases, states have taken no action, prompting cities to advocate for more stringent codes.
Building energy codes are a proven method for improving efficiency and cutting greenhouse gas emissions in cities. While both cities and states have an important role to play in the adoption and stringency of these codes, cities are increasingly recognizing the urgency around updating their codes and raising the bar where they can. With the advent of more ambitious climate goals, we anticipate more cities and states working together to slash energy consumption in buildings, implementing more stringent building codes as a first step.

In Case You Missed It: Six 2020 Candidates Discuss Energy Efficiency;"The 2020 presidential candidates aren’t pulling punches when it comes to energy waste and climate change. At CNN’s Climate Crisis Town Hall this past Wednesday, 10 Democratic candidates spoke out—and between the US Department of Energy rollback of energy efficiency standards for light bulbs, the pending challenges to vehicle fuel economy, and strategies to combat climate change, they had a lot to talk about.
But where do they stand on energy efficiency? If you didn’t have the stamina to watch the seven-hour marathon, we’ve got you covered. Here’s what six of the leading 2020 Democratic candidates had to say about efficiency’s role in a greener future, and in their potential administration.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said light bulb standards are a distraction from bigger issues.
[Light bulb standards] is exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we're all talking about. They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs, around your straws, and around your cheeseburgers. When 70% of the pollution of the carbon that we're throwing into the air comes from three industries [building, electric power, oil], and we can set our targets and say, by 2028, 2030, and 2035, no more. Think about that. Right there. Now, the other 30%, we still got to work on. Oh, no, we don't stop at 70%. But the point is, that's where we need to focus.
Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur, spoke up against the DOE’s rollback.
We need lightbulbs that don't burn out. Because you know these lightbulbs are manufactured so that they intentionally burn out, so there's an industry and we replace them over and over again. Do you think that's good for the earth? Of course not. If anything, we should be pushing regulations that make it so that our lightbulbs consume less energy and need to be replaced less often.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Mich., cited energy efficiency’s bipartisan support and versatility across multiple sectors. She advocated for “strict building standards,” electric cars and trucks, and green infrastructure.
These are just numerous examples of what we can be doing [with] energy efficiency, which I agree is low-hanging fruit. You know why it's popular with the public? Whether it's increasing the gas mileage standards and then eventually moving to electric cars, or the building standards, or the appliance standards — it's popular because if people save money they really like it. … And then of course the ultimate way to push these energy efficiency ideas is by pricing carbon.
Former Vice President Joe Biden also supported electric vehicles.
We have to take combustion engine vehicles off the road as rapidly as we can, but that also can create a significant number of jobs and opportunities for people …-- I propose we have 500,000 charging stations in the new green economy. We should own, we should own the electric vehicle market. I think we should raise the CAFE [vehicle fuel economy] standards, bring them back to where they were which would have saved 12 billion gallons of oil to begin with and move beyond … But the bottom line is, [we should] set in place standards that cannot be walked away from when, in fact, the next president, if someone else comes along, does what Trump tries to do.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., said climate solutions need to be broad and include light bulb efficiency.
It’s not just moving to sustainable energies. It is also being much more efficient in terms of the energy that we use. So if you can get electricity from a light bulb that utilizes one-tenth of the power that an old incandescent lightbulb used, of course you're going to do that. Of course you're going to encourage that technology. In Vermont, we are making it as easy as possible, helping people buy those lightbulbs. And it is, in my community, in Burlington, Vermont, if I'm not mistaken, over the last many years, despite good economic growth, we are not using any more electricity than we did 10 years ago because we have put investments into energy efficiency,” he said.  “And so that's the direction we've got to go.
Former US Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, said he would bring back environmental regulations, including the light bulb standards.
[We need] higher vehicle emissions standards, a clean power plan, and [to] completely electrify this economy from our power sector to our transportation sector to our industrial sector.
Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said his city has pledged to live up to the commitments made in the Paris Climate Agreement.
We have undertaken energy savings contracts to make our buildings more energy efficient, set up electric vehicle charging points so that we're modelling what needs to happen with the future of transportation. And we're doing it because we're living in a country where our national government has failed … We’re going to need more … old-fashioned building trade jobs to … do the retrofits to get the energy efficiency that we need.

DOE’s Light Bulb Standards Rollback Will Cost Americans $14 Billion Each Year;"Washington, DC—Today, the US Department of Energy (DOE) released two rules that continue the administration’s assault on common sense light bulb energy efficiency standards. The standards, scheduled to take effect in January 2020, would require most everyday light bulbs to achieve LED levels of energy efficiency, would save consumers billions of dollars, and would avoid millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
DOE issued a final rule that eliminates efficiency standards for about half of the six billion light bulbs used in US homes and businesses. The rule rolls back a 2017 light bulb definition that would expand the standards to cover the full range of bulb shapes and sizes used in our homes, including candle- and globe-shaped bulbs, candelabra-based bulbs, and reflector bulbs used in ceiling fixtures or track lighting.
DOE also issued a proposed determination designed to eliminate the 2020 standards for “A-lamps,” the pear-shaped bulbs that make up the other half of light bulbs. According to DOE, this notice — if finalized— would prevent automatic standards enacted by Congress in 2007 from taking effect. 
Based on ASAP and ACEEE analysis published last year, eliminating the 2020 standards for all light bulbs would cost US consumers up to $14 billion annually, which works out to more than $100 in lost bill savings every year per household. The rollback would increase annual climate-change emissions by about 38 million metric tons per year, or approximately the amount emitted by 8 million cars.
In response to these actions, Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), made the following statement:
“It makes zero sense to eliminate energy-saving light bulb standards that will save households money on electricity bills and cut climate change emissions by reducing the amount of coal and gas burned in power plants. LED light bulbs are a proven, popular product – it’s time for the national minimum standards to catch up to today’s technology.  Instead, the Trump administration is siding with manufacturers that want to keep selling outdated, energy-wasting light bulbs.”
Jennifer Amann, buildings program director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), added:
“In 2007, Congress took initial bipartisan steps to transition to energy-efficient lighting by 2020 with the support of lighting manufacturers, consumer and environmental advocates, and the Bush administration. Advances in LED bulbs—including vast decreases in retail prices—have outpaced the expectations set in 2007. Now is the time to complete this long-anticipated transition by moving forward with minimum standards that lock in energy bill savings and pollution reductions to benefit all Americans.”
A range of attorneys general as well as the Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthjustice, and many other organizations spoke out against DOE’s plan to roll back the scope of standards and will undoubtedly consider legal challenges to today’s actions. In addition, several states (California, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont and Washington) have enacted state light bulb standards in anticipation of the federal rollback.
  ACEEE acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.

State Energy Savings Targets Evolve to Meet New Policy Goals;"As more states seek to reduce costs and meet climate goals, new ACEEE research finds that energy efficiency resource standards (EERS) are delivering huge gains — 80% of all electricity savings — in the utility sector.
Our report, released today, shows that these energy savings targets —adopted by 27 US states over the past two decades — are the most effective utility-sector energy efficiency policy. In fact, in 2017, states with such targets achieved electricity savings at a rate four times higher than states without targets.

To build on this success, leading states are taking new approaches toward their EERS as they pursue multiple goals: lower costs, climate mitigation, increased utility flexibility to meet demand, and customer benefits (especially for those most in need) such as bill savings and healthier homes.
States with electricity savings targets in place. Shading indicates the average incremental annual level of electricity savings required by the policy. RES stands for Renewable Energy Standard
Some states are finding that their EERS policy needs to change. For many years, these energy savings targets have looked quite similar, calling for specific amounts of electricity (and sometimes natural gas) savings. The new generation of EERS policies casts a wider net, encouraging utilities and other program administrators to achieve multiple goals, like emissions reductions, electricity savings, and peak reductions, all while maximizing benefits to customers.
Our paper details five states that are evolving their EERS policies: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York. We find that, unlike earlier EERS policies, these new designs vary greatly. For example, while Massachusetts and New York have both adopted fuel-neutral savings goals, their overall frameworks look quite different.
Illustration of next-generation EERS policies in New York and Massachusetts.
States will need a comprehensive approach to decarbonization to ensure that everyone benefits. States are leaning on additional tools to meet their emissions-reduction goals while ensuring that costs stay low and benefits are delivered equitably. For example, some states create carve-outs or spending rules within their existing goals that guide utility investment toward underserved market segments, like the 18 states with spending requirements for low-income customers.
Others have established separate portfolios of programs to achieve their ambitious goals, keeping EERS targets largely unchanged. For example, California has used this separate-portfolio approach to address priorities like ensuring that electrification programs reach disadvantaged communities and scaling up building decarbonization. These strategies operate within a larger context, where cost-effectiveness rules, performance incentives, and potential study methodologies can have a major impact.
You can dive deeper into these findings in our new report, Next Generation Energy Efficiency Resource Standards. The report authors will discuss their findings in a webinar on Thursday, August 1 at 1 pm ET, joined by Commissioner Jennie Potter of the Hawaii Public Service Commission and Janet Joseph, Senior Vice President for Strategy and Market Development at New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).

These Colleges Get An A+ in Sustainability;"Nearly two-thirds of prospective students say a college's commitment to the environment influences their decision to apply to or attend the school. But which colleges are the most committed?
Colby College, Dickinson College, Sterling College, Middlebury College, and the College of the Atlantic are the top five baccalaureate colleges for sustainability, according to new annual rankings released today by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE).
Among universities that also award doctoral degrees, the top sustainability leaders are Stanford, the University of California Irvine, the University of New Hampshire, Colorado State University, and the University of Connecticut.
The AASHE rankings recognize leaders in 17 areas, ranging from buildings to curriculum. Topping the energy category are Thompson Rivers University, Stanford University, American University, University of New Hampshire, and the University of South Florida.
Colleges and universities that want to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability are encouraged to participate in Energy Efficiency Day and issue a proclimation recognizing the value of reducing energy waste.
We looked at four schools that scored highly on several national reports, including AASHE’s new report and the Princeton Review’s 2018 Top 50 Green Colleges list that is based on academic offerings, campus policies, initiatives, activities, and career preparation. 
Here’s what representatives from some of the top schools have to say about university sustainability, energy use, and student efforts to make their communities greener.
St. Mary’s College of Maryland | St Mary’s City, MD | 1,572 students:
“We have a mantra called the St. Mary’s Way: ‘where people respect the natural environment and the tradition of tolerance, which is the heritage of this place,’” says Thomas Brewer, environmental health and safety coordinator at St. Mary’s.
St. Mary’s was ranked the fifth greenest college by The Princeton Review. It boasts several intense sustainability initiatives, such as a pledge to go carbon neutral by 2020 and a waste-free campus program. The college has been replacing traditional lighting with LEDs, and many housing units couple these lights with motion sensors that reduce lighting to 10% when not in use.  
What’s next? Efficiency. “We would like to improve two of the largest consumers of energy on campus: fume hoods and swimming pools,” says Brewer. St. Mary’s plans to improve fume hood exhaust efficiency through independent flow metering valves, and to install pool covers to decrease the evaporation rate and maintain water temperature.
    Dickinson College | Carlisle, PA | 2,399 students:
“[Campus sustainability] is a long and collaborative process built on teamwork and relationships,” says Lindsey Lyons, assistant director, Center for Sustainability Education at Dickinson College. Starting in 2019, all students at Dickinson will need to take a sustainability course as part of its general degree requirements.  
Dickinson ranked fourth on Princeton Review’s list, and was a top performer in AASHE’s campus engagement, curriculum, and research categories. It was also recognized by AASHE as the second overall top performer for baccalaureate institutions.
Dickinson recently launched its Energy Dashboard, which monitors the energy use of more than 20 campus buildings in real time with the goal of educating Dickinsonians about energy conservation. The data are available at two on-campus locations and online. Through the dashboard, Dickinson residence halls compete against one another for the greatest reduction in energy consumption. Alerts can be set to help Dickinson meet its energy targets, and the software also allows the college’s sustainability office to access daily, weekly, or yearly trends in electricity use.
Lyons is also excited to announce that Dickinson will meet its target of driving net emissions down to zero this year. “[Sustainability is a] win-win-win” says Lyons —“savings for the college, learning for the students, and reduction in carbon emissions for the planet.”
University of Vermont | Burlington, VT | 11,328 students
“Student leadership has been a key factor,” says Gioia Thompson, sustainability director for UVM. She cites student action as an instigator for several initiatives, including the purchase of 100% renewable electricity (since 2015), the ending of bottled water sales, and getting sustainability certified custodial products. UVM’s Student Government Association calculates the carbon emissions associated with campus buildings and university club travel, and it purchases carbon offsets out of its own budget. 
UVM ranked third on the Princeton review’s list, and was an AASHE top performer in the energy category.
UVM’s energy efficiency efforts began in the 1990s. “The big story has been the upgrades to central utility infrastructure and investment in central chilled water system, resulting in improved efficiency overall, as well as improved comfort,” says Thompson. “Through significant investment in energy efficiency improvements and LEED-certified buildings, UVM used 6% less total energy (MMBTUs) in 2014 than in 2007. Meanwhile, building space increased 7% and population increased 10%. Total GHG emissions dropped 41% between 2007-2017 as a result of energy efficiency and renewable electricity. “
In July 2019, UVM announced that its new supercomputer involves state-of-the-art processors that are extremely energy efficient, using 20 times less electricity than normal server processors.
What advice does UVM have for other colleges trying to meet energy goals? Update them. Thompson explains that most environmental goals were set a decade ago, under the assumption that there would be ongoing federal support for environment- and climate change-related initiatives. “Ten years later, the global, national, regional and local context has changed, and some of these goals need revisiting,’ she says.
Currently, UVM is working on low-carbon transportation projects and improving both campus and community resilience in the face of increasingly severe weather events. 
College of the Atlantic | Bar Harbor, ME | 332 students:
The College of the Atlantic ranked first on Princeton Review’s list and was recognized as a top performer in AASHE’s curriculum, energy, and grounds categories. It was the fifth overall top performer among baccalaureate institutions, and received recognition for its Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) data accuracy.
COA was the first college to go carbon neutral in 2007, and has committed to becoming fossil-fuel free by 2030. In its steps towards achieving this goal, COA has undergone a full energy audit of its campus and is currently renovating its buildings to increase efficiency and comfort. This has involved switching from fossil fuel-based heating sources to electric heat pumps and carbon-neutral fuels, and encouraging sustainable transportation by installing electric vehicle charging points. COA recently broke ground on a new, super energy-efficient Center for Human Ecology.
We spoke with Laura Berry and Spencer Gray of COA’s Community Energy Center. “Energy efficiency has been one of our biggest factors in working towards a sustainable, fossil fuel-free campus,” says Berry.  “We live in a cold, northern climate, and [sustainable heating] will always be our biggest challenge. Much of our work aims at decreasing our heating load through air sealing, insulation, and tightening our building envelopes in order to improve our building efficiency and [increase] comfort for students, faculty, and staff.”
We asked what advice COA had for other universities reaching towards a greener campus. Her answer? Energy efficiency, fearlessness, and student involvement. “’Carbon neutrality’ doesn’t have to mean building multi-million dollar, LEED-certified academic buildings or massive solar arrays on campus,” Berry says. “The biggest impact on carbon emissions can come from the least flashy changes, like building renovations, insulation, and weather stripping, that actually decrease energy use, rather than simply offset it.”
“Colleges and universities are the places to experiment and lead through innovative policies and programs. Don’t be afraid to try something new,” Berry says. She adds that student involvement is key to a sustainable campus: “Integrate students into sustainability planning and campus operations -- beyond just internships or volunteering at an Earth Day festival. Empower students to help lead the way towards decreasing campus carbon emissions, and they’ll probably surprise you with their creativity and dedication to addressing climate change.”

  But what’s a college student to do?
Large-scale efforts are game-changers for campus sustainability, but what can individual students do on their own? Thomas Brewer of St. Mary’s College, Gioia Thompson of UVM, and Laura Berry of COA share how incoming students can make their campus greener:  
St. Mary’s College: “Behavior modification is one of the best ways for students to increase energy efficiency and sustainability on campus,” Brewer says. This includes taking shorter showers, turning off lights, using less single-use plastics, recycling, and composting.
University of Vermont: “Walk, bike, scooter, or skate—use your own power,” says Thompson. She also advises that students share large appliances, like mini-fridges, and work to reduce the waste they create. Students should also ask their professors about incorporating climate change topics into the curriculum, when appropriate.
College of the Atlantic: “Get involved and take the lead!” says Berry.  “Go to your sustainability department and ask how you can help with on-campus programs, and find out what support there is for students to do sustainability projects. Get together with other like-minded students to start a dorm composting system, grow a community garden plot, or organize a student competition to decrease energy use in the dorms. And, of course, work through student groups and committees to push your college or university to go even further on their climate commitments.”

Making Every Energy Unit Count for the Customer;"Provocative talks at last week’s Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry spotlighted ways to slash energy consumption by better matching customer  needs with energy supply. 
This is a huge issue given the urgency of climate change, calls for decarbonization, and the trillions of dollars needed to transform industry, which accounts for  25% of energy-related greenhouse gases. Most generated energy does not reach the customer because of inefficiencies in production, transmission, design, mechanical systems, and mismatch with needs. Society cannot afford such waste. We need to squeeze far more value out of every unit of energy. 
Our recent Summer Study Industry, which drew near record attendance and attracted a younger audience than in prior years, explored various ways to boost energy productivity such as strategic energy management and smart manufacturing.
In his keynote address, physicist Amory Lovins discussed the need to focus on why and how energy is used by customers. Lovins, cofounder and chief scientist of the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), cited the value of prioritizing purpose and application over equipment, simple rather than complex, and current needs before historical approaches.  He emphasized these principles of Integrative Design using illustrations from case studies across the automotive, industry, buildings, and electronics sectors. 
By focusing first on customers and then generating the energy how, when, and where they need it, Lovins said power plants can achieve immense savings.  For example, RMI found that new industrial facilities could reduce their energy use 40-90%, often with lower capital costs. The plant value of RMI’s industrial redesign projects, both new facilities and retrofits of existing ones, totaled more than $40 billion, and there is a lot more value across society to attain with this methodology.
The focus on customer energy needs can also uncover erroneous status quo assumptions, noted Jonathan Jutsen, chief executive officer of the Australian Alliance for Energy Productivity. In food delivery for example, recent pilots revealed shortened shelf life in 90% of shipments due to improper temperature control. Improved monitoring is debunking assumptions of food cooling, sparking new approaches such as local processing and use of cold boxes (vs. refrigerated trucks).  This is key, because a 1% reduction in food waste could save $240 million each year and avoid 240,000 annual tonnes of GHGs in Australia.
This customer-first approach is also upending the use of centralized steam for process heat in industrial sectors, showing that electric heating (via on-site renewable energy) can provide steadier temperature control, less energy use, lower capital costs, and a smaller footprint.  An array of electric technologies can now provide hot water or air on-demand, when, where, and how customers need it.  For example, thousands of heat pumps are in service globally supplying water up to 95 oC and air to 120 oC.  The technology is being extended to provide heat to 150 oC. 
We learned why this tenacious drive for efficiency matters in Christine Ervine’s keynote talk connecting climate change with energy use.  Ervin, the first president/CEO of the US Green Building Council and a former US Assistant Secretary of Energy, noted that one-third of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was made in the United States, echoing calls to reinvent the way we produce and use energy.
Citing the International Energy Administration, Ervin said that while energy efficiency has offset 12% of global energy growth since 2000, efficiency codes or standards still do not apply to more than 70% of all energy used. So, we need a laser focus on policies and low-carbon technologies that encourage efficiency and reduce energy waste. 
These talks underscored the need to optimize our energy use and make step-change reductions in energy and GHG emissions.

At Risk: Heavy-Duty Vehicle Fuel Economy;"The Trump administration’s efforts to roll back the light-duty vehicle fuel economy standards have received a lot of attention. Much less known is its stalling of heavy-duty vehicle fuel economy standards, which would also boost fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions — significantly increasing health risks for all.
Heavy-duty vehicles, such as tractor trucks, vocational vehicles, work trucks, and trailers, consume 31% of energy used by all on-road vehicles despite being just 5% of the vehicles on the road. They emit about one-fourth of the total carbon emissions from the transportation sector. In addition, heavy-duty vehicles’ share of fuel consumption globally is increasing, which makes them a critical market segment to target for improved energy efficiency.
Despite this carbon footprint, the Trump administration is stalling Phase 2 of the fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. Originally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) were slated to update the standards in two phases to facilitate the transition to more fuel-efficient vehicles. This second phase, adopted in 2016, was designed to cover a wider variety of heavy-duty vehicles as well as trailers and to extend standards beyond 2018 to 2027.
Glider trucks, in particular, are concerning. These are trucks with new bodies but old engines and transmissions. Gliders typically emit 20-40 times more emissions than today’s new diesel engines, according to testing by the EPA’s laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Phase 2 rule placed an annual cap of 300 “glider” trucks per manufacturer that will be exempted from meeting the criteria pollutant and greenhouse gas standards. The Trump administration’s EPA tried to repeal the glider provisions, citing research funded by the glider industry. This woefully deficient research claimed that glider trucks did not produce any more emissions than those with modern diesel engines.
The EPA was not successful in its repeal after severe backlash from almost all stakeholders except the glider industry. Instead, the agency decided not to enforce the 300-unit cap through 2019, risking the health of American public. The Washington DC Court of Appeals ordered EPA to continue to enforce glider truck requirements. Yet the new EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler, committed in his confirmation hearing to reconsider the Phase 2 glider provisions despite the opposition of the trucking industry and other stakeholders. It is hard to imagine how the administration could justify repealing the glider provisions when EPA’s Ann Arbor test results were recently found to comply with EPA standard practices by the agency’s Office of Inspector General.  
Trailers for tractor trucks are another example of the EPA holding up progress. Trailers under the Phase 2 rule would have delivered an estimated 7% improvement in tractor-trailer fuel efficiency starting in model year 2018. The trailer requirements were stayed by the DC Court of Appeals in response to a legal challenge by the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association along with EPA inaction. Despite the court’s direction that the parties file a status report every 90 days, the EPA has not provided a status update since August 2018. As a result, the nation will be consuming an extra 40,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025.
While the Trump administration is compromising federal heavy-duty fuel efficiency standards, there is progress at the state level. California will enforce standards for 2020 model year trailers, requiring manufacturers to certify trailers they want to sell in the state.
In addition, California is forging ahead on medium- and heavy-duty vehicle electrification. California has programs that incentivize the purchase of zero-emission buses and trucks. The state is now working on a program that could require half of vocational vehicles and 15% of tractor trucks sold in California to be electric by 2030.
But state programs are not enough. The federal government must act to reap the multiple benefits of efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles. The trucking industry and American consumers cannot afford to squander 40,000 barrels of oil per day, and the public cannot afford the health costs of that much more pollution. The EPA should enforce the glider cap in the Phase 2 rule and preserve its trailer provisions, if not enhance them. Without addressing carbon emissions from the transportation sector, there will be no realistic way for the United States to reach its climate goals.

Florida Cities Call for Stronger Utility Energy Savings Targets;"Florida cities and counties are going to bat for their residents and pushing for utilities to set stronger energy savings goals. Utility efficiency programs are a critical tool supporting local government efforts to improve sustainability, reduce emissions, and promote job growth. But as cities and counties are working to ramp up energy savings, utilities are going backwards.
The Florida Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (FEECA) directs the state’s Public Service Commission (PSC) to adopt goals for utilities to increase energy efficiency and conservation efforts. In 2014, we reported that energy savings goals for Florida utilities shrank significantly to about 10% of prior targets. The Commission revisits energy savings targets every five years, and this time around, it’s even worse than before. In fact, four of the seven Florida utilities subject to FEECA have proposed goals of zero for the years 2020-2029.
Local governments are taking notice. In a series of resolutions and letters to the PSC, Florida cities and counties are calling for far more ambitious energy efficiency targets that align with local targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions. The City of Coral Gables passed a resolution in early July that urges the Commission “to set meaningful, impactful, cost-effective, and conservation conscious goals.” Coral Gables noted that strong utility-run efficiency programs are an essential component of meeting the city’s 100% clean, renewable energy goal but that current savings from these programs fall well below the national average. Miami-Dade County also linked utility energy savings goals to county-wide emission reduction efforts in a resolution adopted in May.
The city of Miami Beach echoed calls for meaningful energy savings goals in their resolution, pushing for regulators to bring Florida’s energy savings in line with the national average. The city further urged regulators to fix the underlying practices that led utilities to propose such minimal goals – namely, the reliance on the Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM) test, which counts the revenues utilities could lose due to increased energy savings as a cost. Florida is the only state to rely primarily on RIM to assess its cost effectiveness programs. Other states have moved away from primary reliance on RIM, recognizing that it does not appropriately value energy efficiency as a resource.
These calls for improved regulatory frameworks and stronger savings goals were echoed by cities across the state. The cities of Dunedin, Largo, St. Petersburg, and Sarasota all submitted letters to the PSC asking regulators to use the FEECA process to set savings goals for utilities that would help, not hinder, local efforts to shift toward a cleaner and more resilient energy grid.
What’s next?
Next week, the Commission will convene stakeholders for hearings on utility energy savings goals. Already, FEECA dockets have been flooded with public comments (including comments from ACEEE). At the hearings, the Commission will weigh the perspectives of various stakeholders, many of which will echo the points that cities have surfaced in their letters and resolutions. With cities and counties taking the lead in the shift toward clean and efficient energy in Florida, it remains an open question whether state regulators will give local governments and Floridians the support they need.

Good News From the Midwest: Michigan Emerges as Energy Efficiency Powerhouse;"Despite recent challenges and setbacks for energy efficiency in the Midwest, promising advances are also taking place. Perhaps most notable is the story unfolding in Michigan, where smart policy decisions over the past decade have already led to utility efficiency programs that will reduce utility costs statewide by more than $9 billion, with even greater efforts committed earlier this spring. Then in June, one of the state’s two major utilities filed a resource plan that would double its rate of program savings over the next two decades.
Here’s a bit of the backstory:
The “modern era” of utility energy efficiency in Michigan began in 2008, after a decade of literally no utility EE programs. The enactment of legislation (PA 295) created an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), increasing up to 1% savings per year by 2012. After eight years of successfully meeting those savings targets, new legislation (PA 342) passed in December 2016 made several critical improvements to Michigan’s policy framework, including the following:
Creating an enhanced performance incentive for utilities to hit 1.25% and 1.5% annual savings.
Eliminating the existing utility EE spending cap (which had been 2% of revenues).
Creating a new requirement for utilities to do integrated resource plans (IRPs) and laying out important guidelines and requirements for how the IRPs should be conducted.
In response to the 2016 legislation, both of the major utilities in Michigan (Consumers Energy and DTE) filed new energy efficiency plans intending to meet the 1.5% savings target. Their prompt response helps demonstrate yet again that and that addressing the utility is critically important.
Even more impressive is the integrated resource plan that Consumers Energy filed in June. It calls for ramping up EE program savings to 2.0% per year by 2021 and sustaining that through 2029, and then increasing further by 2030 to 2.25% per year for the next decade. This major energy efficiency commitment is a key factor (along with an expansion of demand response and 5,000 MW of solar) in the Consumers Energy plan, which calls for no additions of fossil-fueled generation over the 20-year planning period, earlier retirement of certain coal plants, and an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions (from 2005 levels) by 2040.
In reflecting on these developments, I suggest three big lessons from this Michigan story:
Policies matter. Enacting strong policies (including an EERS, a practical cost-recovery mechanism, and a substantial utility performance incentive) enabled Michigan to move in one decade from a state with zero utility energy efficiency programs to one of the top states in the nation.
Very positive energy efficiency policies can be achieved in a “red” state. When Michigan enacted its 2016 legislation, Republicans then (as now) controlled both chambers of the legislature and the governorship. These energy efficiency policies, sometimes decried as “liberal,” have proven very effective and popular in Michigan. Other Republican-led states should support these business- and customer-friendly policies. (Historically, state support for energy efficiency was very bipartisan. It would be nice to return to those days.)
Utility leadership matters. Finally, one very important element in the Consumers Energy story has been the emergence of a strong leadership team that seems truly interested in moving toward clean energy resources. Keep an eye on Consumers Energy’s CEO Patti Poppe, who has been instrumental in the company’s emerging commitment to sustainability.
As someone who has worked on utility energy efficiency issues in Michigan for more than three decades, I find it very gratifying to see my home state become such a positive example. Congratulations! Keep up the momentum! [By happy coincidence, the July issue of Public Utilities Fortnightly had a full feature cover story on the Michigan Public Service Commission.]
I hope that Michigan’s success can be a positive inspiration to other Midwest states. Illinois is building on strong 2016 legislation, and Minnesota has a process that could lead to its own advancements. Looking ahead, there could be some interesting competition for leadership in the Midwest. While Ohio and Indiana have had setbacks in recent years, I hope they can see Michigan’s commitments, in a politically similar situation, as a helpful example. New England and the West Coast have tended to lead on energy efficiency for quite a while. Now it’s time to earn more recognition for successful energy efficiency policies out here in “flyover country.”

Breaking Barriers: Women in Energy Efficiency Tell Their Stories;"Currently, Rick Perry is secretary of the US Department of Energy. Here are his predecessors. Credit: US Department of Energy.
  Of the 14 people who have led the US Department of Energy since its founding in 1977, only one is a woman: Hazel O’Leary, who served in the early 1990s. At the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, one-third of confirmed administrators have been women.
These numbers are hardly surprising. The energy and environmental fields, especially the former, have traditionally been dominated by men. In fact, women account for only one-fourth of energy efficiency workers, according to the 2019 U.S. Energy and Employment report.
REGISTER FOR SSI
To explore the experiences of women in this field, ACEEE is hosting its first Women in Energy Efficiency event at our Summer Study Industry next month in Portland, Oregon, with support from the Karen and Neal Elliott Fund. Two speakers will share their stories: Susan Stratton, executive director of the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, and Christine Ervin, former president/CEO of the U.S. Green Building Council and former US Assistant Secretary of Energy.
We asked three other women to tell their stories as well, including the leader of an environmental organization and two Summer Study panel co-chairs. They spoke candidly, sharing both their inspiration and advice.
When Kathleen Rogers became president of the year-round Earth Day Network nearly two decades ago, she says the CEOs of all the major environmental groups were men. (Most of these groups are still led by men.) “It’s not as if they’re not awesome, committed men, it’s just that … sometimes, conversations [with them] can feel foreign,” she says. “Once you reorient them, I’ve found that they’re very responsive.”
“We just have to have the courage to speak up,” Rogers adds. “We do! Because I don’t find [men] resistant, I don’t find them rolling their eyes the way they used to—and trust me, they used to. But I think the barriers remain in the sense that you’ve got to be willing to stick your neck out even if you feel stupid—and I often do, because I’m bringing up a different way of looking at things. [Men and women] can go about things differently, so having that balance is really key.”
  Kristin Bennett and Emily Thorn Corthay, who will co-host a Summer Study panel called “Inspirational Future,” also discussed their experiences. Bennett is the owner, president, and chief executive officer of KB Science, a research consulting firm based in Boston and Washington, DC. Corthay, president of Thorn Associates, is one of five certified energy manager (CEM) instructors in Canada.
Below are excerpts of our conversation.
What has been your experience as a woman in a male-dominated field?
Kristin: As mechanical engineer by first degree and geologist by PhD with a specialty in geophysics, crystallography, and texture analysis, I was often the only woman in the room, either in classes, meetings, or conferences. In 1988, as an undergraduate in engineering, I was the only woman with 85 men in my mechanical engineering classes at King's College. As an undergrad, I recall a male student saying to me that women’s brains worked differently than men’s, and women did not think like engineers. I got used to being different, underrepresented, and, well, lonely. 
Most in my direct community who know my work treat me with equity, for which I am grateful. On the other hand, others, who may not be clear on my experience and contributions, have judged, discriminated, and tested me twice or three times more than male colleagues.
I run my own company now, in our 11th year, as a woman-owned small business. I love what I do. I love our work. I care about the impact and our contribution to energy efficiency and helping to provide a better, cleaner, emissions-free world. I am proud to be a woman doing it.
Emily: I’ve found that we are sometimes held to a higher standard and have to prove ourselves more than men. Some of my obstacles have included having to choose how to confront (or ignore) sexually explicit material being posted publicly in university and in the workplace, learning after being hired that one of the decision makers said that “girls should not be working in laboratories but rather stay at home,” and being repeatedly mistaken for a waitress or administrative personnel at conferences when I was the instructor or leader. 
Opportunities, however, have also arisen—for example, with the increased emphasis on women in leadership roles. I was elected director of the board of the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, where I think that the membership understands the value of electing a diverse and gender-balanced board of directors.  
What made you pursue a career in the energy field?
Emily: After reading a newspaper [article] on fuel cell technology, I immediately fell in love with the technology and spent the next five years in that industry. I then wanted to broaden my horizon to energy efficiency more generally and have grown to be very passionate about saving our planet (and my industrial clients’ money) through energy efficiency and carbon emissions reductions. 
Kristin: I was attracted through crystallography to making or modeling new materials for energy-efficiency platforms. I also liked that working in the energy field, I had the opportunity to travel (e.g., New Zealand, Japan, Russia, India) to understand global energy efficiency concerns, tools, and solutions.
How have things changed—or not—since you began your career?
Emily: Since I began my career over 15 years ago, there has been more emphasis on increasing women in engineering as well as women in leadership roles. In addition, a broader emphasis on equity, diversity, and inclusion is now the norm. 
Kristin: After 30 years, the number of women in the mechanical engineering workforce remains about 7-9% ... As I have gotten older, I have become more accustomed to the lack of diversity in energy efficiency and feel more at ease in my career. I have found a few female mentors, though one turned out to be competitive instead of supportive. I have many examples still of being the only woman in the room. Today I chair the Strategic Advisory Committee, Energy & Environment S&T for Idaho National Lab, as the only woman on the committee. I have found certain management at the DOE labs less tolerant of sexual/gender harassment, which is promising.
What advice would you give a young woman interested in industrial energy efficiency? 
Emily: Industrial energy efficiency is a fast-growing field (in Canada, it’s growing at 8.3% per year, about triple the economy as a whole), so if you are a young woman, a career in this field will open up many exciting opportunities. I also think the process aspect of the industrial field—as opposed to commercial or residential—is complex and fascinating, so you will never be bored and can also improve your economic success as more complex custom industrial processes can command higher salaries/consulting rates. Most importantly, you are helping save humanity from the worst effects of climate change by reducing carbon emissions.
Kristin: Following my postdoc, I had a pivotal conversation with a woman leader and CEO for a successful biomedical research company. She gave me some enlightened advice: “Kristin, every woman in leadership feels lonely. You are not alone. If you want to make a difference in the world, and ‘make the world a better place,’ as you say, go back to what you know. Do what you love to do. Go back to the lab. There will you make a difference in the world, simply by being you. Make a difference by doing what you love.”
I would (and do) warn them, it is not easy in a male-dominated workplace, but it is worth it. Reach out to the Society of Women Engineers, ACEEE, C3E-like networks. Join as many women in science networks as you can. There are many. Document sexual harassment and do not be afraid to report it. Choose people to work with who respect your work, treat you equally, and celebrate your perspective. You will not be alone.

Senate Bill Would Extend Benefits of Utility Efficiency Programs Nationwide;"Washington, DC—Today, Senator Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) introduced the American Energy Efficiency Act of 2019 with cosponsors Senator King (I-Maine) and Senator Merkley (D-Oregon). The bill sets a national energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), administered by the states, to lower utility bills for consumers and reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. EERS programs work by setting energy consumption reduction targets for electricity and natural gas, with targets slowly ratcheting up over time. Utilities meet these targets by offering efficiency programs to help their customers save energy, reduce waste, and save money.
Steve Nadel, Executive Director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE):
“We commend Senators Tina Smith, Angus King, and Jeff Merkley for introducing the American Energy Efficiency Act of 2019, which would save consumers and businesses $150 billion dollars over 25 years of programs while saving energy and reducing emissions. Energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest way to address climate change, as indicated by the broad coalition of support from stakeholders, unions, and industry. The bill creates an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard to be administered by the states with staggering impact: saving 128 quadrillion Btu of energy (quads) over more than 25 years (which is more energy than the US uses in a year), reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 6 billion metric tons (more than the total US emissions in a year), and eventually resulting in 400,000 added jobs.”

US Cities Boost Clean Energy Efforts but Few on Track to Meet Climate Goals;"Scorecard of 75 large US cities reveals the top 10, including Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Washington, DC. 
Washington, DC — US cities are ramping up their clean energy efforts, notably with stricter energy-saving rules for buildings, but only a few cities appear on track to meet their community-wide climate goals, according to the 2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard, released today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 
For the first time, the ACEEE Scorecard tracks policy efforts to advance renewable energy in addition to energy efficiency, because both are needed to build a clean energy future and address climate change. It is the most comprehensive national report that tracks city progress toward climate goals. 
The Scorecard shows that cities took more than 265 initiatives to advance efficiency and renewable energy between January 2017 and April 2019, ranging from modest but practical efforts such as Philadelphia’s teleworking for public employees to cutting-edge policies such as Washington, DC’s new high-performance standards for existing buildings.  
Yet the Scorecard also reveals that most cities with climate goals are either not on track to achieve them or are not yet tracking progress. One-third (27) of the 75 cities surveyed have yet to even set greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. Of the 48 with targets, 21 are not yet fully tracking their progress. The remaining 27 have data, and of those, 8 are not projected to be close to achieving their targets and 8 are projected to make substantial progress but still fall short. Only 11 are on track to meet their GHG reductions goals. 
Cities vary widely in their policies and performance. The scorecard, which ranks cities on more than 50 metrics, has these key findings: 
Boston retains its first-place ranking, earning 77.5 out of a possible 100 points. It’s followed by San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, Washington, DC, New York City, Los Angeles, Denver, Austin, and Portland. This year, Minneapolis adopted policies requiring homes and apartment buildings to disclose their energy use to buyers or renters. New York City recently established programs calling for large buildings that benchmark energy use to post their energy performance ratings. 
 Cincinnati, Hartford, and Providence are Cities to Watch. They did not make the top 10 but stand out for adopting several major clean energy policies and programs since early 2017, improving their ranks since the last scorecard. Hartford created an energy improvement district, began converting its streetlights to LEDs, and has taken steps to improve location efficiency through improvements to the zoning code. 
Cities expanded efforts to save energy in new and existing buildings. Since 2017, nine cities—Las Vegas, Mesa, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Reno, San Antonio, St. Louis, and Tucson—adopted more-stringent building energy codes and five advocated for their states to do so. In addition, eight cities—Chicago, Denver, Minneapolis, New York, Reno, Salt Lake City, San José, and Washington, DC—adopted efficiency requirements for existing buildings. 
Cities increased their push to reduce GHGs from the transportation sector but not as much as they did with buildings. To slash emissions, they need to accelerate their action. Since 2017, nine cities developed targets to increase public transit, biking, and walking in lieu of driving. 
Some cities are engaging with and investing in low-income communities and communities of color. Still, they have significant room for improvement. They can tap planning models—like those used in Minneapolis, Providence, and Seattle—to jumpstart their activities. 
  ""Cities are making impressive clean energy gains—taking big steps to waste less energy and encourage more renewable power. But they have more to do,” said ACEEE senior research manager David Ribeiro, the lead report author. “Cities must continue their push for innovative buildings policies, take greater steps to tackle transportation emissions, and better track progress to know which investments have the greatest impact. With their innovation, ingenuity, and resolve, they can build prosperous and equitable low-carbon communities.” 
Boston’s Mayor Marty Walsh said: “Nearly three quarters of Boston greenhouse gas emissions comes from our buildings. We’re working hard to improve the performance of those buildings and looking at how new ones can be built smarter. If we’re to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, we have to accelerate our actions and lead by example. That’s why we’ve already surpassed our municipal climate goals and reduced emissions by 37 percent. I’m proud of Boston for leading the rankings once again and am inspired by other cities for their bold action.”     
Minneapolis’ Mayor Jacob Frey: “In the absence of leadership from the federal government, local governments have had to step up and take the lead on climate policy. Climate action is intrinsically linked to housing and equity, and we will continue to lead on efforts to make Minneapolis the greenest city in America.” 
Denver’s Mayor Michael Hancock: “The effects of climate change are very real, and they are happening right now. This is a time to lead, and our response must rise to the occasion of this challenge. Progress is being made at the local level, and Denver will continue to step up our efforts to reduce energy waste and pollution, as well as strengthen our resiliency as a community and make bold decisions to transform to a clean energy economy.” 
The 2019 report, our fourth ranking of cities, scores 75 large US cities, 24 more than our previous edition in 2017. It includes all 25 cities participating in Bloomberg Philanthropies’ American Cities Climate Challenge, eight of which land on ACEEE’s top 10 list. This expanded Scorecard adds city efforts to encourage renewable energy, the impact of their policies, and their investment in and engagement with low-income communities and communities of color. Because of these extensive changes, we caution against simple comparisons to past scores and ranks. 
The Scorecard, using information collected as of April 1, 2019, ranks cities in five policy areas: 
 Local government operations. Austin, Boston, and Orlando tie for first place in this area. They have policies to increase efficiency in city government, procurement, and asset management. 
Community-wide initiatives. Washington, DC takes top honors, followed by Seattle. They have GHG reduction goals, strategies to mitigate urban heat islands, and policies or programs to plan for distributed energy systems such as on-site renewables. 
Buildings policies. Boston ranks first, followed by New York, San José, Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. These cities have adopted or advocated for stringent building energy codes, devoted resources to building code compliance, and used incentives or requirements to address energy consumption in existing buildings.   
Energy and water utilities. San Diego stars in this category, followed by Los Angeles, Boston, Chula Vista, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Their energy utilities have efficiency programs delivering significant savings, and the cities and utilities are working together to increase their use of renewable energy.  
Transportation policies. San Francisco takes the top spot, followed by Washington, DC, Boston, Portland, and Seattle. These cities promote public transit, efficient vehicles and vehicle infrastructure, and freight system efficiency.  
“Year after year it is tremendous to see cities from every corner of the country ramp up their efforts to reduce climate pollution and improve lives for urban communities,” said Antha Williams, Environment Programs Lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies, a major funder of the ACEEE report. “The Scorecard documents the incredible growth of the field and Bloomberg is proud to support these efforts through initiatives like the American Cities Climate Challenge.” 
Lois DeBacker, managing director of The Kresge Foundation’s Environment Program, also a major Scorecard funder, said: ""It is vital that cities move quickly to reduce their carbon emissions and that they do so in ways that engage and benefit all residents, including low-income communities and communities of color. ACEEE's City Clean Energy Scorecard offers a clear guide for local leaders to learn from one another how to transition to clean energy in an equitable manner.""

Hot Enough for You? Utilities Need to Transform to Address Climate Goals;"As the United States swelters from yet another heat wave, much greater utility transformation — with energy efficiency at its core — will be needed to address the rise in extreme weather events and other factors linked to climate change. Yet state efforts to develop the utility of the future seem to be falling short.
Many US states and industry experts have been discussing and promoting the concept of the ‘utility of the future’—envisioned as a paradigm shift in the way electricity is produced and delivered. I recently presented research on this topic at the European Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy Summer Study in early June. While some states are adopting bold new clean energy and climate policies, the utility-of-the-future efforts have not generally been driven by climate objectives, and not at all by energy efficiency objectives.
An industry in flux
The electric utility industry in the United States is facing many challenges. These include: aging infrastructure needing major investment; economic pressure from slow demand growth; the need to integrate new technology; competitive pressures from alternative suppliers and customer-sited resources; and societal obligations from environmental, equity, and other policy objectives. As the industry faces major transformation, several leading states have begun to develop a utility of the future that addresses those challenges.  
Overlaying this context is a growing awareness of the urgency of addressing climate change.  The recent United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report tells us that we have barely a decade to make dramatic changes. This highlights the critical importance of what emerges from utility-of-the-future efforts in the United States. To achieve the necessary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, the United States needs the full-fledged participation, and indeed leadership, by our utility companies in promoting energy efficiency.
How much has climate policy driven power sector transformation?
To examine the intersection of these two pressing priorities (utility reform and the climate crisis), I reviewed regulatory orders, project reports, and other key documents for seven states that the trade press identified as leaders in examining the utility of the future. Those states include: Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Minnesota and Rhode Island. This review focused on two key areas: the extent to which their discussions were motivated by climate concerns; and the extent to which their efforts have emphasized energy efficiency. I also reviewed a dozen recent reports and articles on the subject of the utility of the future by key organizations and industry experts, to examine the prevailing thinking on this subject in the United States today.
To briefly summarize: states rarely mentioned concern about climate change as a major motivation for discussing the utility of the future. Rather, the motivating factors identified are much more traditional. By far the leading factors, mentioned prominently by all seven states, were: the aging infrastructure and the need for investment to maintain a reliable and affordable electricity grid; the need to integrate new technologies (e.g., advanced metering; smart communication technologies and distributed resources); and the drive to empower customers.
Many of the states and industry experts emphasize integrating renewable energy into the grid (although not necessarily with an explicit climate connection). Also, some states have other initiatives demonstrating their leadership on tackling climate change (our recent blog post offers examples of states adopting aggressive clean energy policies). But with few exceptions, climate change has generally not been articulated as a driver for the utility-of-the-future discussions.
Energy efficiency, a clean energy workhorse, is too often missing from the conversation
Most disappointing was the fact that these discussions had almost no focus on the role of utilities in expanding energy efficiency. In several of the states there was a casual acknowledgement that utilities would continue to comply with other existing policy requirements for energy efficiency, (and on at least one occasion an effort to scale up efficiency). Indeed, several of these states are leaders in our State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. However, given the large opportunity and need to find a way to scale up efficiency investments in the utility sector, it was surprising and concerning that none of the states identified expanding energy efficiency as a driver for the discussion of the need for a utility of the future.
During the past century, the fundamental goal of the US electric system has been to bring “reliable, affordable electricity” to everyone. While those traditional factors are worthy objectives in discussing the utility of the future, they essentially ignore what arguably should be a—perhaps ‘the’—primary objective of energy utilities going forward: being leaders in the effort to mitigate climate change. We need our utilities to play a central role in reducing GHG emissions, and energy efficiency needs to be a major component of that effort.
Transatlantic learning on energy efficiency in the power sector
This highlights what is a striking difference between the European and the US approaches to utility sector energy efficiency. In Europe, climate-related objectives (reducing GHG emissions) are the driving motivation for energy efficiency policy, with almost no focus on the value of energy efficiency as a utility system resource. In the United States, the framing is exactly the opposite, with exhaustive focus on energy efficiency as a cost-effective utility system resource, and GHG reduction only occasionally mentioned, typically as an ancillary benefit. Each side could benefit from a better appreciation of the other’s perspective.
Greater transformation needed
Unfortunately, what one sees so far in US utility-of-the-future discussions is primarily the application of new 21st century tools (e.g., smart grid, integration of distributed energy resources, expansion of customer choice, etc.) to pursue the same old 20th century objectives (e.g., reliability, lower costs, shave peaks and achieve high system load factor, etc.). Given that greatly expanded energy efficiency must be an essential component of any feasible strategy to tackle climate change, its absence in these current discussions is a serious missed opportunity.  Reducing GHG emissions needs to be a defining mission for utilities in the 21st century, and much greater utility sector transformation is needed to adequately utilize energy efficiency to achieve that mission.

Coming Soon: Largest US Scorecard Ever on City Clean Energy Efforts;"Next Thursday, ACEEE will release the 2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard, our most robust report ever to track city progress toward climate goals. While this is our fourth city scorecard, it is the first to assess cities’ efforts to advance renewable energy in addition to energy efficiency. It also scores more cities — 75 this year, compared to 51 in our last report in 2017 — and it takes a closer look at equity and policy performance.
The results? You’ll find out next week when we dive into the details. We’ll reveal which cities did best, which advanced their clean energy agendas since 2017, and which are on track to meet their climate goals (if they have them). Before we wonk out though, we want to take a step back and share stories of people working to increase energy efficiency and spur renewable energy use in some of the cities we assess.
ATTEND THE WEBINAR
We reached out to several cities asking them to nominate individuals or organizations to spotlight for their work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We were overwhelmed with the response. Below we share stories from Denver, San Francisco, Hartford, and New York. They tell inspiring stories of organizations — and people — working every day to make their communities stronger, healthier, and more resilient.
  Maceo May Veterans Apartments in San Francisco
This new construction project will provide 105 apartments to low-income and formerly homeless veterans and their families. Joanna Ladd of the Chinatown Community Development Center in San Francisco says Maceo May is one of two new buildings that her organization and Swords to Plowshares are currently developing to house 30-50% of the city’s homeless veterans.
 “We are always trying to push the envelope on energy efficiency in our buildings, because we own and operate them in perpetuity, and efficiency is our best insurance against rising utility rates,” says Ladd. “We are excited that the building will be receiving 100% renewable electricity from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and are taking full advantage by designing an all-electric building, supplemented with on-site photovoltaics, with no gas-powered building systems.”
Ladd adds, “With Maceo May, we also wanted to be sensitive about burdening our maintenance staff with overly complex building systems, since the maintenance of complex systems creates long-term costs as well. We settled on investing in a high-performance building envelope, with energy recovery ventilators providing tempered fresh air to each unit, to reduce the need for heating.""
Hartford Area Habitat for Humanity
The Hartford Area chapter of Habitat for Humanity is doing its part to build more sustainable homes in Connecticut’s capital city. To better understand its work, we interviewed the group’s executive director, Karraine Moody. She explains: “Thanks to energy efficiency expertise, our volunteers, and other partners, we achieved our goal of creating a more affordable housing option for the Hartford community. We are the first Habitat organization in Connecticut to build a Zero Energy Ready Home.”
Moody says an affordable, efficient home is critical for homeowners. “In most cases, they are moving from apartments in need of much repair, saddled with a non-performing furnace along with appliances that lack ENERGY STAR ratings. We have a workshop that focuses on…how to maintain their ENERGY STAR home. There is the a-ha moment in the workshop when they realize that the thermostat can be programmed to align with your daily routine and the gas bill should never reach $200 in any month.” 
The Habitat chapter will continue to build ENERGY STAR housing and plans to apply the lessons learned from its Zero Energy Ready Home to a development of six to eight homes.
Solar One in New York City
Cities are also working hard to spur renewable energy. To learn more about these efforts, we spoke to Noah Ginsburg, co-program director of Solar One in New York City, which has worked with more than 200 affordable housing projects to install solar.
“What I love about my work at Solar One is that it really is about the mission: we want to make sure that our transition to clean energy benefits everyone, all New Yorkers, regardless of their income, building type, or neighborhood,” says Ginsburg. “We view this work as dual impact; we want to bring the benefits of clean energy and utility savings to these communities, but it’s also about affordable housing preservation. New York City has a housing crisis, and if we can reduce operating expenses, it can have a huge impact and help blunt some of the larger market forces that are driving displacement and gentrification.”
Ginsburg notes that the city and the state of New York are passing ambitious clean energy goals, legislation, and policies, and that’s critical. “We absolutely need that,” he adds. “We feel really grateful to have a city and state that are committed to that mission and to positioning us to have success with our goals.”

Portman-Shaheen Bill Offers Needed Bipartisan Energy Solution;"Washington, DC—Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) introduced the bipartisan Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act. This legislation will improve building efficiency and reduce U.S. energy consumption and carbon emissions nationwide.
Steven Nadel, Executive Director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE):
“In the midst of scorched-earth partisan battles, we commend Senators Rob Portman and Jeanne Shaheen for introducing an energy efficiency bill that stands out as a commonsense, bipartisan solution. The Portman-Shaheen bill uses technology and best practices to save energy in homes, commercial buildings, and industry. The bill would result in better building energy codes, more aid to small manufacturing plants, and mortgage lending that recognizes the value of efficiency in homes. These are tangible energy efficiency solutions that transform waste into wealth by saving Americans money on their bills, all while improving the environment and the economy.”

How to Zero Out Emissions? More US States Use Energy Efficiency;"A growing number of states are adopting ambitious clean energy goals, aiming to zero out emissions in the power sector and, in some cases, the statewide economy.
In the past year, legislatures in California, Colorado, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Puerto Rico, and Washington have all passed bills aimed at making their state’s electricity sector carbon free by 2045-2050. More states have pledged to meet similar goals through executive orders and regulatory frameworks, most recently New Jersey, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. To date, 25 governors have signed on to the US Climate Alliance, pledging to reduce emissions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Using Efficiency to Meet Clean Energy Targets
While these goals mean transitioning to clean and renewable energy generation, each of these states will also need a big ramp up in energy efficiency to reach its targets. Energy efficiency reduces loads, cutting the amount (and therefore cost) of renewable energy needed to meet the goals. Efficiency also reduces energy needs on very hot and cold days, helping to aid grid reliability at times when the grid is most stressed. It is clear that states and regions will need to lean heavily on energy efficiency on the road to zero emissions. Many already are.
New Mexico was the third state to pass legislation requiring 100% of the state’s electricity generation to come from renewables, following California and Hawaii. During its 2019 legislative session, New Mexico also passed legislation that will extend its energy efficiency targets and help incentivize utilities to save energy.
Puerto Rico’s 100% renewable energy goal was passed arm-in-arm with a requirement to significantly ramp up energy efficiency in the territory, achieving 30% electricity savings by 2040.
Some states have worked through utilities and regulatory agencies to develop strategies for meeting aggressive clean energy goals in the power sector. In Minnesota, Governor Tim Walz has pushed for a transition to 100% clean electricity while pointing out that utilities are a key partner in this transition. Although the state legislature failed to pass the bill that would make the governor’s goal law, Xcel Energy, which serves more than 1.2 million electric customers and nearly half a million natural gas customers in Minnesota (as well as customers in seven other states), has a goal to be zero-carbon by 2050. The company recently committed to closing the last two coal plants it operates in the state and achieving enough energy efficiency to avoid construction of a new power plant.
Going Beyond the Power Sector
Some states are going beyond the power sector, setting economy-wide clean energy and emissions goals. While states have substantial experience setting mandatory clean energy and efficiency targets for utilities, they are in uncharted territory with economy-wide goals, which will require significantly more work to develop, track, and meet. ACEEE research has identified ways that energy efficiency can cut emissions in half across the economy, and states will need to adopt many of these strategies to meet their ambitious goals.
California passed legislation in 2018 calling for the state’s electric grid to be 100% carbon free by 2045. This builds on prior goals, including a requirement that the state generate 50% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2030 while doubling statewide energy savings. Governor Jerry Brown has also issued an executive order committing the state to economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045, an effort that will necessitate significant emissions reductions in the transportation sector. California has identified four pillars of decarbonization: shifting toward low-carbon fuels, electrifying buildings and vehicles, reducing other forms of emissions like methane leakage, and a major push for energy efficiency. As one of these key pillars, efficiency factors into every pathway the state might take to meet its aggressive decarbonization goals, according to a 2018 study commissioned by the California Energy Commission.
New York made waves in June with the passage of legislation calling for the state to rely on carbon-free electricity by 2040 and have a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. To help get there, the legislation calls for a 23% increase in energy efficiency. New York will likely need to ramp up efficiency to an even greater level, making major inroads into areas in which deep energy savings have historically been challenging to achieve, such as existing multifamily buildings. New York City is charting the course with the establishment of city-wide building energy performance standards earlier this year, which require large buildings to gradually improve their energy (and emissions) performance starting in 2024.
Other states are also pairing power-sector targets with broad economy-wide emissions reduction goals, getting closer — but not all the way — to zero emissions. In Colorado, a package of legislation codified Xcel Energy’s 100% renewable energy goal for electricity generation while also setting an economy-wide goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2050. And in New Jersey, state regulators released a draft Energy Master Plan in June that outlines a strategy for achieving 100% clean energy and 80% emissions reductions from 2006 levels by 2050. The plan highlights the importance of targeting the transportation sector, which accounts for 46% of the state’s emissions, and of ramping up energy efficiency through utility programs, building codes, and appliance standards.
These clean energy goals mean big changes for the way states generate energy. But they also mean big changes in the way we use energy. Getting to zero will require a backbone of deep energy savings in the power sector, reducing costs as more renewables are brought on line and ensuring energy is affordable for everyone. But it will also require looking at effective ways to reduce emissions and reduce energy usage in transportation and industry. States have set ambitious goals, but they now have a long road ahead to reach them.

Latest DOE Actions on Appliance Standards Will Cost Consumers and Increase Carbon Emissions;"Washington, DC—Today, the Department of Energy (DOE) reversed course and sided with the gas industry, at the expense of consumers, by indicating it plans to ignore energy-efficient condensing technology when developing future efficiency standards for gas furnaces and water heaters.
This decision is the latest in a series of DOE actions that undermine US appliance standards which save huge amounts of energy, lower bills for consumers and businesses, and reduce harmful pollution. In addition to this rule, DOE is also in the process of weakening national dishwasher standards, rolling back the light bulb standards, and providing a pathway for manufacturers to exempt themselves from product testing requirements.
Today’s ruling deals with efficient, condensing furnaces and water heaters that capture additional heat from the flue gases. A report from the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) found that condensing technology has the potential to save consumers and businesses over $100 billion on their utility bills by 2050.
The gas industry has argued for years that these more efficient units should be a separate product class, so manufacturers can continue selling wasteful, outdated models. Although DOE has disagreed with the gas industry’s argument as recently as 2016, it is now reversing its decision to side with the gas industry.
Steven Nadel, Executive Director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE):
“Condensing technology can reduce the energy use of products such as gas furnaces and water heaters by about 10-20%. The gas industry has sought to eliminate DOE’s consideration of condensing technology since at least the early 2000s, but until now, DOE, under both Bush and Obama administrations, had repeatedly rejected the gas industry’s arguments.”

The first proposed rule, published today, would benefit the gas industry at the expense of American consumers. This new rule, issued in response to a petition from the gas industry, would allow DOE to ignore condensing technology when developing future efficiency standards — creating a loophole for the industry to sell wasteful, outdated models.
Dishwasher Decision Pending
The second pending, proposed rule on dishwashers grants a petition from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a DC-based advocacy group. This plan is opposed by both manufacturers and energy efficiency advocates. The proposed rule would create a new product class for dishwashers with a cycle time of less than one hour.
CEI’s request is unwarranted because dishwashers that meet current standards and have the option of a short cycle are already widely available on the market. Dishwasher manufacturers today are providing consumers with wide-ranging choices of quiet, efficient machines that provide excellent washing performance while also providing the option of a short cycle.
It appears that the DOE will approve this new class of dishwashers in the coming weeks and assert that current standards on energy and water use will not apply to them. This move runs aground of the anti-backsliding law that prevents the weakening of appliance efficiency standards. If less-efficient dishwashers go to market, consumers will pay higher prices on their energy and water bills as a result.

Affordable Clean Energy Rule Misses Chance to Slash Carbon Emissions;"Statement of Steven Nadel, executive director
The Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE), announced today by the US Environmental Protection Agency, misses a large opportunity to slash carbon emissions, reduce air pollution, and save money. The rule recognizes that energy efficiency measures at power plants can reduce both carbon emissions and consumer utility bills, but it will deliver relatively few savings.
The EPA estimates it would reduce the power sector’s greenhouse gas emissions by 11 million short tons by 2030. While this may sound like a lot, it’s a small fraction of what could be saved. In fact, ACEEE analysis shows that energy efficiency policies and programs for customers could reduce power sector greenhouse gas emissions by 600 million tons by 2030, increase GDP by $17 billion, create 611,000 new jobs, and lower the average American’s utility bills — saving them twice as much as it costs to install new energy-efficient technologies.  
Utilities’ efficiency programs are cleaning the grid and saving money for families and businesses. They would have saved much more under the Obama’s administration Clean Power Plan (CPP), which the ACE will replace. Even without federal backing, states should still ensure their utilities and agencies are implementing all cost-effective energy efficiency to help their families, their economy, and their environment.

Here Are Six Ways We Have Slashed US Energy Use by a Fifth;"Major energy efficiency policies slashed US energy use by about 20% in 2017, saving a whopping 25 quads of energy —the amount used in California, Texas, and Florida combined.
Two US policies now at risk accounted for the majority of these savings. Vehicle fuel economy standards and appliance efficiency standards saved 14.3 quadrillion Btus, about 60% of the total savings and about 14% of all US energy use. Unfortunately, the Trump administration is proposing to roll them back (see here and here).
Savings from six key efficiency policies increased more than 15% since 2014, when we last compiled our estimates. Savings in 2017 (listed in the table below) give a sense of the scale of efficiency’s impacts. Note that the estimate for each policy uses a different methodology, so the savings may not be fully comparable.
The figures total 26 quads, but I round down to 25 quads to allow for some overlap in savings estimates. These estimates, though, do not include savings from many other, mostly smaller, energy efficiency policies.
Here are six major policies that have dramatically reduced US energy use and the accompanying carbon dioxide emissions:
Vehicle standards
Fuel economy standards for cars, minivans, and SUVs, which first took effect in 1978 under legislation passed by President Gerald Ford, generated the largest energy savings in 2017. They saved an estimated 9.0 quads, according to figures by the US Department of Transportation. We add savings of 0.3 quads (ACEEE calculations) from heavy-duty vehicle standards that were enacted under President George W. Bush in 2005. New savings from vehicle standards are expected to grow substantially through 2020 as a result of revisions established by the Obama administration. Further progress on passenger vehicles will depend on whether the Trump administration follows through on a proposal to freeze standards at 2020 levels, and if it does, whether the courts sustain such a freeze.
Appliance and equipment standards
The second-largest savings, 6.0 quads, come from minimum efficiency standards on appliances and other types of energy-using equipment. These estimates come from a 2017 report with updates by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which is based at ACEEE. Congress has enacted standards on more than 50 products, beginning with legislation signed by President Ronald Reagan. The US Department of Energy (DOE) periodically revises these standards. Unfortunately progress has stalled the past few years as rulemakings have slowed to a crawl and, in the case of light bulb standards, the Trump administration has proposed a rollback.
ENERGY STAR®
Third on the list is the ENERGY STAR program, including ENERGY STAR homes, buildings, and equipment. ENERGY STAR has operated for more than 20 years, steadily expanding its market reach and participation levels. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that this program saved about 370 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity in 2017, which is equivalent to 3.7 quads. EPA estimates an additional 0.5 quads of savings in direct fossil fuel use in homes, buildings, and industry, for a total of 4.2 quads of savings.
Utility sector energy efficiency programs
Fourth is energy efficiency programs funded by utility customers and operated by either the utilities themselves or other entities designated by states and utilities. These programs help utility customers save energy and reduce their bills. They also help the utility and all ratepayers, because saving a kWh is generally less expensive than generating a kWh. These programs, begun in the late 1970s in a few states, have expanded over the years and are now offered by utilities in most states. In 2017, these programs saved about 242 billion kWh and 400 trillion Btus of natural gas for a total of 2.7 quads. The electricity data come from ACEEE’s State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. The gas data come from our 2017 report on natural gas efficiency and also include more recent data from our State Scorecard.
Federal RD&D
Federal government energy efficiency research, development, and deployment (RD&D) appears to produce a similar level of savings as utility programs, but this estimate is very uncertain. Our figure is based on 2017 estimated savings from a 2001study, which in turn is based on work by the National Academy of Sciences and the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. DOE has a substantial energy efficiency RD&D effort that has contributed to such energy-saving products as LED lighting, industrial process innovation, heavy-duty vehicle fuel economy improvements, electronic ballasts for fluorescent lamps, windows with special heat-reflective coatings, and advanced building analytic software. DOE has conducted more recent evaluations on specific RD&D projects but has not estimated the overall savings and other benefits from its RD&D program.
Building codes
Building energy codes are next on the list, saving an estimated 1.5 quads in 2017. The first energy codes were developed in the 1970s, and code stringency has steadily increased since then, driven by new technologies and practices, as well consumer economics. Compared to 1980 codes, current national model building codes reduce energy use by nearly 40% (residential) to 50% (commercial). Most states adopt one of these model codes as a statewide code, and some cities also adopt codes. Our energy savings estimate comes from our 2014 analysis, with the addition of savings for 2015–2017 from the same sources. This estimate is highly approximate.
Caveats
These estimates, which are approximate, come from a variety of sources and employ different methodologies. Some, such as for RD&D and building codes, are highly approximate. Also, some savings estimates overlap, such as ENERGY STAR and utility sector programs. We crudely adjusted for this overlap by rounding down the total, but please note that this adjustment is inexact.

DOE Refuses Public Hearing on a Proposal That Could Gut US Appliance Standards;"UPDATE (June 26): After receiving our renewed public hearing request and similar requests from a number of manufacturers and AHRI, an industry trade group, DOE decided to hold a 2-hour public webinar on Thursday, July 11th from 9 to 11 eastern time. Comments are due two business days after the public hearing, on Monday July 15th. Details here.  
The Department of Energy (DOE) has quietly issued a proposal that could seriously undermine US energy efficiency standards for many appliances and products — everything from air conditioners and refrigerators to light bulbs and electric motors. Last month, it proposed a rule that would allow individual manufacturers to secretly opt out of testing requirements.
Who would lose out? Competitors who play by the rules and the consumers and businesses unknowingly saddled with purchases that fail to meet minimum standards, wasting energy and money.
The proposal, which would change how manufacturers can be exempted from federal test procedure requirements, caught energy efficiency supporters and manufacturers alike by surprise. In response, ASAP and nine other organizations that participate in DOE’s regulatory processes requested a public meeting for DOE to better explain the proposal and receive input.
DOE had always allowed for public meetings on proposed test procedure changes for specific products in the past. Surely, a proposal that would affect every product’s test procedure and compliance would merit the enhanced scrutiny of a public meeting. To our shock, DOE staff refused. Twice.
Today, we renewed our request in a letter to Assistant Secretary Daniel Simmons and DOE General Counsel Bill Cooper, urging them to reverse course and hold a public meeting on the proposed rule. The details of this proposal are way too important to shortchange the public review process.
A back door for opting out of compliance
All products subject to federal efficiency standards must be certified as meeting the applicable standard based on a uniform test procedure. These test procedures are at the heart of a fair and reliable national appliance standards program. They provide the rules of the road, assuring a level playing field for competitors and giving consumers and businesses confidence that products meet standards and attain the efficiency performance advertised.
Because it is not possible to predict all the future designs and product features that manufacturers may introduce, some new products either cannot be tested with the existing procedure or the existing test does not adequately represent the product’s energy consumption. Therefore, DOE regulations allow manufacturers to apply for waivers to test their products using an alternate procedure that accounts for the specific new features.
These waivers ensure that innovation is not inhibited, while at the same time protecting the integrity of the appliance standards program. A manufacturer can request an interim waiver to use during the time that DOE is evaluating and making a final determination on the waiver application. DOE has approved most recent waiver applications after review. The current system seems, with a couple of exceptions, to have encouraged well-thought-out applications.
Under the proposed rule, an interim test procedure waiver would be deemed granted if DOE does not act on a manufacturer’s request within 30 days. Because the recent history of waiver applications indicates that it is difficult for DOE to respond to such requests within 30 days, interim waivers would in many, if not most cases be automatically granted under DOE’s proposal.
The proposal does not require that applications be complete, that the proposed alternate test be fair, or that a manufacturer even propose an alternate test. A manufacturer could just stop testing altogether. A skewed test or failure to test at all is a back door for opting out of compliance with national standards.
No one would even know. Because a waiver would be deemed granted, the proposal requires no affirmative notice to competitors or the public that the manufacturer is no longer playing by the same rules as everyone else.
Even if DOE determines later that a manufacturer’s application should be rejected, under the proposed rule, that manufacturer would be given a 180-day grace period before being required to use the uniform DOE test procedure. In other words, it would receive six more months to continue selling non-compliant products that unfairly undercut the competition and potentially harm buyers. During that time, the manufacturer could submit a new application, perhaps simply changing model numbers, and would receive a new waiver if DOE fails to deny the application quickly.
Why is this such a big deal?
A manufacturer or importer that can dictate its own test procedure — or simply not test — can cheat with impunity. While most manufacturers play by the rules, cheating happens. In just the past year, DOE levied fines against eight companies for non-compliance. In an older case, a manufacturer designed its refrigerators to recognize test conditions and shut down some energy-using features during efficiency tests. It got caught and paid fines. In vehicle emissions, Volkswagen famously circumvented that test and paid billions in fines.
By making waivers automatic and keeping them secret, DOE’s proposal invites abuse. All a manufacturer or importer would need do is put a skewed alternate test in an application, or propose no test procedure, and wait 30 days to start selling. And unlike the cases of the refrigerator manufacturer and VW, the cheating would be perfectly legal.
Either DOE has not thought through its proposal very carefully or its commitment to a fair and consistent application of existing national energy conservation standards has faltered. In either case, given the sweep of its potential impact, this proposed rule should get the full scrutiny of a public meeting.

Cannabis and Indoor Agriculture Can Slash Overhead Costs With Energy Efficiency;"As the market for indoor agriculture in North America surges, businesses, growers, and states are finding innovative ways to slash energy costs that demonstrate the potential for much greater savings.
Indoor agriculture — primarily flowers, herbs, lettuces, tomatoes, berries, and cannabis in greenhouses and other buildings — is a rapidly expanding and evolving industry across North America. Known as controlled environment agriculture (CEA), this energy-intensive industry was valued at roughly $47 billion in 2017. While its compound annual growth rate is projected at 3.4% for 2018-2023, some markets anticipate even faster growth, such as cannabis, with a projected 14.4% annual increase through 2025. As the industry expands, so does its energy use.
The latest issue brief in our Emerging Opportunities in Buildings series provides a snapshot of energy consumption in CEA facilities and the significant efficiency opportunities available. Reducing energy costs is vital to the industry’s success, because they account for as much as 25% of operating costs.
Efficiency investments can provide an important boost to the bottom line. While the food and flower crops grown in CEA facilities are typically higher in value than commodity crops, margins for growers are still relatively low. And in the cannabis sector, experience has shown that the high prices common when a state first legalizes adult use tend to collapse after a few years as the market becomes saturated and stabilizes.
Working closely with growers, equipment manufacturers have developed efficient LED lighting systems for different facility types including greenhouses, single-tier container farms, and multi-layer stacked vertical farms. HVAC manufacturers are producing specialized equipment to provide the precise climate, humidity, and airflow required for plant health, pest control, and mold prevention. These technologies allow growers to produce multiple crops over the course of the year and, in some cases, to produce significantly more product per acre of land and gallon of water than traditional agriculture.
These technical developments can reduce energy use by 30-50% or more, but substantial barriers have limited their broad adoption. Like many new industries, CEA faces a lack of access to capital as businesses work to demonstrate profitability to lenders and investors. Capital constraints are even more pronounced for cannabis growers, given federal limitations on banking for the cannabis industry. Limited data on energy use make it harder for growers to weigh the potential benefits of energy efficiency investments against perceived risks associated with adopting new technologies and practices or dealing with the disruptions of a retrofit project.
Fortunately, new programs and initiatives are emerging to address these barriers and support energy efficiency in CEA. Efficiency programs across the United States and Canada are offering technical assistance to growers along with incentives to offset the cost of efficiency investments and address capital constraints. The US Environmental Protection Agency recognizes indoor agriculture facilities that reduce their energy intensity through the ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry. Additional resources and recognition for these facilities are under consideration.
The DesignLights Consortium has added a specification to its portfolio that helps growers, contractors, programs, and policymakers to identify high-quality, efficient lighting for CEA facilities. Similar specifications could do the same for HVAC and dehumidification equipment used in indoor agriculture.
In the cannabis industry, the Resource Innovation Institute offers educational programming on sustainable cannabis production and a benchmarking tool for growers seeking to gauge their energy performance relative to others. It is also developing best practice guides for lighting and HVAC design and operation.
To date, some degree of separation exists among programs, policies, and other initiatives for energy efficiency and sustainability in cannabis facilities and those in food and flower production. While different crops have different requirements, there are opportunities for collaboration and greater information-sharing across the CEA industry.
Policy can also play a role in reducing the energy impacts of the industry as it continues to grow and mature. State and municipal policymakers are beginning to establish energy use disclosure and other energy efficiency requirements on cannabis facilities. Similar policies for all CEA facilities, offered in conjunction with technical assistance and incentive programs, could help growers improve their viability while reducing their energy and environmental impact.  
Today we are also releasing an issue brief on residential dual-fuel program opportunities. While most energy efficiency programs target only one fuel, typically electricity or natural gas, dual-fuel programs have shown that broadening offerings to target multiple fuels can save more energy, reduce program costs, and improve customer satisfaction. This brief highlights best practices for dual-fuel programs, as well as innovative program approaches and technologies that can unlock deeper savings across multiple fuels.

Nevada Joins States Opposing Light Bulb Rollback;"Joint statement by ACEEE’s Jennifer Amann, ASAP’s Andrew deLaski, and SWEEP’s Tom Polikilas
Washington, DC—Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak signed AB54 into law this week, pushing back against the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back energy-saving light bulb standards by adopting federal standards into state law. The measure will safeguard millions of dollars in consumer savings from the federal government’s misguided attack on efficient light bulbs.
Jennifer Amann, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE)’s buildings program director:
“Nevadans are helping to hold the line against the administration’s proposed rollback of light bulb standards. This bill will not only save Nevadans more than $85 million in electric bills, but it will also help reduce carbon equal to a year’s emissions from 60,000 cars from entering our atmosphere and destroying our climate.”
Andrew deLaski, Appliance Standards Awareness Project’s (ASAP) executive director:
“Just when the Trump administration seems dead set on a senseless rollback of federal light bulb standards, Nevada is joining other states in stepping into the breach to ensure their residents will get the energy- and bill-saving benefits of these commonsense standards.”
Tom Polikalas, Nevada Representative, Southwest Energy Efficiency Project’s (SWEEP)
 “AB 54 will ensure that Nevadans obtain and benefit from energy-efficient light bulbs, even if the Trump Administration proceeds with its proposed rollback of efficiency standards on reflector and other specialty lamps. SWEEP applauds the Nevada Governor’s energy office for proposing this bill, and the legislature for adopting it.”
Nevada will become the fourth state after Vermont (H.411 from 2017), Washington (HB1444 enacted this month) and California (existing regulations already apply 2020 federal standards to some bulbs sold in state) to put the federal light bulb standards into state law.
A bill with the same anti-rollback measure (HB19-1231) is sitting on Colorado Governor Jared Polis' desk, and he is expected to sign it Thursday, May 30th.
California has a regulatory proceeding underway to expand the range of bulbs subject to their state standards to match the broader federal scope of coverage that the Trump DOE has proposed to eliminate.
Several other states are considering similar measures, at various stages of development.
According to ASAP, in 2025 alone, keeping the light bulb standards in place for Nevada will:
Save Nevadans more than $85 million in electricity bills
Save an average of $80 dollars per household
Reduce global warming CO2 emissions by 280,000 metric tons, equal to a year’s emissions from 60,000 cars

Fuel Economy Gains, Now at Risk, Reduce Cost of Summer Road Trips;"As nearly 43 million Americans hit the road over Memorial Day weekend, they will see firsthand how improved fuel economy saves them money. Put simply, they won’t have to stop as often or spend as much for gas, leaving more time and money for summer fun.
Despite the soaring popularity of crossovers and sport utility vehicles, cars and trucks on average have improved fuel economy over the past 10 years. In fact, the average model year 2018 vehicle is expected to hit 25.4 miles per gallon (up from 21 mpg in 2008), with more efficient options available for every vehicle type.
The resulting fuel savings can be quite substantial. Take the Honda CR-V, the highest-selling SUV last year. Its all-wheel drive model had a maximum fuel economy rating of 22 mpg in 2008 but now gets 29 mpg — a 32% improvement. So for every 1,000 miles, a 2019 AWD CR-V uses 11 fewer gallons of gas.
As a result, a roundtrip cross-country road trip in a new CR-V — from Washington, D.C., to the waters of Malibu Beach, California, for example — would save $178 at current gas prices. Consumers opting for a hybrid option, like the 40 mpg hybrid Toyota RAV4, could save a lot more.
This comparison demonstrates the real-world benefits of increased fuel economy: guaranteed savings at the pump, a smaller impact on families’ budgets when gas prices rise, and less harmful pollution from vehicle exhausts. We use the SUV and crossover examples because of their sheer popularity, but nearly all new mainstream cars, trucks, and SUVs offer substantial savings over the older models they replace.
Owners of used cars can also benefit from fuel economy standards. Because fuel economy has been steadily improving for almost a decade, more efficient vehicles have become widely available in the used car market. You can easily explore vehicle options at greenercars.org and calculate your own potential fuel savings with the vehicles of your choice using the fueleconomy.gov trip calculator.
Fuel economy gains of this magnitude wouldn’t occur without fuel economy standards. But the US administration, using faulty data, is planning to roll back those standards for vehicle model years 2021-2025 and to take away a state’s right to independently set its own air quality standards.
If the fuel economy standards are rolled back to 2020 levels, drivers will spend more money at the pump for years to come and will be more vulnerable to fluctuating gas prices. But if standards remain in place, a small SUV meeting model year 2025 fuel economy requirements would average about 37 MPG, saving $55 and 18 gallons of gas for every 1,000 miles driven, compared to the 2008 model. Our fuel economy standards need to remain in place to keep good, old-fashioned road trips affordable for American families.

For Existing Homes, Energy Efficiency Often Has a Better Return on Investment Than Solar;"Looking for an investment with a high, secure return on investment? A light energy efficiency retrofit of a typical existing home can deliver a whopping 18.5% return annually, nearly double that of long-term stocks. It’s also a much higher return than that of residential rooftop solar, though they both deliver complementary cuts in carbon emissions that are necessary to address the climate challenge.
Ideally, homeowners will combine energy efficiency and solar, using the former to reduce energy demand and improve comfort, and then adding the latter to serve the now-smaller power load. If their budget is limited, though, homeowners will often get a bigger bang for their buck by prioritizing efficiency. We documented this finding in a recent blog post and paper by ACEEE’s Chris Perry about new home construction.
In today’s post, we explore the economics of efficiency and solar for an average existing home. We find that a light efficiency retrofit, which reduces energy use by 10%, has the best return on investment. A medium efficiency retrofit saves more energy (29%), but because of its higher cost, has a lower return. Its return is similar to that of solar with net metering at a fixed rate — that is, when homeowners sell the excess electricity generated from their rooftop arrays back to the grid at a fixed retail power price.
Not surprisingly, a deep efficiency retrofit saves the most energy but takes longer to pay back. Its return is similar to solar with net metering and typical time-of-use rates — when homeowners sell their excess power back to the grid at a rate that varies based on time of day. (They often earn less from their solar with a varying rate than a flat one.)
We based our analysis on the energy use of an average American home that uses about 11,500 kWh of electricity and 400 therms of natural gas each year. For solar, we use St. Louis weather, which is about average for the United States. Our costs and savings for the light retrofit, which includes sealing air leaks and other low-cost efficiency measures, are based on the Connecticut Home Energy Solutions program. For this retrofit, the annual energy savings are worth $185, providing an 18.5% annual return on the $1,000 retrofit cost. Additional details on the assumptions, calculations, and sources can be found here.
This rate of return is much better than the approximately 2% annual return paid by banks or money market funds and nearly double the approximately 10% long-term returns by the stock market.
Rates of return on various efficiency and solar investments are summarized in the table below:
We based our medium efficiency retrofit on a US Department of Energy study of comprehensive home retrofits in New Jersey. The study’s average retrofit cost is about $14,000, including new furnaces and air conditioners that would have to be replaced eventually. To account for this, we applied a discounted credit of $5,600 for the value of this avoided replacement, five years in the future. After this credit, the return on investment is 5.8% per year – better than the bank and lower risk than the stock market.
Our deep efficiency retrofit, based on the Vermont Zero Energy Now program, achieves 79% average energy savings (sometimes including solar) at an average cost per home of $41,200. (Because this includes HVAC, we applied the same credit for future replacement). The return on investment, 4.0% per year, is double what a bank will pay. But if a home renovation occurs at the same time, the combined costs can often be reduced and efficiency’s rate of return increased.
Turning now to solar, we look at an 8.23 kW system – enough to serve the annual electricity use of our average US home, based again on St. Louis solar conditions. This system costs about $26,600 without a battery backup. We don’t include solar incentives, just as we didn’t include efficiency incentives. We also note that the residential federal solar tax credit is due to expire soon. With net metering at the US annual average electricity price of nearly 13 cents per kWh, the system saves $1,480 per year for a 5.6% return on investment. This is similar to the return on the medium efficiency retrofit.
But if the net metering is based on time-of-use rates, the annual system savings decline, because daytime power can be worth less than evening power, which is more in demand. (Hawaii now uses these variable rates, and other states are starting to do so, as well.) Under this type of net metering, the value of net metering declines by more than $600 per year in Hawaii, but by about $440 in the United States overall, adjusting for differences in power prices and energy use. This reduces the return on investment to 3.9%, not quite as good as the return on the medium efficiency retrofit.
And if there is no net metering and excess power is sold back to the utility at 4.5 cents per kWh (a typical utility avoided cost), the solar systems save about $547 per year, a 2.5% return on investment, similar to the bank and not quite as good as the deep retrofit.
We base our analysis on US averages. Energy use, energy rates, solar insolation, fuel mix, and solar costs vary widely among regions and homes. We recommend additional analysis to cover a much wider range of conditions. But this simple analysis suggests that light efficiency retrofits are likely to make sense for most homes and that medium efficiency retrofits and solar with net metering make sense for many homes. We also find that the existence and type of net metering can have a substantial impact on the rate of return for solar investments. In addition, we find that deep retrofits may make more sense when done as part of larger home renovations than as energy-only projects. Lastly, efficiency and solar are nice complements; reducing loads with efficiency and then serving remaining loads with solar can maximize cost savings and greenhouse gas reductions.

Prepay: Saving Electricity and Money or Going Without?;"As more utilities look at prepay plans, new research finds this option carries both benefits and potential risks. While it may put at risk the wellbeing of some customers trying to save money, it can also lower electricity use and garner customer satisfaction.
The report, by ACEEE and energy nonprofit Slipstream, explores programs that require customers to pay in advance of receiving electricity. The idea is controversial because when a customer’s balance reaches zero, their electricity is shut off until they recharge their account. Traditional plans allow a grace period for payment and permit customers to go into the red before they are eventually disconnected (with plenty of notice), but prepay plans skirt these requirements.
The issues are compounded because customers on prepay plans also tend to have lower incomes and are more likely to let their electricity be shut off to save money. However, in North America, prepay programs also generally come with detailed and frequent real-time feedback that encourages customers to learn about their energy use.
Although these programs are generally not well researched, we found 16 program evaluations in 10 reports that suggest customers reduce their consumption by about 9% when on prepay plans. We complemented this research with stakeholder and expert interviews and reviews of regulatory proceedings. We concluded that prepay programs are likely to reduce energy use, but we aren’t sure why.
None of the evaluations from North American prepay plans used a randomized control design or examined the individual features of the programs. It’s possible that certain aspects of the programs —such as enhanced frequent feedback — may lead to the bulk of savings. So prepay itself may not be a necessary program component to reduce energy use. Based on our research, however, we suspect that feedback with prepay may be more effective than feedback alone.
How prepay plans reduce energy use
Multiple factors work together in prepay programs to influence energy use. The combination of enhanced feedback and a threat of shut-off is particularly likely to reduce energy use. But without further research, we can’t be sure of the impact of each on program savings. Other factors inherent to prepay plans, such as more frequent payments, active decision making for payment, higher costs (for some prepay programs), and paying in advance may also play a role in influencing savings.
If shutoff threats really influence energy reductions, then are prepay programs threatening quality of life? Are some customers putting their well-being at risk by drastically reducing their energy use to save money? These are important questions, because most prepay customers have lower incomes and are more likely to allow an electricity shutoff to save money.
We found that customers on prepay plans tend to have their power shut off more frequently than those on postpay plans. But we also found that prepay customers tend to be happy with their service. These seemingly contradictory conclusions may stem partly from the failure of traditional postpay plans to adequately meet customers’ needs (sometimes shutting customers off for extended periods) and the fact that most prepay plans are currently opt-in (with no surveys of customers who have switched back from prepay to postpay). Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to consider that customers on prepay plans generally like them.
Prepay plans and customer behavior
A few studies have found that prepay customers are typically motivated to learn about their energy use and subsequently ration their consumption. That said, prepay plans generally may not reduce energy burdens for low-income customers (and the plans can be more expensive). Prepay allows for flexibility and encourages control over energy budgets, but this may also put extremely budget-constrained customers at risk. Struggling households may occasionally cut their bills by allowing their electricity credit to run out, and this can pose a risk to their health and safety.
Prepay electricity programs are a normal arrangement in many other regions of the world and are likely to continue to proliferate in North America. But are these programs reducing consumption in a manner that can be considered energy efficiency? Given that the definition of energy efficiency in Minnesota and elsewhere includes a provision that the same level of service is provided with less energy, the jury is still out on this question. Competing issues of energy reductions, reasons for reductions, and consumer protections should continue to be examined in greater detail.
You can learn more about these important topics in the ACEEE/Slipstream report, Examining Potential for Prepay as an Energy Efficiency Program in Minnesota, or the accompanying fact sheet and webinar.

Deep Retrofits: Financing Needs to Play a Critical Role;"This is the fourth and final blog post in our series on recent developments in energy efficiency financing. Prior posts covered Energy Service Agreements, PACE Financing, and on-bill finance.
Deep retrofits to existing buildings will be critical for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions over the next 30 years. But such retrofits can be expensive, so financing is vital for unlocking energy savings. Several recent projects illustrate innovative ways to finance these retrofits.
In 2050, roughly half the US building stock will be buildings that are standing today (see figure below). Yes, we can and should build new buildings well, but we will also need to substantially reduce energy use and emissions from existing buildings. Typical building retrofits reduce energy use by 10-25%, but deep retrofits save at least 30%, sometimes more than 50%.

Government projects use ESPCs
The US government is using one kind of financing tool for deep building projects – Energy Saving Performance Contracts (ESPCs). With ESPCs, an energy service company (ESCo) designs projects, finances them, and oversees both their initial installation and ongoing maintenance. The ESCo is paid based on the actual energy savings. The General Services Administration (GSA) used ESPCs to finance deep retrofits on seven buildings across the United States, achieving an average energy use reduction of 58%.
In the GSA effort, a different energy service company was involved in each project. The projects typically involved major building renovations. To finance deep retrofits, energy performance contract terms were typically 25 years, the longest permitted for federal government projects. In one example, a comprehensive retrofit of a federal office building in New Carrollton, MD, the retrofit included a new central chilled water plant, integrative building controls and sensors, geothermal heat rejection, an exhaust to outdoor air heat recovery loop, LED lighting, and an 808 kW solar PV array that together reduced building energy use by 60%. The ESCo (Ameresco) invested a total of $40 million and estimates energy savings to be $2.5 million per year. A key component of the project was to reduce building loads, allowing the chiller to be downsized by 40% relative to the pre-retrofit system.
A report on the seven GSA projects identified six retrofit lessons:
Set aggressive long-term goals.
Engage and collaborate with diverse stakeholders.
Establish a support system.
Start with a clean sheet and a beginner’s mind.
Use an iterative, holistic design process.
Incorporate feedback and ongoing involvement.
Johnson Controls tries various financial models
More recently, Johnson Controls International (JCI), one of the United States’ largest ESCos, has undertaken deep retrofit projects with several large institutional customers, including the Hawaii Department of Transportation, the University of Hawaii Maui, Samford University (a private university in Alabama) and the city of Evansville, IN. These projects all involved integrated packages of measures that together reduced energy use by 32-45%. All involved 20-year ESPCs, but in some cases, they used innovative financial models to serve unique project needs.
These include:
Power purchase agreements: The University of Hawaii agreed to purchase power from an on-site solar project developed by JCI and a utility partner.
Contingent payments: Samford University payments are contingent on measured savings.
Tax-exempt lease purchase: The municipality of Marquette, MI, pays for infrastructure improvements through annual lease payments paid through savings.
Public-private partnership agreement: The University of North Dakota and JCI created a partnership for a 40-year design-build-operate-maintain central plant project.
These examples pertain to commercial buildings, but another company, Sealed, has other plans. As ACEEE discussed in a recent blog post on energy service agreements, Sealed is hoping to combine utility incentive programs with energy service agreements for deep retrofits of single-family homes.
Given the importance of slashing energy use and emissions, additional financing strategies for deep retrofits are likely to develop in the coming years. ACEEE plans to keep abreast of and report on these developments.

Virginia’s Improved Efficiency Offerings Model Success for the Southeast;"Virginia has recently made a major leap forward on energy efficiency and can serve as a successful model for utility efforts under consideration in Southeast states, including Louisiana, North Carolina, and Florida.
Virginia’s State Corporation Commission (SCC) issued a landmark order last week that approved a package of 11 new energy efficiency and demand response programs from the state’s biggest utility, Dominion Energy Virginia. Set to begin this summer and run through mid-2024, these programs will invest $225 million in customer programs and will deliver lower bills, greater comfort, and safer homes and workplaces for Virginia customers.
This action builds on Virginia’s 2018 Grid Transformation and Security Act (GTSA) and more than a decade of groundwork by energy efficiency advocates. It demonstrates how state legislatures, commissions, and utilities can show leadership in delivering the benefits of energy efficiency to customers. Other states in the region are poised to make critical decisions for energy efficiency. Will they follow Virginia’s lead?
Dominion’s increased commitment
Virginia’s utilities have long struggled to deliver the benefits of energy efficiency to customers. Dominion ranked 50 out of 51 utilities in the 2017 Utility Energy Efficiency Scorecard. However, with the GTSA’s passage, Dominion and neighboring Appalachian Power must together propose more than $1 billion for energy efficiency programs through 2028, with $870 million from Dominion alone. The legislation called for a good-faith commitment from Dominion to propose these programs, but did not guarantee regulatory approval.
Dominion submitted a proposal last October that was an acceptable first step, a 53% increase in investment in energy efficiency over its 2018 portfolio. It includes the first programs for Dominion residents in more than two years. However the proposal also counted “lost revenues” — the sunk costs of past infrastructure investments — into program costs, thereby potentially decreasing Dominion’s efficiency investment for customers.
The Virginia Energy Efficiency Council, with ACEEE as its expert witness, got involved in the recent proceeding to lend support for Dominion’s proposed programs and ensure that all the funding designated for energy efficiency directly benefit customers. 
ACEEE is pleased that SCC approved all of Dominion’s proposed programs. The commission followed the GTSA’s new requirements, approving all programs that passed three of four cost-effectiveness tests and taking a more expansive view of program benefits than in the past. After pressure from the governor and lawmakers, Dominion also stepped forward to clarify that it plans to spend all of the $870 million on customer benefits, exclusive of lost revenues.
More work ahead 
Dominion will now need to demonstrate the success of these programs and scale them. Our analysis estimated that the proposed programs would get only about 40% of the way to the $870M spending commitment, so Dominion’s programs will need to expand to reach more customers and deliver deeper energy efficiency savings.
Despite recent progress on utility programs, other obstacles remain. Last week, Governor Ralph Northam signed a state budget with language from legislators that hampers Virginia’s ability to participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a regional program to limit carbon emissions. However, the Department of Environmental Quality intends to research ways to implement carbon-reduction plans.
Other opportunities in the Southeast 
Dominion and the SCC offer a successful model for utility opportunities in other Southeast states, many of which are considering whether to expand access to energy efficiency for customers.
Louisiana recently kicked off a process to expand its “Phase I” programs into more comprehensive portfolios of energy efficiency programs. The proposed rules are a start, but the state will need to do more to really deliver on their potential. Over the course of the summer, the commission should be prepared to consider a “three-legged stool” approach. This includes setting savings goals and modifying the utilities’ business model to motivate them to invest in energy efficiency.
North Carolina has multiple avenues for advancing energy efficiency in the coming months. Last year, Governor Roy Cooper signed Executive Order 80, signaling the state’s commitment to addressing climate change. As a part of that order, the Department of Environmental Quality will create a Clean Energy Plan to foster the deployment of clean energy resources, including energy efficiency. This summer, stakeholders can participate in listening sessions or submit written comments. In addition, the current demand-side management business model incentives for Duke Energy are up for review before the NC Utilities Commission. This docket creates an opportunity to ensure that energy efficiency aligns with its business model and that existing incentives will result in energy savings for customers. 
In Florida, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (FEECA) calls on utilities to set goals every five years. Unfortunately, plans for programs submitted last month have shrunk to almost nothing for multiple utilities, depriving customers of the programs they need to manage electric bills and reduce system costs. The commission can demonstrate leadership by eliminating two barriers. Florida has restrictive cost-effectiveness tests, which include irrelevant costs and discount important benefits, and unnecessary payback screens, which only allow measures that take customers a long time to pay off. These changes would expand the energy efficiency services utilities can offer customers.
Louisiana, North Carolina, and Florida have some of the best potential to deliver energy efficiency for customers in the United States. If regulators, policymakers, and utilities in these states successfully follow Virginia’s lead, local families and businesses will be able to tap into the benefits of this crucial resource. However, if they fail to set strong energy efficiency goals and do not address the utility business model, Southeastern communities will miss out on this opportunity.

Portland’s Cutting-Edge Tool for Home Buyers Gains Momentum in Other US Cities;"Ever wonder how much a home’s utility bills will cost before you buy it? Portland, Oregon, has a cutting-edge policy that gives homebuyers such information, enabling them to consider energy efficiency when buying a home, just as many consumers do when shopping for a car. Other cities are looking at similar programs.
Portland is one of a few US cities to require home sellers to disclose energy information to buyers and is the first US city to require home sellers to receive and disclose a Home Energy Score in real estate listings. This score, developed by the US Department of Energy, explains how homes perform compared to others in the United States. To receive a score, homeowners must hire a certified assessor to perform an energy audit that scores their home on a scale of 1 to 10.
Last year, the policy’s first, the city scored 10,000 homes and found an average score of 4.6, slightly below the US average of 5.0. Many homes in Portland were built in the early 1900s, long before building codes set efficiency requirements. These older homes often receive low scores, because they have little insulation, old windows, and inefficient HVAC systems. But they also have the most to gain; many can improve their performance 20-30% with cost-effective measures.
Other US cities are implementing or considering similar policies to help their residents better value energy efficiency. Since 2009, Austin, Texas, requires homes that are 10 or more years old to receive an energy audit and disclose it when listing the property. In 2015, Berkeley, California, began requiring sellers to receive a home energy score and disclose it to the buyer at or shortly after the time of sale. Montgomery County, Maryland, and Chicago have requirements to disclose utility bills to home purchasers; Chicago also encourages (but does not require) including this information in listings. This February, Minneapolis passed a law to require a rating at time of listing as well as a disclosure policy targeting rental properties.
Look for the home label
By requiring home sellers to disclose energy scores, Portland is bringing more transparency and energy awareness to the market. It has developed tools, notably the home energy score label (see below), to help people quickly and easily compare homes.
Buyers can also find home energy scores through the green building registry map tool, seen below. They can plug in an address to look up a home’s score and also see how other homes in the neighborhood perform.
The city aims to nudge home buyers to consider energy efficiency alongside other features such as floor plans or number of bedrooms. Similar labels have successfully helped consumers value efficiency. For example, ACEEE research on the impact of fuel economy labels shows that car buyers now consider efficiency just as important as price, reliability, and safety. Research in Europe finds that higher home energy ratings result in higher sales prices. And research in Chicago shows that listings that disclose energy use sell more quickly.
Some owners are already using their home energy reports to make improvements. One homeowner, despite having a high-efficiency furnace and new windows, received the lowest score of 1. The report revealed that her home had little attic or wall insulation and an inefficient water heater, which explained why she felt her living room would get hotter throughout the summer. Working with a contractor, she improved her home’s insulation and replaced her old water heater for less than $10,000. Now her home has a score of 7. 
Portland wants to encourage more home improvements. New buyers are a particularly important target, because they often make improvements within the first two years of moving, spending twice as much on home repairs as non-movers. The city estimates the average homeowner could save $303 per year by making the improvements recommended in the HES report. This can put a significant dent in a homeowner’s yearly costs, as the average household pays almost $2,000 a year for energy, underscoring the value of efficiency upgrades.
More evaluation needed
While rating and disclosure policies have been extensively evaluated in Europe (see here), US evaluations have been much more limited. Now that Portland has 10,000 ratings, we recommend conducting an evaluation to assess how the ratings affect time on market, selling price, and home energy upgrades. Additional evaluation data will be useful for refining these programs and providing data additional cities can use to assess whether they should also require home energy disclosure.

WA and CO Join Growing State Push for Efficient Appliances;"Joint Statement by ACEEE’s Steve Nadel and ASAP’s Marianne DiMascio
Washington, DC — Washington and Colorado state legislatures adopted energy and water efficiency standards that will dramatically cut harmful carbon emissions and save consumers billions (more than $2 billion in Washington and $1 billion in Colorado), partly by pushing forward low-cost, uber-efficient light bulbs. They follow similar efforts in Vermont and California that other states are now considering. Washington Governor Jay Inslee will sign HB 1444 into law today and Colorado Governor Jared Polis is expected to sign HB19-1231 in the coming weeks.
Steve Nadel, ACEEE’s executive director said:
“Washington and Colorado are leading the way on efficiency standards. The new laws will save consumers money and water while putting a dent in the power plant emissions that contribute to climate change. We urge other governors and legislatures to join Washington, Colorado, Vermont, and California in adopting these common-sense standards. In addition, by putting the federal light bulb standards into state law, Washington and Colorado are fighting back against the Trump administration’s attempt to undo the biggest-saving standard ever. Unlike the federal government, the states are moving forward, not backward, on energy efficiency.”
Marianne DiMascio, ASAP’s state policy manager, said:
“States are discovering that appliance efficiency standards are a grand slam. They help cut heat-trapping emissions, save energy, reduce water waste, and save consumers and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars. It’s a win for any state!”
Washington and Colorado are the second and third states after Vermont to adopt this latest package of state appliance standards, many of which are based on California standards. Similar bills are pending in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island among other states. An appliance standards bill for five products also passed the Hawaii legislature last week and awaits the governor’s signature.

New In-Store Label for Window Coverings Will Give Shoppers a Clear View of Energy Savings;"In US stores this year, consumers will see a new label on window attachments such as blinds and shades that will help them find the product with the greatest energy savings for their climate.
Whether installing storm windows to ward off drafts in the winter or closing blinds and shades to keep out hot summer sun, many consumers already use window attachments to help keep their homes comfortable. Shoppers understand that window attachments can improve comfort and reduce energy bills, but until now they haven’t had the information needed to compare these products and select the most energy-efficient styles.
As the latest brief in our Emerging Opportunities in Buildings series explains today, the Attachments Energy Rating Council’s new Energy Improvement label is designed to fill that gap. Based on a product rating and certification program developed for AERC by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, the label lets consumers compare expected energy savings for window attachments in warm and cool climates. Participating manufacturers have started to label products they offer for retail sale; labeling information is also available on the AERC website and from specialty dealers and interior designers.   
The labels are already appearing in some stores. AERC and its members are working with big box home improvement stores and other retailers to educate sales staff and get their buy-in for in-store promotional materials. At this point, storm window manufacturers have been most active in labeling their products, but consumers should find labeled cellular shades and other decorative products in stores later this year.  
Extensive research and modeling went into development of the AERC rating program. These studies demonstrate that window attachments are not created equal when it comes to energy efficiency. Shades, blinds, shutters, interior and exterior storm windows, and other window attachments can improve home energy performance and comfort by reducing heating and air-conditioning energy use. Products that incorporate improved materials, components, and design can reduce heating and cooling energy use by as much as 20%.
Information from AERC’s rating and labeling program is designed to help more than just consumers. Utilities and other efficiency program administrators can use the information to design incentive programs for window attachments with the greatest potential savings in their climate.
The cumulative savings are impressive, in some places totaling hundreds of dollars per year. The map below shows estimated annual heating and cooling savings for a selection of cities across the country. A number of utilities are adding window attachments to their program portfolios. They are a popular product with lots of consumer appeal and a very large market — between 150 and 225 million window attachment products are shipped in the United States every year. These factors, combined with meaningful energy savings, make window attachments an attractive target for programs looking for new energy efficiency opportunities. 
By increasing the visibility of efficiency ratings, such labels help educate customers about decreasing their energy consumption and carbon footprints.

ACEEE Says Mahalo to Hawaii for Leadership on Energy Efficiency;"Washington, DC — Hawaii’s state legislature approved a bill (HB556) this week that would adopt minimum efficiency standards for common household products including computers, faucets, and showerheads. Governor David Ige is expected to sign the bill into law, saving Hawaiians millions of dollars on their utility bills and billions of gallons of water annually. 
Annie Gilleo, senior manager of state policy at ACEEE, said:
“This bill is huge for Hawaii. It is projected to save Hawaiians up to $38 million on their utility bills in 2025 and will reduce water consumption in the state by 1.5 billion gallons. As consumers purchase more efficient products, the year-over-year savings are projected to grow even more. By 2035, the savings are projected to reach more than $75 million and 3.2 billion gallons of water each year.”
The bill is based on standards set by the California Energy Commission (CEC), allowing Hawaii to use CEC’s database of existing, compliant products and expediting the standards’ rollout.

Energy-Efficient Building Codes Are A Cost-Effective Foundation For Rooftop Solar;"An ACEEE analysis released today finds that energy efficiency and solar make complementary energy and carbon reductions in new home construction, but when budgets are tight, efficiency needs to come first. Throughout the United States, energy efficiency is more cost effective. Each month, it delivers $4 to $32 in net savings while rooftop solar alone can cost up to $14.
With the US building stock estimated to add a net average of 1.4 million homes each year, states will need to minimize their energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by focusing on effective building codes and standards. For the US residential sector, building codes like the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) and voluntary labels like ENERGY STAR provide cost-effective guidance for insulation, windows, lighting, and heating and cooling equipment to construct efficient and sustainable homes.
Our research paper and summary show that the energy efficiency measures found in these codes and standards are more cost effective than an equivalent amount of energy generated from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. Based on these results, we conclude that new homes must first be built efficiently for maximum cost effectiveness. Solar panels can then be added to further reduce carbon emissions and help homes meet zero-energy targets.
States adopting residential building codes need to consider these results when assessing proposals to allow solar PV to be substituted for energy efficiency measures. Requirements like efficient windows and wall insulation help ensure long-term cost-effective energy savings for the homeowner. Solar panels can cost more, and may be dependent on financial arrangements. Even if a homebuilder can save upfront costs through financing options tied to government incentives, the homeowner will not necessarily save money in the long term.
The following graphic compares the monthly net costs for energy efficiency to meet the 2015 IECC code and equivalent solar PV generation, for cities in climate zones 2-6, spanning from the hot and humid South to the cold North. Net monthly efficiency cost savings are even greater for homes built to ENERGY STAR standards. These results do not include government incentives and assume a traditional mortgage rather than other financing.
Of course, cost effectiveness isn’t the only consideration when installing efficiency measures or solar panels. Both reduce heat-trapping carbon emissions and harmful air pollution. Plus, a well-insulated, efficient home loses and gains heat more slowly than a drafty one, helping to retain comfortable temperatures during emergency power outages. Similarly, when solar PV is paired with battery storage, it can provide a homeowner with electricity during a power outage.
When it comes to improved health and comfort, insulation combined with high-efficiency windows and air conditioning systems have an advantage over solar PV. They also typically reduce peak power demand, whereas solar power can reduce peak demand mid-day, but this benefit fades as the sun sets, so the grid needs to ramp up quickly to meet demand. On the other hand, installing rooftop solar panels is a great way to signal a clean energy commitment to the world, while efficiency measures like insulation and efficient water heaters typically remain hidden.
Solar energy and energy efficiency are both key parts of our energy future. For example, solar and efficiency together can help meet ambitious zero-energy building targets, like California’s Residential New Construction Zero Net Energy (ZNE) Action Plan.
When it comes to constructing a new home throughout most of the United States, our study shows that energy efficiency is the most cost-effective choice. Once a home achieves compliance with energy codes through energy efficiency, then solar can help meet the remaining energy load.

Greenercars Update: Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai Top 2019’s Greenest List;"In updated rankings published today, Greenercars.org has a new winner for 2019 — the Mercedes-Benz smart EQ fortwo Coupe. It now tops the Greenest List, beating the Hyundai Ioniq Electric by one point and joining other green vehicles with state-of-the-art technology such as automation and electric powertrains.
In addition to the smart fortwo, two other cars joined the updated Greenest List: the plug-in hybrid Prius Prime, ranking third, and its hybrid sibling the Prius Eco, ranking sixth. We released initial scores in January, but due to the federal government shutdown at the time, we were unable to score many 2019 vehicle models because they had yet to clear the Environmental Protection Agency’s certification process.  
Today, we release the scores for an additional 74 vehicles, bringing the total number of 2019 models scored to 1,331. Each vehicle receives a green score based on an environmental damage index (EDX), which reflects the cost to human health from air pollution associated with vehicle manufacturing, production and distribution of fuel or electricity, and vehicle tailpipes.
  Our Greenercars.org update includes many notable models with some form of electric powertrain, including an additional 14 battery electric vehicles, five plug-in hybrids, and five traditional hybrids. Compared to the past five model years, this is an increase of more than 40% in the number of electrified vehicle models scored, an all-time high and accounting for over 8% of models available on the market today.
In our database, you can find a list of vehicles eligible for parking benefits at LEED-certified buildings and our regional electric vehicle calculator that allows you to see how a particular EV would score if charged with your local mix of power generation plants.
Even with the large number of electrified vehicles featured here, our 2019 Market Trends report shows that the industry continues to push the envelope with advanced fuel-saving technologies such as downsized turbocharged engines. Clearly, automakers have made strides in efficiency, performance, and practicality, giving consumers cleaner options at all price points.
Many of the vehicles on the Greenest List also come standard with automated technology such as adaptive cruise control that, if implemented correctly, could save fuel and reduce emissions. However whether automation technology in general will successfully reduce fuel and emissions remains to be seen.
Greenercars will continue to evaluate how groundbreaking technology affects a vehicle’s lifecycle emissions. In the meantime, ACEEE is hosting a one-day Forum on Connected and Automated Vehicles: Energy Impacts May 6 in Washington, DC, that will feature more than a dozen speakers and four interactive sessions to discuss this very question. We invite you to participate by registering here.

Will Vehicle Automation Help or Hurt the Environment? Join Our Conversation;"Many of today’s cars are already available with connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. Testing of fully autonomous vehicles is underway in cities and states across the United States, including Arizona, Texas, and Wyoming. And 22 US states and Washington, DC, have already passed legislation to shape the rollout and impacts of these vehicles.
We will focus on energy impacts at our upcoming Forum on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, which will feature policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders such as General Motors, Toyota, and Volvo. To get a sneak peek, we spoke with one of our moderators, Wendy Tao, who heads Smart Cities for Siemens Intelligent Traffic Systems, about the opportunities — and challenges — of a CAV future.
REGISTER FOR CAV FORUM
Your team has partnered with local governments on smart city transportation solutions. Which cities are viewing CAVs as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve livability?
Many of the conversations are around safety but there are some key initiatives that are thinking of how to improve environmental objectives.  For example, in Arcadia, California, there is a Live Oak corridor where they are testing how connected vehicle information can provide advice on how to minimize stops and delay to be most efficient in traveling the corridor. Another example that we have worked on is in Newcastle in the UK (Project Compass 4D), where one of the key connected vehicle use cases included a green light speed advisory (priority green wave applications) to reduce overall delay.
The forum will bring together people with a wide range of perspectives. What’s a CAV challenge that calls for a better understanding between technology and policy experts?
One topic we have been working with is interoperability with different manufacturers. Instead of the proprietary activities of the past, manufacturers are needing to play in the same sandbox so a car can drive from Washington, DC, to Seattle and still get the benefits of the CAV technology interpreted in the right way for the motorist. There are plugfests and certifications that support this, but I believe it will continue to be a challenge since this field is changing so rapidly.
What is involved in the adoption of fully autonomous vehicles?
Two parallel tracks are happening. The first is the infrastructure side. The second is the vehicle side. From the infrastructure side, autonomous vehicles have been researched for over two decades, but only in the last two three years have we seen significant deployments. Three significant pilots were supported by the USDOT (US Department of Transportation) in NYC, Tampa, and Wyoming, and numerous smaller pilots followed across the county. At this point, many states have led the charge to significantly invest in infrastructure, including Michigan, Ohio, and Florida.
From the vehicle side, technology has improved and significant investments from big OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and venture capital see the future in AVs. Time frame will be small-scale deployments in the next few years (it’s already happening) but much wider adoption by 2030 (my opinion).
Manufacturers, users, and society at large have great expectations for autonomous vehicles. Can this technology deliver?
I’m not sure, because no one agrees what “deliver” means! Cities are seeing an increase in vehicle miles traveled, which is not exactly helping their congestion problems. But autonomous vehicles hold great promise to give mobility and accessibility to a larger set of needs (seniors who can’t drive, children being picked up and dropped off, food deliveries, the impaired driver). There are many solid use cases emerging, but we should not think of these technologies in a vacuum. These should be paired with a greater transportation system made up of high-quality transit and non-motorized first-mile/last-mile.
How will the vehicles affect the environment?
One determinant is how vehicle miles are priced and charged. Right now, most of our roadways are free, and much of the “curbspace” and “parking” that are not in the most urban areas are also free or low cost. If we do not price for the use or externalities that come with overuse, we will face more impacts to the environment through increased energy use and consumption. In addition, if we displace short trips that could be done by walking and biking and use, for examples, scooters instead, there will be a big impact on increased energy use for the travel, but also the manufacturing of these devices and their batteries.

ACEEE Debunks the Myths Behind the Ohio Bill That Would Gut Efficiency Programs;"As the Ohio state legislature holds a hearing tomorrow on a bill that would effectively gut the state’s energy efficiency programs, we want to explain why the bill's special interest supporters are flat out wrong.
House Bill 6 would establish a “Clean Air Program Fund” to support Ohio’s aging nuclear fleet while simultaneously rolling back the state’s energy efficiency and renewable energy standards. It would effectively saddle customers with the bill for expensive power plants while eliminating options to control how and when they use energy. Unfortunately, the bill is based on a faulty understanding of energy efficiency. The arguments for the bill simply don’t add up.
MYTH: The Clean Air Program would save customers money.
HB 6 adds a monthly charge to customers’ bills to fund the Clean Air Program, ranging from $2.50 for residential customers to $2,500 for large commercial and industrial customers, but it provides no direct benefits in exchange. In contrast, similarly funded energy efficiency programs save customers money by reducing energy usage and keeping utility system costs down. In 2017, every $1 spent on energy efficiency programs created $2.65 in benefits for Ohio families and businesses. These benefits don’t accrue just for program participants. Instead, energy efficiency is an important low-cost resource for all customers. It helps everyone by keeping costs down. A study by ACEEE found Ohio’s energy savings goals could save customers almost $5.6 billion in avoided energy expenditures and reduced wholesale energy and capacity prices over 10 years of implementation.
MYTH: Energy efficiency is just a tax with no benefits.
Even beyond the utility sector, energy efficiency produces benefits for Ohioans. Efficiency improvements in buildings and industry decrease fossil fuel emissions and air pollution. The reduced emissions could help counties working to improve air quality meet national standards. A recent analysis shows that efficiency is a key tool for reducing emissions for three Ohio counties in particular: Jefferson, Lorain, Butler, and Hamilton. These pollution reductions also have significant impacts on the health of Ohio residents. In fact, ACEEE research found that Ohio is one of the states that could see the biggest health impacts from energy efficiency, saving up to $1.6 billion in avoided health harms. And efficiency is a major job creator in the state, employing almost 80,000 Ohioans. It accounts for 20% of all construction jobs and 24% of all energy sector jobs. HB 6 could completely erase these health and job benefits.
MYTH: We’ve already done enough when it comes to energy efficiency.
Ohio passed legislation in 2008 establishing energy savings goals, and utilities began implementing programs to meet them the following year. Since then, Ohio’s energy efficiency programs have saved enough energy to power every home in Ohio for more than 10 months. But there’s still a lot more to do. Not only have utilities’ own potential studies identified a clear pathway to meet the state’s current savings goals, ACEEE analysis highlighted additional savings opportunities, including emerging technologies and strategies to encourage additional customer participation. Instead of throwing in the towel, utilities should be exploring these emerging technologies and expanding outreach to underserved customers.
MYTH: Customers could still opt-in to energy efficiency programs if they want them.
The legislative proposal might seem to throw a lifeline to efficiency and renewable energy programs by allowing interested customers to opt back in. However, this proposal would be impossible to implement. A lot of work goes into preparing a multiyear plan for energy efficiency programs. Utilities need to plan budgets, timelines, objectives, and a whole host of operational details. The proposed legislation, which allows customers to opt-in at will, would mean utilities will have no idea what the size and scope of any programs should be, how many customers programs would cover, or the size of available budgets. It is just not possible to design and implement an effective energy efficiency portfolio under those circumstances, so it’s far more likely the programs themselves would cease to exist.
When the Ohio House hears testimony on HB 6 tomorrow, we hope legislators will take care to separate fact from fiction and protect Ohio’s energy efficiency programs.

Energy Efficiency is Great News for Earth Day;"Washington, DC — Happy Earth Day! To celebrate, we hope you consider taking a step to save energy such as replacing an old incandescent light bulb with an energy-efficient LED or scheduling an energy audit. These simple steps add up. In fact, many people don’t realize that energy efficiency can single-handedly cut about half — half — of the carbon emissions needed to meet our climate goals. Plus, you’ll save money and, with reduced pollution, breathe easier.    
So today, we’re sharing not only an interview with Denis Hayes, the national organizer of the first Earth Day in 1970, but also a new four-part video series on how we can all Live Well with Energy Efficiency.

On-Bill Financing Gains Ground but Faces Barriers to Wider Adoption;"This is the third of a four-part series of blog posts on recent developments and trends in energy efficiency financing. Prior posts covered energy service agreements and PACE financing.
More rural cooperatives and cities are now paying for energy efficiency upgrades with on-bill financing, which adds a small, monthly line item to a customer’s utility bill as the repayment vehicle. Yet this financing has not scaled up quickly, prompting efforts in several states to break down its remaining barriers.
On-bill financing programs can bring the up-front costs of energy efficiency upgrades down to zero, particularly when paired with rebates and incentives. They help customers make comprehensive energy improvements, with immediate savings on their energy bills. Because these loans are backed by a utility’s borrowing power, they often have lower interest rates than market-rate lending options.
Recent progress
Rural cooperatives have been leaders in leveraging on-bill approaches to provide their members with guaranteed bill savings from energy efficiency improvements. Electric cooperatives in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arkansas, and Kansas have launched successful on-bill programs. In Arkansas, Ouachita Electric Cooperative reported that in the first nine months after launching its program, more than 90% of customers who were offered the option signed up. In one year, its HELP PAYS program accounted for more than $1.5 million in investment, with multifamily housing accounting for about one-third of the total.
States also see a clear need for on-bill financing programs. As part of major legislation expanding and extending energy efficiency programs in 2016, the Michigan legislature allowed for financing terms of up to 15 years, paving the way for the rollout of on-bill financing programs. To date, however, only the city of Holland’s municipal utility has launched a program. It rolled out the program as one strategy to achieve its long-term energy plan. The state convened a series of workshops in 2018 to discuss scaling on-bill financing, using Holland as a key example. In addition, Hawaii just announced a major on-bill program intended to expand the accessibility of clean energy investments for residents, small businesses, and nonprofit organizations .
Other cities have also embraced on-bill financing to expand the reach of energy efficiency programs to all residents. In 2018, Fort Collins, Colorado, won a $1 million grant from the Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge to develop an on-bill financing program targeted at the city’s renters. The EPIC program helps rental and owner-occupied property owners invest in energy-and water-efficiency improvements through a streamlined assessment-to-upgrade process. The program offers low-interest financing for up to 20 years. Fort Collins emphasized accessibility in the program design, requiring no money down, structuring loans to cover up to 100% of project costs, and developing a simple application open to both single-family homes and multifamily properties. The city is now partnering with the Colorado Energy office to develop an EPIC toolkit for other cities that want to adopt the model.
Programs have been slow to ramp up
The most recent comprehensive market study of on-bill financing, published in 2016, found that the tool was responsible for nearly $200 million in lending in 2014. However, on-bill financing was experiencing a relatively slow expansion, with the annual dollar volume for on-bill programs increasing only 4% from 2012 to 2014, compared to 44% for other utility loan programs.
On-bill financing offers an opportunity to expand the pool of customers able to make energy efficiency upgrades. Recent surveying by the Smart Energy Consumer Collaborative found that more than half of respondents expressed interest in on-bill financing if the interest rate was favorable.
So why isn’t it taking off? Only a minority of utilities offer such programs. Many utilities are not interested in using their capital, are concerned about losses, or are reluctant to enter what they see as the banking business. These programs still have a long way to go to scale up. Even successful on-bill financing programs are reaching only a small percentage of customers.
Breaking down barriers
Efforts are underway to break down barriers to on-bill financing. The NC Sustainable Energy Association (NCSEA) launched The Energy Solutions Reserve Fund (ESRF) in 2018 to help mitigate concerns that financing programs expose utilities to risk. Although default rates for on-bill programs have traditionally been quite low, on the order of 0-3%, utilities are hesitant to enter into lending agreements with customers.
Several states have established loan loss reserves for specific state-based financing programs, but ESRF is a reserve fund open to utilities of all sizes across the United States. To date, utilities in Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina have signed up for ESRF, using the reserve fund to help expand on-bill lending programs. According to NCSEA, none of these utilities have had to draw down funds from ESRF, as the average default rate for on-bill financing programs is less than 0.1 percent. NCSEA is also leveraging ESRF to spur lending programs beyond traditional energy efficiency programs, working to sign up programs that could finance investments in renewable energy.
The future
While ESRF and related programs are a good start, utilities are often still reluctant to lend to consumers, because they view such programs as beyond their core expertise. Enticing more utilities to offer on-bill financing will require additional efforts, such as new sources of capital that utilities can use, pre-packaged programs that utilities can easily adopt, and organizations with consumer finance expertise with which utilities can partner. On-bill financing has great potential, but growth is likely to remain moderate unless some of these additional barriers can be addressed.
Editor’s note: In this blog post, we discuss recent developments for a variety of on-bill program types. The rural electric cooperatives we highlight, including Ouachita Electric Cooperative, use an on-bill tariff approach, in which efficiency upgrades are financed not through a loan, but rather through a utility offer that pays for upgrades under the terms of a new, additional tariff. For more background on on-bill program types, see ourfinancing toolkit.

Earth Day Since the 70s: A Founder's Tale;"In 1970, headbands were in, Simon & Garfunkel topped the charts, and Denis Hayes, a graduate student at Harvard, read about a fledgling environmental movement. Determined to volunteer, he flew to Washington, DC, with the intention of organizing Earth Day at Harvard. Instead, he became the organizer for Earth Day across the entire United States.
Inspired by the role of teach-ins in anti-war and civil rights protests, US Senator Gaylord Nelson started the Earth Day movement as a “national teach-in on the environment.” The movement swiftly gained popularity, and today Earth Day is celebrated in more than 190 countries.
We sat down with Denis Hayes to discuss the first 49 years of Earth Day, the evolution of the movement, and how energy—and efficiency—play a huge role in climate action and a sustainable future.
 What was it like to be the national coordinator of the first Earth Day?
It was like riding a Tesla with the pedal to the floor. The acceleration was from zero to 1,000 in a matter of months. Early community meetings often had fewer than a dozen people. But April 22, we had 20 million participants, with more than one million in Manhattan alone! 
My hope—in some large measure realized—was that Americans would come to see that they had a “right” to a clean, healthy environment, and that the law would guarantee that. The first Earth Day was passionate and intense, and it led directly to a wave of change. Clean Air Act. Clean Water Act. Endangered Species Act. Marine Mammal Protection Act. EPA and NOAA. Superfund. On and on.  
What role have energy and energy efficiency played in Earth Day over the past 49 years?
Energy has been at the core of much of what Earth Day has sought to achieve over the decades. (The Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969 was one of the fuses that set off Earth Day.) By seeking to internalize the real costs of acid rain in the price of electricity and steel, through CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) regulations of automobile fuel efficiency, by promotion of LED lights and super-efficient refrigerators and high-efficiency heat pumps, etc., we’ve tried to envision a comfortable life requiring vastly less energy. We have made clear that a healthy environment does not involve living in caves and reading by candle light.  
In the Carter Administration, I headed SERI (since renamed NREL [National Renewable Energy Laboratory]), which housed the most advanced renewable energy research effort on the planet. SERI’s Assistant Director for Policy, ACEEE champion Henry Kelly, was responsible for compiling the strategy to reach President Jimmy Carter’s goal of obtaining 20% of the nation’s energy from solar by the year 2000. Although this was definitely a challenge, it was plausible only because the heart of the proposal was radical improvements to the nation’s energy efficiency.
Had we stayed on that path, we could have avoided the climate crisis comparatively cheaply and painlessly. Henry’s team included Art Rosenfeld, Bob Williams, Jeff Harris, David Goldstein, Frank von Hippel, Charles Gray, and many others who have played prominent roles at ACEEE over the years.  
How would you describe the diversity, or lack thereof, of the environmental movement since 1970?
The first Earth Day, and the environmental movement in general, has been largely powered by women. Women constitute most of the members of local, state, and national environmental groups.
Racial and ethnic diversity has historically been more iffy. On that first Earth Day, we had African-American groups protesting plans to plow freeways through their dynamic inner-city neighborhoods. But the big crowds were overwhelmingly white and middle class. If you were a poor person of color, you had a lot of other problems and not a lot of extra time. So although the poor have always suffered the worst environmental conditions, only in times of true crisis have they tended to include the environment near the top of their priorities.  
The environmental groups themselves were part of the problem. They all raised most of their money through direct mail. Poor people tended to respond to personal requests, not direct mail, so they weren’t on the mailing lists that were traded and sold. Groups tended to emphasize the issues that got the great mail response, so they wound up emphasizing issues that appealed to middle-class, college-educated white people. This is despite the fact that black and Latinx people and Asian & Pacific Islanders often respond very affirmatively to various environmental issues and are consistent sources of support for parks and other environmental ballot issues. 
This is improving. There are strong, young environmental justice and climate justice groups carving out their own space. And mainstream groups have, for a couple of decades, been diversifying their boards, their staffs, and memberships. But there remains a long way to go.  
Are recent dire reports about climate change adding an urgency to Earth Day?
It is already far too late to avoid many of the ravages of climate change—intense storms, forest fires, droughts, etc. The question today is whether we—and the entire rest of the world—can make a swift enough transition to the ultra-efficient use of 100% renewables to avoid tipping points where climate cycles produce feedback loops that are self-reinforcing, like wide-scale emissions from warming methane hydrates. That will be an enormously heavy lift; some would say it is highly improbable, if not impossible. If we are to stand a chance, the Earth Day campaign for 2020 must recapture all the intensity of those first few years.

How to Spur Home Energy Upgrades? Persuasive Assessment Reports;"In a world of 280-character tweets, people have limited attention spans. So to nudge them toward making energy efficiency upgrades, home assessment reports need to grab their attention in the first few pages, according to ACEEE research that evaluated the eye-tracking habits of potential customers.
“Customers stop reading after about four or five pages” said one assessor. Experts in graphic design, behavioral science, and energy efficiency assessment reviewed 42 sample reports with the goal of improving the reports and increasing the number of home upgrades. Almost nine million households were assessed as of 2015, but the reports can be difficult to understand or unpersuasive.
Expert comments reflected ACEEE’s findings from the eye-tracking study. Information presented first receives more attention, regardless of how interesting or important it is. Reports should begin with a personalized narrative summary along with key tables to ensure the customer can quickly make an informed decision. Interested customers can always look in the back of the report or an appendix for more details.
A report’s reading level can also have an impact. Using a web-based tool, we calculated the “readability” scores for each of 45 sample assessment reports. We found that, on average, reports were written at an 11th grade level, which is difficult for the average reader. We suggest trying to write reports closer to an 8th grade reading level, avoiding jargon and acronyms. That way, reports will not have dense language, which can pose an obstacle for homeowners when selecting energy efficiency upgrades.
Also important is how the report is presented. As one assessor noted, “any report delivered without a presentation is toilet paper.” Customers who received oral presentations of their results, in addition to written reports, were more satisfied with how the reports were delivered and more likely to follow through with assessors’ recommendations.
Content experts had other suggestions. Behavioral scientists noted the importance of social comparison – in which customers learn how their home energy use compares to that of similar homes or the average home. Others noted the value of tailoring the report to each customer and using high-quality images (with explanation) as well as a simple, consistent format.
To get all the tips and recommendations from our expert panelists, as well as more information about best practices for designing and structuring assessment reports, download After the Audit: Improving Residential Energy Efficiency Assessment Reports. Contractors and home energy assessors may want to download the tips sheet for quick reference. On April 18, 2019, ACEEE will host a webinar to explain the details of this report, featuring expert panelists. There will be opportunities to participate and ask questions of the authors and experts. Register for the webinar here.
Household energy efficiency upgrades provide a substantial return on investment. If auditors can present findings more persuasively and motivate more Americans to act, this could translate to massive energy savings across the United States.

Is Ridesharing the Key to AV Success? We Talk to an Expert;"The environmental impact of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is up in the air, but Judi Greenwald sees advantages to integrating them into fleets that provide mobility as a service.
We sat down with Greenwald, who will be moderating the policy panel at our upcoming Forum on Connected and Automated Vehicles: Energy Impacts, to discuss her new article in Energy Policy and why the future of AVs might be brighter if you can find them on a transportation app—not in your driveway. A former US Department of Energy official, she now runs Greenwald Consulting and is a visiting fellow at Princeton University’s Andlinger Center on Energy and the Environment.

Here are excerpts from our conversation:
What’s driving the development of vehicle automation?
There are two big motivations—to increase mobility access and to make our roads safer.
We have a lot of car accidents in the United States and in the world. Even though we think we’re good drivers, we’re really not. Humans make mistakes. AVs have the potential to be safer than a conventional vehicle with a human driver, but whether we can operationalize this in the real world to achieve that promise is a question.
The other motivation is mobility. There are a lot of people who don’t have access to mobility. There are also a lot of people who can’t drive, like the old, the young, and the disabled. Many of these people live far from jobs and grocery stores and doctors and things they need to get to. And so there’s potential for AVs. While AVs will probably be expensive, if we have AVs as part of fleets that provide mobility as a service then they can really increase mobility access.
What will determine the environmental impact of AVs?
On the per-vehicle emission side, the most important things are the fuel economy standards. The fuel economy standards have been our biggest public policy success in controlling fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, and people like them; they poll 70 plus percent [approval]. What we really should be doing is strengthening them, and making them work a little better for consumers and manufacturers.
The second most important thing is zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates. Requiring every vehicle to have zero emissions now would be too expensive, but having a small percentage required to be super clean drives innovation for that sector.
On the vehicle miles traveled side, the biggest thing is ride sharing. If we have AVs that are just carrying one passenger (kind of like what we have now, where most personal vehicles carry one person the majority of the time), and if you have more people being driven by AVs than can currently drive themselves, then you’d have huge increase in vehicle miles traveled.
But if people rideshare, if you have autonomous vehicles taking two people to a place where they would have driven in their own cars, then you could be okay or potentially even better off. When I was at the Department of Energy, we calculated that there could be anywhere from a 60 percent reduction in fuel use for cars and light trucks to a 200 percent increase, or triple the fuel use.
Who owns these vehicles really matters. If AVs are owned by individuals, there is likely to be more of a vehicle miles travelled increase than if they are fleet owned by a company that provides mobility as a service.
Fleet owners are also better about doing the economic calculations for the vehicle itself. A fleet operator is going to be very sensitive to fuel costs, and it is going to want more efficiency. This means [fleets] will buy more efficient vehicles, and they’ll buy more electric vehicles. Because they use their vehicles more, they’ll get a quicker payoff from fuel savings, offsetting the higher upfront costs of the vehicles themselves.
When you or I own a car, that car spends 95% of its time parked. During the 5% of the time it is in motion, it’s usually just one person in the car. But if I’m a vehicle fleet owner, I’m going to use that vehicle way more, and I’m going to fill it up much more often. This motivates me to pay more up front for fuel efficiency because I’ll make my fuel savings back more quickly. 
The Forum will bring together people with a wide range of perspectives. What’s an AV-related challenge that calls for a better understanding between technology and policy experts?
Alain Kornhauser and I wrote the [Energy Policy] article together to try and get our two respective worlds to talk to each other more. Alain Kornhauser has been involved in autonomous vehicles for decades; he’s the head of the transportation program at Princeton University engineering school. He focuses on the safety and mobility of AVs. I’m focused on energy and environmental policy.
 In the safety and mobility transportation world, everyone is deep into autonomous vehicles, but in my world, on energy and environmental policy, people are paying very little attention to AVs. I worked on the US midcentury strategy for deep decarbonization for the Obama administration, and we didn’t even consider the implication of autonomous vehicles.
Our goal is to make sure that energy and environmental policy makers understand that the impact of AVs could go either way. It could either be a really good thing or a really bad thing, and we’d better pay attention and do something about it. And hopefully it will also cause people in Alain‘s world, the transportation and safety folks, to think about the energy and environmental implications of what they’re doing.  The key message that we have for the energy and environmental policy makers is that it’s up to us, and that’s actually the name of our paper: “It’s up to us: Policies to improve climate outcomes from automated vehicles.”

Efficiency Reduces Energy Burdens for Low-Income Multifamily Households;"Energy efficiency programs save an average of more than $100 in utility bills for low-income households living in multifamily buildings, helping many of them pay their bills on time and avoid service disconnections, according to an ACEEE survey of 32 programs across the United States.
Such savings are crucial for low-income households. These residents are finding it increasingly difficult to keep their housing costs affordable. Rents across the United States are out of reach for many, and federal affordable housing programs that offer rental assistance are at risk of being cut. While homeownership can offer many low-income families the opportunity to stabilize their finances and build wealth, these households often encounter barriers to buying a home.
Financial pressures lead many low-income households to search for low-rent apartments in multifamily buildings. The most affordable apartments are often older and in need of repairs. Because these apartments are typically not as energy efficient as newer buildings, they can create high energy burdens for residents.
Reducing energy burdens
In our new report, Closing the Gap in Energy Efficiency Programs for Affordable Multifamily Housing, we document how energy efficiency programs are doing their part to reduce energy bills for residents and owners of these properties. We analyzed 32 programs from multiple regions of the United States that were actively working in 2017 to increase the energy efficiency of affordable multifamily buildings. The properties they served were home to more than 192,000 low-income households.
The average energy savings we found — equivalent to a month and a half of energy use — not only help residents pay their bills, but also help property owners preserve affordable housing. The efficiency improvements can also provide numerous health, environmental, and economic benefits.
Some programs hired local contractors to install a limited number of no-cost energy efficiency upgrades in homes. Others offered property owners incentives to make their own building improvements with efficiency measures selected from an extensive list. All the programs, regardless of their approach or climate, have the potential to achieve substantial, cost-effective energy savings. In 2017, 11 programs served at least 5,000 apartments and five programs achieved savings roughly equivalent to four or more months of energy use in the average apartment.
Key strategies for success
While effective program practices may vary by location, they share common strategies. The most important component is giving property owners and managers technical assistance throughout the retrofit project. Often, this takes the form of a one-stop shop model that streamlines multiple program services through a single point of contact for owners and managers. For example, Energy Outreach Colorado administers Xcel Energy’s Affordable Housing Rebate Program, which provides a one-stop shop that helps participants with performing energy audits, hiring high-quality contractors, and obtaining financing.
Effective programs also depend on strong partnerships across multiple industries.  The District of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility’s Low-Income Multifamily Custom Program helps participants connect with private lenders. Georgia Power’s Home Energy Improvement Program has spent years cultivating relationships with high-quality local contractors. National Grid - Rhode Island’s income-eligible multifamily program has partnered with many affordable housing organizations and government agencies to build awareness of its offers and requirements.
These energy efficiency programs are providing real household savings and playing an important role in keeping housing costs affordable for low-income households. By implementing best practices from effective, high-performing programs, administrators can expand their reach and impact to maximize savings for low-income households and property owners alike.

Puerto Rico Sets Ambitious New Energy Efficiency Targets;"Puerto Rico’s Governor Ricardo Rosselló is expected to soon sign legislation that sets ambitious energy-saving targets, joining a number of states that are pushing energy efficiency alongside renewables in response to climate change and resilience challenges.
This new legislation sets the territory on a path to save 30% of electricity by 2040 and to meet 100% of its supply with renewable energy by 2050. It also supports other building blocks for energy efficiency, including a lead-by-example requirement in government buildings, efficiency’s inclusion in future utility system planning, and performance-based regulation that aligns utility incentives with expansion of efficiency and other clean resources.
When implemented, this legislation will represent a massive step forward for the territory, where energy efficiency programs have lagged behind other parts of the United States, and where renewables represented only 2% of the territory’s electricity supply in Fiscal Year 2017. As of the 2017 ACEEE State Scorecard, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the territory’s utility, did not offer meaningful efficiency programs to its customers, and it lacked regulatory mechanisms to incentivize efficiency investments.
Source: 2017 ACEEE State Scorecard

Puerto Rico is heavily dependent on expensive oil for more than three-quarters of its energy needs, and its vulnerable transmission and distribution system forces reliance on expensive diesel generators after storms. These factors have led to high electricity rates, without the efficiency programs needed to mitigate the impact on customer bills. Hawaii grapples with even higher energy prices, but is already successfully implementing a similar energy efficiency standard, aiming to use efficiency to meet 30% of energy needs in 2030.
After Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused devastating damage to Puerto Rico’s electrical grid in 2017, a bipartisan group of legislators came together to articulate a new vision for the territory’s energy system. That vision focused on a pathway towards a self-sufficient, clean, distributed energy future, supported by energy efficiency and strong integrated resource planning. The legislators also recommended adoption of a modern performance-based regulatory framework that encourages efficiency for all energy sector participants. The pending legislation largely adopts the collaborative’s vision, setting up a robust framework for transforming the territory’s energy system.
But setting a goal is not enough — the next step is implementation. The legislation requires that the regulator, the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau (PREB), issue a regulation within 180 days that   establishes the mechanisms for meeting the territory’s energy efficiency goal. The bill also enhances PREB’s ability to set and enforce these regulations. PREB is already exercising that authority in service of clean energy and resilience. A few weeks ago, the regulator rejected a PREPA integrated resource plan that conflicted with the policies in this new legislation, requiring the utility to resubmit a new, more robust plan.
As the regulator seeks to measure and meet these standards, it faces some of the same questions encountered by the 27 states across the United States with an EERS. Last year, New Jersey and Virginia added new energy efficiency savings and spending targets respectively, while Arkansas and New York expanded their existing targets. Each of these states is now in the process of implementing those regulations, with program administrators proposing plans for meeting new targets. New Jersey is considering similar questions about how to best administer its energy efficiency programs after the legislature set ambitious savings targets for electricity and natural gas. ACEEE and other experts and stakeholders submitted comments highlighting best practices.
With a renewed commitment to energy efficiency, the promise of a new energy future is on the horizon in Puerto Rico. Under the new legislation, it is slated to join New York, New Jersey, Arkansas, and others in implementing new or expanded energy efficiency targets in coming months. These upgrades are projected to make Puerto Rico’s grid more sustainable and resilient so the territory will be better prepared for the future.

Pennsylvania Weighs Legislation That Could Deliver +30k Jobs;"Pending bipartisan legislation in Pennsylvania could unlock 30,000 jobs and about $6.4 billion in net savings by removing barriers to energy efficiency investment, according to ACEEE analysis released today.
The House and Senate bills would remove the caps on efficiency spending included in Act 129, which Pennsylvania lawmakers passed in 2008 to set savings targets for electric utilities. Those targets delivered significant energy savings to businesses and residents. But because of the spending caps, the savings remain below the potential levels identified by statewide evaluators, and below savings achieved in neighboring Maryland, Ohio, and New York.
ACEEE, building on prior research by Synapse Energy Economics, Inc., assessed the economic impacts of removing the investment cap, which Senate Bill 232 and House Bill 193 — if passed — would do. We compared the impacts of slowly ramping up electricity savings over five years beginning in 2021 to a base scenario in which utilities continue to implement efficiency programs at current spending-constrained levels.
Each scenario saves energy and creates jobs, but the economic impacts of ramping up electricity savings to 1.2% are significantly better. Ramping up energy savings from 2021 to 2025 leads to 30,000 jobs, about 50% more jobs than would be created if energy savings stay flat. As the graph below shows, these job impacts don’t occur just in five years of program implementation. Instead, new jobs are projected to continue growing as long as efficiency measures are delivering savings (through 2050).
ACEEE’s study looked only at the job-creation impacts of five years of program implementation. However, it’s likely that Pennsylvania utilities will continue to deliver these popular energy efficiency programs to customers well after 2025. As programs continue to achieve energy savings, we expect job growth to continue to grow, as well.
Pennsylvania’s Senate Bill 232 and House Bill 193 enjoy support from Democrats and Republicans, as well as more than two dozen business groups. If passed, they would give electric utilities the green light to ramp up energy efficiency programs. The result? More energy savings for consumers and at least 30,000 jobs across the Commonwealth.

Toyota Loses Ground on Fuel Economy as Federal Agencies Seek Rollback of Vehicle Standards;"Toyota, an industry leader in hybrid technology for two decades, is the only major automaker to lose ground on fuel economy in recent years. And with the Trump administration poised to roll back fuel efficiency standards, Toyota may face less pressure to pick up its pace.
Toyota previously posted one of the industry’s best miles per gallon (mpg) averages for its fleet. It benefitted from selling more than 10 million hybrids worldwide since launching its signature Prius in 1997. Today’s most fuel-efficient Prius gets a whopping 56 mpg.  
Still, with robust truck sales, Toyota’s fleet mpg actually decreased from 2012-2017, according to the US Protection Agency’s (EPA) new Automotive Trends Report. In contrast, prodded by stricter US fuel economy standards for 2012-2016 vehicles, the other 12 foreign and domestic manufacturers increased their fleet mpg averages during the same five-year period.
The result: Cuts in carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change and the resulting harm to human health.

The administration’s proposal to roll back Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards could slow the industry’s overall progress and allow Toyota’s technological foot-dragging to continue. The administration is expected to announce a final rule as early as May.
The EPA report says Toyota lags behind other manufacturers in adopting fuel efficiency technologies such as direct injection, turbocharging, and cylinder deactivation.
Toyota’s Tundra, its only full-size pickup, is emblematic of the company’s failure to keep pace. Since 2011, Tundra has gained no efficiency technologies. As a result, its 8-cylinder four-wheel drive model has remained a fuel-thirsty 18.7 mpg, even as this vehicle’s CAFE target rose to 25.1 mpg for model year 2017.
The Tundra also lags behind Detroit Three pickups—Dodge Ram, Ford F-150, and Chevy Silverado. The all-new 5.7L Dodge Ram pickup has improved its fuel economy by 4 mpg by incorporating mild hybrid technology and 2 mpg by using cutting-edge technologies like active aerodynamics. Ford has improved the F-150’s fuel economy, on average, by 2 mpg by reducing curb weight by 700 pounds, which customers have welcomed.
One of Toyota’s best options may be to embrace hybridization for the Tundra, as it did for passenger cars at the beginning of the new millennium. A full hybrid system could improve the 5.7L V8 Tundra’s fuel economy to more than 25 mpg in real-world driving. This would surpass the Tundra’s 2025 fuel economy target without compromising drivability, horsepower, or torque and may allow Toyota to add new features valued by pickup buyers, like electrical outlets that could power a contractor’s power tools on the job site.
A hybrid Tundra would also allow Toyota to bypass a host of other powertrain improvements, potentially avoiding some costs and complexity of adding multiple technologies. Combining a relatively simple hybrid powertrain with modern vehicle design could help satisfy the Tundra’s customer base while meeting fuel economy requirements for years to come.
Yet if the Trump administration succeeds in rolling back fuel economy standards, Toyota and other manufacturers will have fewer incentives to push for higher-mpg fleets. Consumers will pay the price, refilling their cars more often and breathing dirtier air.

Vehicle Automation Is Cool But Will It Save Energy? We Talk to an Expert;"We’re in a new era of rapid advances in vehicle technologies. Safety, mobility, and convenience benefits are spurring the development, for example, of connected and autonomous vehicles or CAVs. Sure, the cars of the future sound cool, but what will they mean for our energy use, infrastructure, and transportation policy?
REGISTER NOW for early bird discount
To answer this question, ACEEE is holding its first CAV forum —a day-long event in Washington, DC, on the energy impacts of vehicle automation. We caught up with one of the speakers, Carla Bailo, president and CEO of the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that provides research to help manufacturers and municipalities plan for the future. We asked her about the opportunities and challenges of widespread CAV adoption. Here are excerpts of our conversation:
How might vehicle connectivity affect fuel efficiency, whether directly or indirectly?
There will be a direct effect. When the vehicles can communicate with infrastructure to find out where traffic jams are and how to avoid them, they don’t idle in traffic. When they communicate with smart traffic signals, they can learn how long the light will be and essentially tell a driver, ‘you’re not going to make that green light, you might as well just take your foot off the gas now and just coast.’ That will help a lot. 
When vehicles communicate among each other, they can decrease following distance and lane width, which should enable a greater throughput. This means fewer bottlenecks, less idling time, and a shorter commute, which is both more efficient and better for the environment. Of course, fuel economy, CO2, and GHG emissions are pieces of this too—and when it all goes together you begin to see some remarkable changes that will add up.
Let’s talk timing—how long until we see fully autonomous vehicles?
That’s a loaded question! We will see “level four” vehicles by the early 2020s. Level four vehicles have the technology to drive themselves, but are in a geo-fenced area, which is an area or very specific route that only autonomous vehicles are allowed to drive in. This reduces interaction with others on open roadways.
I don’t think we’re going to see fully autonomous vehicles out on the open roadways until 2040 for a number of reasons. One is technology. The average vehicle on the road is 12 years old and does not communicate; it’s going to take a long time to get those cars off the roadways. When you start mixing autonomous vehicles with human driven vehicles there are so many different aspects to machine learning and artificial intelligence, and it’s going to take a while to crack that ‘technology nut,’ so to speak.
Another reason is some of the things that many companies have already experienced in their pilots with regard to public policy, insurance, liability, consumer trust, and behavior changes. These are tough hurdles to overcome. Technology can move at a great pace, but all of those other aspects have to follow suit to make an environment that’s right for autonomous vehicles.
What will determine how CAVs affect the environment and overall energy consumption?
That really depends how we deploy them. Right now CAVs are relatively expensive, but when the technology reaches a stage where people are able to simply replace their current car with an autonomous car we could have a complete mess. We will have cars not only driving people but also going out and doing errands for people, so it will completely bottleneck many areas. To deploy it properly we really have to look at human behavior, and changing human behavior. That involves going from the personal ownership model to a shared ownership model and providing the right incentives to drive those changes in human behavior.
Will these technologies meet the expectations of manufacturers, users, and society at large?
We hope so! It depends on what you’re looking for. When I think about autonomous vehicles I immediately think of safety and throughput (road capacity). I also think of people who either have never had independence or have lost their independence, such the disabled or the elderly. While they may not be able to drive a vehicle, we still need to provide them with opportunities for mobility. Providing opportunities for mobility to underserved populations can improve their access to things like healthcare, education, transportation to and from work, and other opportunities. I really think this is what we need to focus on when we talk about autonomous, and maybe we shouldn’t focus so much on the convenience and the ability to multitask.
The CAV forum will bring together people with a wide range of perspectives. What’s a CAV-related challenge that calls for a better understanding between technology and policy experts?
We need to find the right environment to allow different pilot tests to happen. We need to be able to improve technology by working together with public policymakers and law enforcement so we can find solutions, and not just ways to say no. While certain communities are beginning to do this, the first thing many people hear when they want to deploy an AV is, ‘we can’t do that—the laws aren’t right and the risks are high.’ We need to find common ground that balances the learning with the risk. It reminds me of the first automobiles in the era of horses; they went through the same discussion about the issues related to safety and technology—and fearfulness of the technology—but look how quickly that was overcome with the right mindset.

From Construction to Retrofits, PACE Financing Is Saving Serious Energy;"Property assessed clean energy (PACE), a popular, long-term financing tool for energy and water conservation projects, has grown quickly in recent years across the United States.
The PACE market increased by 75% from 2016 to 2017, completing $251 million in funding by the end of 2017, according to PACENation, a private advocacy group. The impact is significant. Commercial PACE funding has cumulatively saved 6.3 billion kWh, which equals the electricity used by about 25,000 commercial office buildings each year.
PACE financing, used for energy efficiency and clean energy projects, is repaid as an assessment on a property’s tax bill. This financing mechanism means the loan stays with the property rather than the customer, even if the property is sold. To date, 36 states and the District of Columbia have passed PACE-enabling legislation, the first step in giving customers access to this financing tool. Local governments in these states then establish programs, which may be run by third parties.
Commercial PACE, or C-PACE, has been driven by expansion into new markets. In Milwaukee in 2016, PACE Equity financed $7 million of a new Marriott hotel, the first new construction project to use PACE financing in its capital stack. PACE financing accounted for 10% of the project’s development costs, including improvements to HVAC, water heating, windows, and controls. These upgrades resulted in 42% energy savings over code. PACE Equity has also applied C-PACE to new construction projects in other states, including Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky, and Missouri. According to PACENation, PACE financing can currently be applied to new commercial construction projects in 11 states.
Multifamily upgrades
PACE providers have also begun to finance efficiency upgrades in multifamily housing. Lean and Green Michigan, the statewide PACE administrator, has developed several of these projects. In 2018, it worked with Hannon Armstrong and Counterpointe SRE to develop a PACE project that will turn a pair of brick buildings near the state capitol into a mixed use space, including six multifamily units. The project’s capital stack includes PACE financing, brownfield funding, traditional bank financing, and historic tax credits.
Still, these types of projects are not easy. A 2018 report found that C-PACE uptake was limited for multifamily properties because of the complexity of the financing deals, access to other (possibly more favorable) financing options, limited technical support, and competing priorities within project scopes. Nonetheless, PACE seems to be gaining traction in this space and there is significant opportunity, especially when it comes to financing upgrades for affordable multifamily buildings.
Building resiliency
Several states (e.g., Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, and Utah) have begun to focus on PACE as a tool to address building resiliency. These projects emphasize comprehensive upgrades that include building envelope improvements and energy efficiency measures paired with distributed energy, storage, and non-energy measures targeted at flood mitigation and wind resistance.
In 2016, Hannon Armstrong and Counterpointe SRE provided $500,000 in PACE financing for Southern Oaks Rehab and Nursing Center in Pensacola, Florida for a project to improve the center’s resiliency and energy efficiency. The project included a full retrofit of the building’s roof and windows, helping maintain building temperatures longer and reducing the demand on cooling units. 2017 saw the largest PACE financing project to date, a $40 million collaborative investment from CleanFund Commercial PACE Capital and PETROS PACE Finance to fund a seismic retrofit of a hospital in California. Legislation to add resiliency to PACE is now pending in Virginia and Washington.
Residential challenges
Unlike the commercial sector, the residential space still has important details to iron out. R-PACE has gained a major foothold in California, Florida, and Missouri, with more than $5 billion in financing across 220,000 home upgrades. But some policymakers are concerned that there are inadequate consumer protections in place to defend homeowners from predatory lending. California passed legislation in 2017 meant to address these concerns by placing residential PACE administrators under the regulatory oversight of a state agency, establishing licensing requirements for contractors, and adopting new underwriting guidelines that emphasize ability-to-pay standards.
Earlier this month, a federal agency took action. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking soliciting information on R-PACE to explore whether the Truth-in-Lending Act and other consumer protection provisions could be applied to PACE financing.
PACE has ramped up quickly over the past several years, accounting for almost $6 billion in project financing. Although commercial PACE is thriving, there are still steps to be taken to ensure that homeowners are adequately protected against predatory lending before residential PACE financing will be adopted more widely. Overall, PACE is a powerful mechanism for financing sustainable, energy efficient projects and reducing electricity consumption on a large scale.

Trump 2020 Budget Would Jeopardize Jobs & Clean Energy;"WASHINGTON, DC —The Trump administration’s 2020 budget request, released today, proposes a drastic, 86% cut in new funding for the Department of Energy’s office that handles popular and cost-saving energy efficiency programs. It would also seek to fund the popular ENERGY STAR® program entirely from user fees.
“This proposal, if enacted, would cause Americans’ energy costs to rise, while killing jobs around the country,” said Steve Nadel, ACEEE executive director. “Energy efficiency directly supports 2.3 million US jobs and indirectly, many more. In addition to putting these jobs at risk, these cuts run counter to the administration’s own goals of promoting economic growth and reducing wasteful spending. We hope Congress will stand up for business owners, workers, and consumers by blocking the proposed 2020 budget cuts.”
The administration proposes $343 million in new funding for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy — an 86% cut from the prior year’s actual funding of $2.4 billion. The office runs many programs that could be severely impacted; as usual, it would carry over additional funding from previous years.
While the Department of Energy has not yet released detailed numbers, the Environmental Protection Agency would eliminate the SmartWay program, Combined Heat and Power Partnership, and other voluntary programs, as well as seek to make ENERGY STAR self-funding and cut funding for its vehicle emissions program.
ACEEE’s Federal Energy Efficiency Program Fact Sheet estimates the impacts of 7 programs:
The Department of Energy (DOE) appliance standards program sets minimum efficiency levels for about 60 consumer and commercial products. It already saves the average family almost $500 each year in energy and water bills.
The Environmental Protection Agency vehicle emissions program sets emissions requirements and fuel economy labels for cars and trucks. If allowed to take effect, the 2017–2025 standards will help Americans save $370 billion through 2030.
The DOE Building Energy Codes Program helps states and local governments develop and implement energy codes for homes and commercial buildings. It saves the average family with a new home $260 in energy bills each year.
The ENERGY STAR program labels efficient products and runs efficiency programs for homes, commercial buildings, and industry. It saves as much electricity as 30 million homes use in a year.
DOE Industrial Assessment Centers train college students to help small and medium-sized manufacturing plants save energy. They have assisted more than 18,000 plants.
The DOE State Energy Program helps state governments advance energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy security. Additional investments could save as much as $7 billion through 2040.
The DOE Weatherization Assistance Program (with added funding from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program) makes energy efficiency improvements to the homes of low-income families. It saves families an average of $4,200 in lifetime utility bills.

Jobs, Jobs, Jobs: New Toolkit Helps Quantify Efficiency’s Benefits;"As new studies show energy efficiency is supporting more jobs and attracting more investments, ACEEE today releases a toolkit to help states quantify all the economic benefits of energy-saving programs. Policymakers are increasingly interested in accounting for these benefits but have often found it difficult to do so.
State regulators know efficiency is a big economic driver. US energy efficiency efforts directly support 2.35 million jobs and indirectly, many more, according to an annual report released last week by the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) and the Energy Futures Initiative (EFI). What’s more, manufacturers of fuel-efficient vehicle parts employ another half million Americans.
Energy efficiency policies can spur such jobs. In Florida alone, for example, our research released last month found the state could add as many as 135,000 by adopting five key policies.

In addition, energy efficiency is also spurring investments around the country. It drew a 2.6% annual increase in utility investments from 2014 to 2017, according to ACEEE’s annual State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. Looking forward, Navigant Research estimates these investments will grow at a compound annual rate of 4.6% in the US and Canada over the next decade. Such investments can generate substantial economic development.
Quantifying efficiency’s economic impacts, however, can often be a challenge. That’s where ACEEE’s new State Policy Toolkit comes in. It covers a variety of methodologies for accounting for the economic impacts of efficiency programs as well as potential pitfalls including double-counting benefits, incorrectly assigning expenditures when designing economic models, or even undercounting costs. By looking at program assessments and proven methodologies, state regulators will have a more complete picture of the benefits of these programs and be able to make more judicious decisions.

Florida could add 135,000 jobs by embracing five energy policies;"New ACEEE research shows that Florida could bolster energy efficiency policies to gain 135,000 jobs, making the state’s economy a bit sunnier.
In 2017, Florida ranked fourth in the nation for efficiency jobs. But with so many untapped energy efficiency opportunities, the state could gain thousands of additional jobs. That’s because efficiency creates local jobs both directly — by employing workers to perform energy audits, manufacture efficient equipment, and install efficient appliances — and indirectly, by generating bill savings that help grow the economy.
How to make these jobs a reality? Here are five key steps.
Set stronger energy savings goals for Florida utilities. In ACEEE’s most recent State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, the Sunshine State ranked 36th for spending on utility sector electric efficiency programs. Ramping up energy savings to 1% per year, following a pathway already proven by states like Arkansas, would deliver more than 100,000 jobs.
Adopt state-level appliance standards. California leads the way in raising and adopting state-level appliance standards that help move the least efficient products out of the marketplace, but states like Arizona, Texas, Georgia, and Vermont have also put standards in place. Florida has a history of setting its own standards, joining with other states in the 1970s and 1980s in setting standards for refrigerators and air conditioners, but there are many more recent standards that Florida has yet to adopt.
Promote the use of combined heat and power (CHP). Several CHP policies can help bring more than 240MW of CHP online by 2030. Such policies would clarify eligibility in interconnection standards, set production goals, offer deployment incentives, work with utilities to include CHP in their portfolios, and encourage CHP as a resilience strategy in critical facilities. This efficient technology delivers jobs and energy savings, while also providing assurance that critical facilities including hospitals, nursing homes, and places of refuge can continue to operate in emergency situations.
Update building energy codes. Florida has a track record of maintaining up-to-date building energy codes. The state can drive energy savings and associated jobs by committing to regular updates, ensuring energy saving requirements are at least as strong as national model codes, and working with localities to ensure code compliance. There are other benefits, too. Improved building envelopes can increase energy efficiency and make homes and buildings more comfortable than inefficient buildings by maintaining temperatures during power outages.
Work with major cities to benchmark large buildings. Benchmarking energy use can help building owners and operators identify opportunities for efficiency improvements and prioritize investments. Studies have found that benchmarking programs can drive savings of up to 14%. Florida already benchmarks state-owned buildings. The city of Orlando leads the way, benchmarking municipal buildings and large, privately owned commercial buildings. By working to help other large cities adopt similar policies, the state can spur efficiency investments.
Of course, investments in efficiency do more than create jobs. They also contribute to improved health, cleaner air, and increased resilience.
Florida has a significant opportunity to grow the local workforce while delivering energy and energy bill savings to the state’s residents and businesses. But without policy action, Florida may miss out on thousands of new energy jobs.
Will 2019 be the year the Sunshine State warms up to energy efficiency?

The gift that keeps giving: energy efficiency produces value year after year;"An increasing number of states are finding new ways to track and value energy savings over time, according to research published today. Energy efficiency savings can accrue over many years, but most policies focus only on the first year. Our report, Energy Efficiency Over Time: Measuring and Valuing Lifetime Energy Savings in Policy and Planning, explores recent state efforts to take a longer view and the challenges they face when policies track only short-term savings.
Energy efficiency offers a family tree of options for customers, from the “grandparents” – investments in efficient new construction that can last more than 40 years – to more youthful air conditioning filter replacements that last just a few months. Because of this range in lifetimes, energy efficiency can provide varying values in resource planning, climate policy, and investment decisions.
Typical lifetimes of savings from various measures installed or implemented in 2020.
So far, policies have generally focused on first-year savings, because this approach makes it easier to describe, measure, and plan programs. These policies may unintentionally favor measures with high first-year savings, some of which may not continue to deliver savings over a long time. However, a focus on first-year savings does not easily translate to resource planning and climate investment, settings where long-term impacts are important. The right mix of first-year and lifetime policies in cost-effectiveness testing, goals, incentives, and resource planning may vary from state to state based on other policy priorities like equity and bill impacts.
States are starting to experiment with new ways to value savings over time, and evaluators are providing better estimates of such savings. We see this emerging in two main areas: designing program administrator incentives and goal setting.
Setting Goals
State Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS), bedrock policies for saving energy, are evolving in jurisdictions around North America. Below we illustrate a few of the emerging approaches for tracking savings over time.  
Some states, including Illinois, value all the savings in a given year, plus remaining savings from measures installed in prior years. Other areas, including the Canadian province of Ontario, project savings forward. Additional strategies include setting minimum lifetime goals for a whole portfolio, accounting for savings within a given program cycle, or adjusting cost-effectiveness testing to better value energy efficiency and energy savings over time.
While these policies have transaction and tracking costs, early evidence shows that lifetime-oriented EERS better align with resource planning and encourage a longer-term perspective for energy efficiency investment.  
Business Model Incentives
Twenty-nine states have performance incentives to encourage utilities to invest in energy efficiency for their customers. Michigan and Illinois have recently begun to structure incentives that explicitly encourage investment in longer-term measures by tying eligibility or awards to savings over time. These changes draw stakeholder attention to the lifetime of efficiency. However, explicit lifetime incentives are rare, and most states encourage first-year savings, or support lifetime savings only implicitly through incentive award calculations based on the net present value of benefits (which takes into account the time-value of those benefits).
Measuring Savings
To understand and track the value of energy efficiency over time, decision makers need good estimates of how long measures and programs last. For some measures, savings decline over time if they’re not maintained well; for others, savings may grow over time when paired with strong energy-management strategies. But studies of these factors are uncommon, both because they’re less important for first-year goals and because they can be expensive. However, researchers in Ontario, Illinois, and California are gathering data to improve lifetime estimates and devising new ways to prioritize evaluation research.
Our paper finds that new measurement and policy options help encourage the whole family tree of energy efficiency options, from youthful operational and behavioral programs to LED teenagers to elderly building envelope measures. We’re eager to see states and utilities maximize use of energy efficiency over time by continuing to better align their energy efficiency policies with their planning and climate objectives.

Energy Service Agreements: Potential Big Kid in Town?;"This is the first of a four-part series of blog posts on recent developments and trends in energy efficiency finance. Subsequent posts will discuss PACE financing and on-bill financing and financing deep retrofits.
Energy service agreements (ESAs), a type of financing, are growing in popularity. Under an ESA, a service provider delivers energy-saving services using equipment it owns and operates. Recent projects include multimillion dollar investments by financial institutions (Citi and Generate Capital) and a large utility (National Grid). While most ESAs target large businesses and institutions such as hospitals and universities, at least one vendor now provides these services to homeowners.
ESAs, available for many years, have gained notable support in the past year because they provide services guaranteed to save energy in a way that is designed to be off company balance sheets at a cost that is less than or equal to existing utility charges. Many companies want to minimize the liabilities shown on their balance sheets and therefore often prefer off-balance-sheet financing. In contrast, some other financing strategies – such as power purchase agreements and operating leases (including many energy savings performance contracts and shared savings agreements) – that previously were off the balance sheet now need to be disclosed on company financial statements under new guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
Under a typical agreement, the ESA provider develops, finances, and operates projects, with the customer paying for these services through a services charge based on realized savings. The ESA provider often subcontracts engineering and installation to an energy service company that can implement complex projects and guarantee savings. In some cases, the ESA provider pays a facility’s energy bill and in turn bills the customer for the combination of energy and energy efficiency services (this variation is sometimes called a “managed energy services agreement” or MESA).
An ESA can also be used to finance and install distributed energy equipment (e.g., solar or combined heat and power) or water efficiency (commonly labeled “efficiency service agreements”). Sometimes the terms “efficiency as a service” or “energy as a service” (EaaS) are used instead, as highlighted in a recent ACEEE technology brief. A 2017 Navigant Consulting research report estimates the annual global market deployment potential of EaaS in large Fortune 500 commercial and industrial sector buildings will reach $221 billion by 2026.
ESAs are beginning to scale
In the past few years, a growing number of ESA projects have been implemented. For example, Metrus Energy, with financing from Citi, has signed six agreements, totaling $62 million, with a large technology company in the Fortune 100 (the company name is not public). The projects mostly involve installation of LED lighting at company sites around the country. Metrus is the sponsor and equity provider, with debt financing from Citi and design and installation by SmartWatt. This program includes some leased properties (where landlord consent is needed) and blending of site economics. It combines economically strong sites with economically weaker ones to provide an adequate return on the entire package.
Metrus also recently signed an agreement with National Grid to work together to identify $50 million of energy efficiency projects within National Grid’s New York State service territory, and it has other ESA projects involving a variety of energy and water efficiency measures. Its ESAs for large commercial entities have terms typically ranging from 5 to 15 years. Metrus has projects in 21 states that it estimates will cumulatively save more than a billion kWh.
Other companies are also offering ESAs. For example, Carbon Lighthouse focuses on large commercial buildings that are typically at least 200,000 square feet, particularly offices, hotels, and conference centers. It also sometimes works in buildings as small as 50,000 square feet. Through a process it calls “efficiency production,” Carbon Lighthouse sources original data via dozens of sensors placed throughout the building, supplemented by utility, weather, and other existing information to identify the scattered and hidden inefficiencies that add up to significant savings — typically 10-30% of building energy spending (15-20% savings are most common). Its retrofit packages are often built around a building management system but include lighting upgrades, equipment replacement, and when possible, solar systems.
Every Carbon Lighthouse project is underwritten by Hartford Steam Boiler, a global company offering equipment insurance, and can be financed through a Generate Capital project fund. Carbon Lighthouse guarantees the energy savings and cuts a check to the customer if savings fall short. For buildings where tenants pay for utilities, it works with the building owner to recoup costs through common area maintenance charges. The company has worked in more than 600 buildings across the United States to date and has been particularly active in California, Hawaii, and the Northeast.
Several other companies are offering ESAs to commercial customers, including Redaptive, Spark Fund, and Empower Equity.
ESAs are also going residential
One company, Sealed, is now offering ESAs for single-family homes under its HomeAdvance financing program. It offers energy efficiency retrofit packages as well as oil-to-gas heating system conversions, financed with an ESA. Sealed reaches customers through a variety of channels, but is increasingly focused on co-branded marketing partnerships with utility companies such as Con Edison in the New York City area. Customers are qualified via a virtual process, including the development of a non-binding proposal. After a customer is qualified and verbally commits to move forward, Sealed works with local contractor partners who conduct a home assessment, finalize a contract, and install the improvement packages. Common efficiency measures installed include air-sealing, insulation, and smart thermostats.
Sealed estimates that, on average, these packages reduce electricity use by about 5% and heating fuel use by about 20-25%. The typical energy efficiency package costs $6,000-7,000. The company finances the installation with a 20-year service agreement, pays the utility bill, and then collects monthly service fees from the homeowner based on actual energy reductions such that customers’ energy bills are similar to prior energy bills. As of the end of 2018, Sealed had signed agreements with about 300 customers, 200 of whom signed on last year.
So far Sealed’s service is offered in New York State, because initial financing comes from NY Green Bank. Sealed is exploring financing that can be used in other states.
Lessons to date
ESAs provide one route for customers to finance substantial efficiency retrofits and make it easy to implement energy-saving improvements; customers just need to say yes and pay service fees that are based on savings. However the sales cycle and contracts are complex and as a result, most ESAs to date are for either large owner-occupied buildings or multiple smaller buildings owned or rented by large companies.
The examples above involve standardized types of measures (lighting, commercial building “retrocommissioning,” and residential weatherization packages) that can be expected to result in a medium level of savings (roughly 10-25%). These standardized packages are offered to well-understood customer segments, helping to keep costs in check and making marketing easier. Thus far ESAs have not been used for deep retrofits that save 30% or more. However we talked to one company that aims to break this barrier by combining ESA financing with utility incentives, allowing the execution of larger projects and correspondingly larger savings.
With an ESA, the service provider incurs substantial upfront costs and takes both credit and performance risk; these costs are passed on to customers over the life of the contract. For example, the payments under a Sealed 20-year contract average roughly double the initial cost of the work, with the difference between upfront investment and lifetime payments primarily covering financing costs (including risk allowances), but also marketing and administrative costs .
Not all customers will want to commit to 10- or 20-year contracts and not all will meet program requirements. For example, Sealed requires a FICO credit score of at least 680 and residence in the home for at least six months to provide an energy-use history. And because of the risks involved, the cost of capital tends to be higher than municipal and other low-interest debt. As a result, ESAs are uncommon in the municipal market and other markets with a low cost of capital.
In the past year, ESAs have gained significant momentum. Time will tell whether they continue to grow and potentially become a big kid in town.

Roses Are Red, But They Might Not Be Green;"The energy cost of roses isn’t very romantic. Of the 250 million roses Americans buy on Valentine’s Day, 90% are imported, requiring refrigeration and hundreds of cargo planes. Even domestically grown flowers require temperature control and land transportation. Curious about the energy involved in your bouquet? Here are a few things you might not know—and a few suggestions for a more eco-friendly Valentine’s Day.
Every February, Americans shell out big bucks in the name of romance. In 2019, the National Retail Federation estimates that Americans will spend a record $20.7 billion on Valentine’s gifts, a 6% increase from last year. One-third of romantics plan to give flowers, two-thirds of which will be roses, the top choice. But most won’t come from the United States.
In recent decades, the South American flower trade has boomed. As bulk flower imports became cheap and plentiful, supermarkets and large corporations such as Walmart began to edge out local florists as America’s primary flower vendors. As a result, the domestic flower market shrunk. In 2015, the United States was the world’s largest importer of cut flowers, importing about 70% of all flowers sold in the US with the number spiking to 90% for Valentine’s roses, according to the Society of American Florists.    
Where do they come from?
Of imported US flowers, almost all come from Colombia, Ecuador, and the European Union. Terril Nell, a professor emeritus at the University of Florida who specializes in the production and postharvest care of domestic and international flower crops, explained that the varied altitude and temperatures of equatorial nations provide optimal growing conditions for different types of flowers. These flowers often do not require additional heating or cooling until they are transported. In European nations, flowers are often cultivated in temperature-controlled greenhouses.
After being cut, they are refrigerated at a maximum of 40 degrees Fahrenheit, packed into a cargo plane with more than one million other blossoms, and shipped stateside. Every day for three weeks leading up to Valentine’s Day, 30 cargo planes laden with roses will travel from Colombia to Miami.
Energy estimates
The four billion flowers imported from Colombia each year consume 114 million liters of fuel and release 360,000 metric tons of CO2 on their flights to Miami alone, according to Brandon Graver of the International Council on Clean Transportation. But what about the 250 million Valentine’s Day roses? Assuming 90% are imported, then shipping romance overseas takes about 6.4 million liters of fuel and releases 20,250 metric tons of carbon dioxide —about as much as the CO2 emissions from 4,300 passenger vehicles. To offset these emissions, we’d have to grow almost 335,000 tree seedlings for 10 years.
Still, this energy use estimate is very conservative. It assumes all roses are imported from Colombia, which means less travel distance than importing from Ecuador or the European Union. It doesn’t include the energy involved in transporting flowers from the Miami airport to their final point of sale or the energy cost of keeping them under constant refrigeration. It also doesn’t account for the waste rate of flowers—the amount that die in transit or arrive too damaged to sell, which averages about 15% from supermarkets and 20% from wholesalers.  
Dr. Nell cautions, however, against concluding that imported flowers use more energy than domestic ones. Although domestic blooms do not require international shipping, they must be grown in temperature-controlled greenhouses. A lack of data in the floral industry makes it difficult to conclude which process is more efficient.
Promising changes
Regardless, we don’t want to take the bloom off your romance. There is good news from the floral industry. As refrigeration technology continues to improve, the floral industry is “rapidly switching” to sea-shipping as an energy- and money-saving alternative to exporting flowers by plane, explained Dr. Nell. “It’s environmentally responsible, less expensive, and the temperature control is perfect,” Nell said. “Energy costs are reduced by 50-60%”
In the United States, greenhouse growers are achieving a variety of benefits by switching to more energy-efficient LED lights. A 2017 US Department of Energy study found that LED technology could slash energy use by 40% if it were used in all horticultural lighting. Because they give off less heat, LEDs cause less evaporation, which means the plants need less water. They also yield better plant growth. Their flexibility in color, position, and brightness can be tailored to fit the growing cycle of a specific crop. This allows growers to reduce the amount of plant growth regulators (PGR) — chemicals, sometimes known as plant hormones, that promote or inhibit plant growth. Using fewer PGRs is healthier for greenhouse workers.      
What you can do
Want to wow your date and be eco-friendly? Here are three tips:
Buy local flowers. You’ll cut out the emissions from travel and refrigerated trucks. If you can’t buy local, look for flowers that are fair trade certified.
Don’t just get roses. Seasonal blooms and local branches, berries, or other flora require less energy to grow and ship than imported roses. You will support your local florist and may be charmingly regarded as unique or creative.
Give an experience instead. According to the National Retail Federation, 40% of people would like to receive a gift of experience, but only 25% plan to give one. These gifts could include a concert, a dinner, or a fun class. Best yet: plant a tree together.

Emerging Opportunities Help Commercial Buildings Optimize Energy Use;"Exciting new opportunities are emerging for commercial buildings to optimize their energy use. These include not only innovative technologies, but also new approaches to system design, building operations, and financing. ACEEE explores three of these opportunities in new topic briefs, released today, as part of our Emerging Opportunities for Buildings series.
Integrated building systems use sensors, controls, and software to manage energy use and optimize performance. Studies show whole-building energy savings of 8-18% with introduction of smart building management systems, but more data are needed from a more diverse set of projects. Other benefits to building owners, managers, and occupants include enhanced fault detection, automation, and improved occupant comfort. Efficiency programs are pursuing demonstrations, pilots, and programs to promote these systems and expand experience with the technology and data collection on savings and benefits. These efforts can help increase adoption of these systems in more commercial building sectors and across building sizes.
Energy storage offers another opportunity for energy efficiency and enhanced energy management in buildings. Thermal energy and battery storage systems can increase peak demand savings for building owners and potentially generate additional cost savings through equipment downsizing. Owners, managers, utilities, other program administrators, and the broader community can also benefit from the added grid flexibility and resilience capabilities these technologies provide. Program administrators are implementing several approaches for energy storage, ranging from technical assistance and rebates to real-time energy storage management. Some utilities are installing energy storage systems on customer premises under ongoing utility ownership and control.
As building owners and managers consider these and other opportunities to improve energy performance in their facilities, vendors are offering innovative models for financing the installation and operation of these technologies and other efficiency opportunities. Our third brief focuses on efficiency as a service (EaaS), a model where the service provider maintains ownership of installed equipment while the customer pays for the energy services provided. The typical EaaS model shifts the burden of financing, owning, installing, and managing the performance of energy assets from the customer to the service provider. A number of providers have entered the market to offer their own EaaS solutions. Case studies show savings range from 10% for a comprehensive LED lighting upgrade to 20-25% for more comprehensive retrofits. EaaS customers benefit from upfront cost savings for efficiency projects, off-balance sheet financing, operations and maintenance savings, lower operational risks, and the opportunity to couple efficiency upgrades with introduction of distributed energy resources including demand response, energy storage, and renewable energy.
In the coming months, ACEEE will release more briefs in the Emerging Opportunities in Buildings series.

Rollback of light bulb standards would cost consumers billions — $100 per household each year;"Statement by ASAP’s Andrew deLaski and ACEEE’s Steve Nadel
The Department of Energy’s plan, announced today, to rescind the expansion of energy efficiency standards for light bulbs would cost consumers billions of dollars and increase pollution that harms public health and the environment.
The expansion, a rule published in January 2017 after a multiyear public process, requires commonly used light bulbs to meet minimum efficiency standards, beginning in January 2020. Nearly three billion sockets in US homes contain these types of bulbs, including globe-shaped ones, reflectors, and candelabras. Today’s LED bulbs meet the upcoming standards, but incandescent ones do not. 
In its rush to deregulate, the Trump administration is hurting consumers’ pocketbooks and public health. Based on an ASAP and ACEEE analysis published in an issue brief last summer, this rollback plan would impose a heavy burden:
Consumers would lose at least $12 billion each year in electricity bill savings by 2025, amounting to about $100 per household per year.
US electricity use would increase by 80 billion kWh per year — about the combined usage of all households in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
This additional energy waste would cause more power plant pollution which harms the environment and contributes to health problems like asthma. Pollution increases would include an extra 19,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, 23,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, and 34 million metric tons of climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions each year by 2025 — the annual CO2 emissions equal to that of more than seven million cars.
DOE’s plan would also stifle innovation, eliminating a powerful regulatory incentive for manufacturers and retailers to invest in high quality, energy-efficient LED light bulbs. LEDs (light emitting diodes), already a great deal for consumers, are available in a wide range of shapes, sizes, color and light output. LEDs cost slightly more than other bulbs, but they pay consumers back through lower electricity bills within a few months, and last 10 years or longer.
The draft rule is open for public comment for 60 days. The rollback plan is most likely illegal, violating a federal law that prohibits DOE from weakening efficiency standards for products such as light bulbs, and will almost assuredly draw legal challenges.
Today’s DOE plan does not affect the 2007 law that requires A-lamps – the traditional pear-shaped light bulbs that occupy an additional three billion sockets in US homes — to meet the 2020 standards.  But DOE is scheduled to issue a subsequent rule in 2019 that may attempt to roll back standards for those light bulbs too.

Electrification and Efficiency: Crafting an Enduring Relationship;"As more states and cities set aggressive policies toward a carbon-free future, the energy industry is abuzz with the concept of electrification. What does this have to do with energy efficiency? A lot! Although some people may assume that efficiency’s reduction in electric use conflicts with electrification’s increase in load, in fact, energy efficiency is central to many electrification strategies. Like many relationships, it’s complicated. If done right, electrification presents opportunities to advance energy efficiency and its many benefits. But if not done carefully, it also poses challenges. Here we briefly explore the relationship between electrification and efficiency and highlight some upcoming ACEEE research and outreach that will further explore the topic.
What is electrification? What is its relationship with energy efficiency? 
Electrification means fully or partially switching from technologies that directly use fossil fuel to those that use electricity. As electricity is increasingly produced from low-carbon sources such as wind and solar, shifting from technologies that use fossil fuels to those that use electricity will often reduce emissions. Electrification also increases load for electric utilities, making it a potential win-win for the environment and electric utilities’ bottom lines. 
A growing set of energy efficiency opportunities in our buildings, transportation, and industrial sectors save energy by switching from inefficient fossil fuel technologies to more-efficient electric ones while often also providing economic, environmental, health, and equity benefits. ACEEE sees electrification as a form of energy efficiency when it saves energy (in total Btus), saves money, and reduces emissions.  
The Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP) argues that electrification is beneficial or in the public interest when it meets one or more of the following conditions without adversely affecting the other two: saving consumers money over the long run; enabling better grid management; and reducing negative environmental impacts.  
But not all electrification is beneficial or energy efficient. For example, electric resistance heat is generally neither because it is often inefficient and can be expensive to run. Local conditions matter, including policies, economics of fuel options, weather, and regional grid mix or load profiles. To a large extent, each state will need to chart its own policies for electrification and its relationship with energy efficiency based on analysis of local market conditions, resource planning, and stakeholder engagement. 
So, electrification is sometimes beneficial and sometimes also a form of energy efficiency:
What technologies bring together efficiency and electrification?
A growing set of energy-efficient technologies are types of electrification, including electric vehicles (EVs) and high-efficiency heat pumps for space and water heating. For the fourth consecutive year, electric vehicles dominated ACEEE’s Greenercars.org 2019 “Greenest list,” which consists completely of vehicles with some form of electric powertrain. Last year we also examined strategies for integrating electric vehicles into the grid and hosted a convening on the topic. This year we will continue to examine EVs’ efficiency opportunities through research, outreach, and convenings, including a utility working group that will explore equity issues in EV deployment and integration.
In the residential buildings sector, we published research last year that found that switching from propane or oil heating to high-efficiency heat pumps can often lower homeowners’ costs, save energy, and reduce emissions in most regions of the country. But as our previous research found, switching from natural gas to electric systems is currently cost-effective from a consumer perspective only in certain parts of the country. And the economics of electrifying residential buildings will generally be more favorable in new construction than retrofits (see here) based on current economics.
Commercial buildings and the industrial sector are areas for more exploration. As Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) examined in research last year, industrial applications are much more complex due to diversity of processes and higher levels of process integration. In 2019, ACEEE will conduct research on electrification and decarbonization opportunities in the industrial sector. We are also interested in assessing commercial building market segments that present the most promising near-term opportunities for cost-effective potential.
Efficiency policies provide a strong foundation for electrification
Some observers falsely view electrification as being at odds with efficiency, questioning why we should pursue efficiency policies to reduce kilowatt hours if we also pursue electrification to increase kilowatt hours. But this misses the bigger picture that both efficiency and electrification can reduce fossil fuel use, costs, and emissions. In fact, efficiency policies become even more important in helping to ensure that increases in electric load from beneficial electrification do not unnecessarily increase electric supply costs or electric system emissions. And from a societal perspective we need large amounts of energy efficiency in the buildings, industry, and transportation sector to meet climate goals.
Take energy efficiency resource standards (EERS) as one policy example. These set long-term energy savings targets for utilities to meet a portion of their energy resource needs with low-cost investments in efficiency programs for customers instead of supply. These programs can also support buildings’ electrification when in the public interest by, for example, installing heat pumps to replace oil or propane heat. Massachusetts’ new three-year energy efficiency targets provide an example. The new targets use multiple metrics to achieve multiple goals, including electricity savings, more-aggressive natural gas savings, and a multi-fuel target set in Btus. Efficiency policies such as those in Massachusetts can be a foundation to leverage beneficial electrification. But good analysis is needed to determine the balance of costs and benefits for different applications and to make sure that targets are aligned with potential savings.
This year, our research will examine how the next generation of energy efficiency resource standards are evolving to respond to interest in beneficial electrification, more aggressive climate and decarbonization polices, calls for improving benefits to underserved communities, and other trends. Energy efficiency can be a foundational policy in in all such cases.
Much work remains to modernize traditional utility business models to encourage energy efficiency, including revenue decoupling and performance incentive mechanisms. Interest in beneficial electrification should not mislead stakeholders into believing that we need to “recouple” utility revenues with load growth, as analysts at National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) point out.
Challenges ahead
Many challenges lie ahead with electrification, including its impacts on the grid and how they will vary by region, time of day, and season, whether the economics will be favorable for customers, and its impacts on equity. For example, EVs will place a large amount of load on the grid, including during peak times, that could increase costs. Utility resource plans will need to understand when and where that load shows up in the distribution system and adjust resource needs in response. Strategies such as off-peak charging and managed charging can guide new load in a way that reduces risks and costs for utilities and their ratepayers. The same applies to use of heat pumps, which can increase early morning winter peaks.
Another important challenge is that electric utilities have an inherent interest in electrification because it increases load, but they do not traditionally have a business interest in efficiency (except where policies such as EERS and utility EE performance incentives have made progress on this front). This means we will need new policies such as separate transportation electrification programs and multiple goals within energy efficiency policies to properly align utility business interests with public policies and consumer benefits.
And of course, there are major challenges from the oil industry, which has frequently opposed either more energy-efficient or electrified transportation systems. We’ve seen its efforts to undercut national fuel economy standards and can expect the same against electrification policies.  
Creating an enduring relationship between electrification and efficiency
With such a complex and wide-ranging topic there are no simple solutions. Each state and city will need its own assessment of opportunities for beneficial electrification and its connection with energy efficiency policies. Comprehensive analysis and stakeholder engagement will serve as pillars to ensure strong policies. This can help the relationship between electrification and efficiency go from “it’s complicated” to one that’s enduring and aligned toward common goals for a clean and affordable energy future.

Brighter, Safer, More Efficient: How Leds Are Changing Public Spaces;"Washington, D.C.’s commute just got brighter—and possibly safer. In late 2018, the city’s Metro made a $50 million dollar commitment to install LED lights in its subway stations. As of January, 15 stations have been upgraded to energy-efficient lighting, with the remaining 33 stations to follow within two-and- a-half years.
The difference is staggering. In addition to being more efficient, LEDs (light emitting diodes) have made stations an average of six times brighter. They make Metro more accessible to people who are visually impaired or have other disabilities. They may also make passengers feel safer and contribute to Metro’s declining 2018 crime rate, its lowest in 19 years.

Several cities are using LEDs to save money and increase the safety of public spaces. While some studies question whether bright lights actually deter crime, others do find an increased perception of safety.
Pedestrians felt safer in areas lit by bright white lights such as LEDs, as opposed to less efficient high-pressure sodium lights commonly used for streetlamps, according to a 2016 study by Antonio Manuel Peña-García, engineering professor at the University of Granada. His research suggests increased ability to recognize faces could be one reason white lights put people at ease. In addition to facial recognition, improved lighting allows citizens and law enforcement to provide more accurate descriptions of clothing color, car color, and other details when reporting crimes or searching for missing persons.
In an interview, Pena-García said higher perceived safety may not actually increase safety, because it “can make people more exposed to crime.” He said LEDs’ greatest advantage is their ability to be easily turned on, off, or dimmed. In contrast, dimming high pressure sodium or metal halide streetlights has negative effects on their lifetime. He adds: “That decrease in lifetime was bad in economic and environmental terms.”
Washington, DC, San Francisco, and the greater Los Angeles area have installed LEDs in poorly lit public transit parking lots and garages. DC’s parking garage LED overhaul has reduced energy use 68% and saved an annual $2 million in operating costs.
LEDs are also being used to reduce collisions along busy roads and highways. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) cites “motorist visibility and traffic safety” as a key factor for upgrading freeway lights to LEDs. Before the upgrade, MDOT’s Robert Morosi said only 70% of Detroit’s freeway lights were operational—a huge safety issue for citizens and first responders. Currently, 99% are.
“While efficient lighting may not eliminate all crashes, well-lit freeways provide a comfort level to drivers,” Morosi told ACEEE, noting this is particularly the case in darkened winter months or in urban areas with multiple freeway interchanges. When asked about the impact of LEDs, he added: “To sum up in one word: safety. LEDs do not only provide better illumination on pavement markings and signage, they provide a sense of security.” In coming years, MDOT plans to extend its LED upgrades to freeway rest areas and park and rides.
Last month, in Cincinnati, Duke Energy began installing LEDs outside two of the city’s largest public high schools to reduce early morning traffic accidents and keep students safer.     
Other cities are taking advantage of smart lighting technology, which can equip LEDs with sensors and other features.
In Chattanooga, Tennessee, city officials were able to reclaim Coolidge Park, an area prone to gang violence and gunfire, by installing remote-controlled LED lights that could be brightened, dimmed, or flashed on demand. When flashing, the lights caused gangs to disperse and reduced violence in the park. Other cities such as Fresno, California, and Peoria, Illinois, are using the microphones in smart streetlights to detect noises that resemble gunshots to expedite emergency response.
Sensors in smart lighting technology can also be used to monitor the environment by measuring temperatures, greenhouse gases, and earthquake vibrations.
LED lights make public spaces more accessible, more comfortable, and more efficient. ACEEE has a toolkit for cities in partnering with utilities to upgrade outdoor lighting; we will incorporate LED lighting upgrades as a metric in our upcoming City Clean Energy Scorecard. While there is no definitive research on whether LEDs reduce crime, they provide many other benefits. LEDs remain a good investment for cities looking to save energy, improve visibility, and help their communities shine a little brighter.

EVs Take Charge of Greenest List as Auto Industry Undergoes Major Shift;"Washington, DC—For the first time in five years, amid transformation in the auto industry, the Detroit Three automakers do not have a single car on the annual Greenest vehicles list. As they make deep cuts to their car fleets, their prior green superstars are either being discontinued, lagging behind, or not yet on the 2019 market. Still, there’s good news for consumers. Highly efficient powertrains and state-of-the-art technology provide plenty of options for buying a greener, more efficient vehicle, according to the 22ndGreenerCars ratings, released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
The federal government shutdown is keeping the Environmental Protection Agency from providing some 2019 models with the certification that automakers need to begin selling them—and that GreenerCars needs to score them. This includes a few vehicles that are expected to score very well, including the Toyota Prius and Tesla Model 3. Today’s release includes the vast majority of model year 2019 vehicles, but ACEEE will score the missing ones in coming months and give them a fair shot at the Greenest List.
“Vehicles with some form of electrification, whether hybrid or battery electric, continue to take every spot on the Greenest List,” said Eric Junga, senior transportation research analyst at ACEEE. “Despite a few automakers’ cutting back on their car fleets to focus on crossovers and SUVs, the Greenest List shows that many consumers have a range of good eco-friendly options.”
The 2019 Greenest List features the most environmentally friendly cars now available. Each car is given a Green Score based on an environmental damage index (EDX), which reflects the cost to human health from air pollution associated with vehicle manufacturing, the production and distribution of fuel or electricity, and vehicle tailpipes.                                                                                                              
Scores for some battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles dropped since last year, the result of a change in the GreenerCars scoring model that updates the accounting of emissions associated with battery manufacturing. Even so, battery electric and gasoline hybrid models dominate the Greenest List, allowing consumers to minimize the environmental impacts of their next vehicle. The Hyundai Ioniq Electric holds its top spot for the third year, with a Green Score of 67. Other regulars include the BMW i3, Kia Soul Electric, and Nissan Leaf.
“By turning to clever vehicle designs and state-of-the-art batteries, automakers are making many of their offerings more efficient, at lower cost,” Junga said. He noted that all electric vehicles on the Greenest List start pricing below $45,000 before tax incentives, and most tout a rated driving range of over 150 miles, bringing EVs one step closer to becoming mainstream vehicles. Even though federal EV tax incentives have begun phasing out for some automakers, prices are dropping and state tax incentives may still be available. Consumers may want to inquire about incentives.
“As these vehicles rise in popularity,” added Junga, “it’s important to remember that the long-term benefit of EV ownership is not only in reduced fuel cost, but also in reduced lifetime environmental impact.”
For those with requirements not quite met by current EV offerings, gasoline hybrids are a great alternative. Popular models make the Greenest List, including the Hyundai Ioniq Blue, a gasoline hybrid sibling to the first-place Ioniq Electric. Toyota’s mid-size Camry Hybrid LE is not only practical but boasts stellar fuel economy. Falling just short of the Greenest List and soon to be discontinued is Chevrolet’s plug-in Volt, one of Chevy’s most efficient models over its nine-year run.
For the fourth consecutive year, the Greenest List contains no vehicle with solely an internal combustion engine. Manufacturers continue to make impressive strides in the efficiency of gasoline engines, but adding even a small degree of electrification can further reduce a vehicle’s lifetime environmental impact despite the emissions from producing batteries.
Greenercars.org also identifies practical options in each class among widely available, automatic transmission, gasoline, or diesel models. The Greener Choices list includes conventional vehicles and traditional hybrids, but excludes plug-in hybrids and pure battery electric vehicles, given the limited availability of charging stations.
The all-new RAV4 shows an impressive five-point jump since last year, the result of Toyota’s own efforts to maximize the efficiency of gasoline engines. Chevrolet’s Spark proves that efficiency can come in an affordable package, while the utilitarian Nissan Rogue Hybrid makes a repeat appearance. Meanwhile, Honda’s all-new Insight grows in size and practicality, while easily out-scoring the iconic marque’s earlier generations.
Greenercars.org also provides a Meanest List, comprised as usual of large SUVs, pickup trucks, and European luxury cars that are the least friendly to the environment. For the first time in many years, Mercedes’ G550 is not the worst of the worst. The recently redesigned luxury SUV improves combined fuel economy from 11 miles per gallon to 14 miles per gallon, just enough to reach the fourth-worst score of 2019.
Green Scores of the 1,200-plus model year 2019 vehicles are available for free in the greenercars.org interactive database, along with each configuration’s fuel economy, health-related pollution impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions. Visitors can also turn to GreenerCars scores to determine eligibility for parking benefits at participating LEED-certified buildings. Greenercars.org also features a write-up on model year 2019 market trends and shopping advice, as well as a consumer primer on vehicles and the environment.
Changes to this year’s methodology include updates to estimates of vehicle lifetime miles traveled, emissions associated with electricity production, and emissions from the manufacturing and recycling of vehicles and their components.

The Ultimate Power Couple: Energy Management and Data Technologies;"Strategic energy management (SEM) programs are expanding beyond the industrial sector to commercial and institutional customers. These programs and data management technologies are two of the biggest opportunities to reduce energy use at large facilities. Not only do they save energy and decrease carbon emissions, they also help utilities build long-term relationships with clients and introduce them to additional efficiency programs.
In a new report, released today, ACEEE analyzed 26 programs in the United States and Canada to evaluate how they are merging these opportunities to maximize energy savings. Our report finds that such programs help organizations identify effective capital projects as well as operations and maintenance actions. It explores the potential for more programs and lays the foundation for accelerating their adoption across North America.
But what exactly do SEM programs do? They give organizations structure and methodology to discover opportunities, implement projects, and maintain practices that save energy. Energy management information systems (EMIS) help customers increase energy savings by automating data collection, integrating analysis of energy and manufacturing process information, thereby enabling data-driven process control. Integrating EMIS into SEM programs can boost the effectiveness of both approaches and ensure the persistence of energy savings by embedding standard practices in facilities.
ACEEE’s report, Features and Performance of Energy Management Programs, reveals that 11 programs focus on EMIS and there are 19 SEM programs that will support EMIS implementations. More programs are being developed.
SEM administrators are expanding their programs, originally targeted at industrial customers, to meet the needs of corporate and institutional customers. They have added capacity to meet customers at many points in their energy management journey and guide them to their endpoint, which could include a certified energy management system such as ISO 50001. SEM programs also help companies integrate and process data using EMIS and other smart manufacturing technologies.
The result? Energy savings—and increased use of complementary efficiency programs. SEM program participants take greater advantage of prescriptive and standard utility offers than non-participants. They spur continuous customer improvement through consecutive energy-saving projects. This changes the conversation between administrators and customers from “Will you do a project next year?” to “What project(s) will you do next year?” 
We propose that SEM programs become a platform for customer engagement. Program administrators can improve their customer service by moving from intermittent, project-driven engagement to continual engagement about energy management.
Based on case studies, our report describes the features and challenges of implementing SEM and EMIS programs across North America. We discuss the potential for additional programs and their impacts. We conclude with recommendations for SEM program design and evaluation, as well as policy considerations to develop and deploy more programs.  
To encourage program growth, ACEEE will support the North American SEM Collaborative, a volunteer-led initiative of SEM program stakeholders focused on advancing the scope and efficacy of SEM programs. ACEEE will host a 2019 SEM Summit prior to our 2019 Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry in Portland, Oregon, August 12-14, 2019.
The summit will feature presentations and discussions on energy management best practices, program structures, measurement of savings persistence, and customer engagement. Our 2019 Summer Study panels will also explore smart manufacturing and other energy management topics including SEM, EMIS, and ISO 50001. We hope you attend and participate in these events. Together, we can promote energy management systems for our largest energy-consuming facilities to reduce energy waste and carbon emissions in the near future.

ACEEE Honors Outstanding Utility Energy Efficiency Programs;"Washington, D.C.—ACEEE is proud to honor 53 of the United States’ leading energy efficiency programs with the Exemplary Program Award. In a national review, ACEEE selected these programs based on their innovation and effectiveness in helping customers increase energy efficiency in their homes and businesses. The awards accompany ACEEE’s publication, The New Leaders of the Pack: ACEEE’s Fourth National Review of Exemplary Energy Efficiency Programs, which profiles model programs.
“These programs deliver energy savings that not only help customers save money, they also benefit the environment by reducing carbon emissions and other pollutants,” said Martin Kushler, a senior fellow with ACEEE. “Moreover, since these programs save energy at lower costs than other forms of new supply, the whole economy benefits. This is truly a ‘win-win’ situation.”
Seth Nowak, lead author and project manager, said ACEEE conducted this national review to recognize outstanding energy efficiency programs and honor the people and organizations responsible for their success.
The 53 recipients include both electric and natural gas utilities, and span a wide range of program types and technologies. Programs range from low-income residential to strategic energy management for large businesses, and from high efficiency lighting to complete building retrofits.
“What is striking about the results of our review is the large number of high quality programs we found all across the nation,” observed Kushler. “We were able to recognize exemplary programs in 23 different states, which illustrates how widespread the efforts to promote energy efficiency have become.”
The full listing of programs can be found in the report.

More States and Provinces Adopt Carbon Pricing to Cut Emissions;"Across North America, efforts to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions are growing, creating a market-based incentive to reduce emissions and energy use. Currently 14 US states and Canadian provinces plus one US city have done so, with seven additional states and provinces in active pursuit, according to ACEEE’s new white paper.  
We profile these state and provincial efforts and explore lessons learned from them. Their progress is important, because federal steps to address climate change are unlikely even though the recent Fourth National Climate Assessment warns of dire climate impacts. While some carbon pricing efforts cover just the power sector, others also cover transportation, buildings, and industry.
Two major approaches are now in use—a carbon tax (sometimes called a fee or levy) and a cap and trade system, both of which can improve energy efficiency. A carbon tax charges a fee for every unit of carbon dioxide that is emitted. While its cost is known, its effect on emissions is less certain. Carbon taxes are now in place in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, and the city of Boulder, Colorado. Massachusetts, Washington state, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and the Canadian Northwest Territories are all seriously considering carbon taxes. Most of these cover multiple economic sectors.
A cap and trade system puts a cap on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and issues emissions permits, often referred to as “allowances” or “certificates.” Emitters can trade these certificates, allowing the market to find the lowest-cost emissions reductions available. With cap and trade, the level of emissions is known. What is less certain is the market price of the certificates. This approach is in place in California, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and nine northeastern states that are part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). New Jersey, Virginia, Oregon, and Saskatchewan are now seriously considering cap and trade programs. RGGI covers just the power sector; the other programs are broader.
Both carbon taxes and cap and trade programs affect energy efficiency in two ways. First, they can raise energy prices, which makes the economics of efficiency more favorable (e.g., if the price of energy is 10% higher, the value of energy savings increases by 10%, all other things being equal). Second, in all of the jurisdictions that we looked at, some of the funds collected are invested in energy efficiency for residents and businesses (or there are plans to begin such investments in the future).
Efforts to price GHGs have been in place for about a decade in British Columbia, Alberta, and the RGGI states, and for five years in California. Evaluations of these programs find that they reduce GHG emissions and promote energy efficiency (the report includes details). One key lesson is that a considerable portion of income from these programs should be invested in energy efficiency. The most successful programs for providing emissions reductions, energy savings, and economic benefits, such as RGGI, devote a substantial share of revenues to efficiency programs. Another important lesson is that many of the programs provide rebates or other special considerations for low- and moderate-income households, helping to cushion the impact of carbon pricing on these households and avoid the public backlash against a carbon pricing proposal in France.
Based on the programs we profile, we recommend that other states and provinces (and eventually Congress) seriously study and ultimately adopt a price on GHG emissions that builds on the lessons from these leaders. However, we find that a price on emissions, while an important strategy, will likely need to be complemented with other approaches to reduce energy use and emissions (e.g., transportation, buildings, and industrial policies) if the US and Canada are to meet long-term emissions goals.

Happy New Year! We Look Back at 2018’s Progress and Challenges and Forward to 2019’s Potential;"In 2018, states, cities and companies made progress on energy efficiency, while the federal government took steps backward. This year holds promising opportunities, particularly at the state, city and business level. Unfortunately, we expect a continued need to defend efficiency standards, targets, and funding at the federal level and in a few states.
State highlights of 2018 include major new energy efficiency laws in New Jersey and Virginia as well as new energy savings targets in New York and increased targets in Arkansas. Many of these states will need to develop the details of these policies this year. Additional states will consider new efficiency policies in 2019, driven by new governors and legislatures. Expect actions in Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada, as well as perhaps Illinois, Maine, and Wisconsin. On the other hand, energy efficiency remains under attack in Ohio and the need for defense there will continue.
At the local level, many cities are stepping up, with 280 pledging “We Are Still In” to the Paris climate agreement targets. Cities are starting to work out the details, such as building benchmarking policies (now enacted in 25 local jurisdictions), expanding access to electric vehicles and public transit, and setting community-wide energy savings or emissions reductions goals. And a few cities are going further. New York City plans to have a new building retrofit law in by Earth Day that would require 20% average energy use reductions in large buildings by 2030, and Washington DC just enacted  a law to require retrofits within seven years to all large buildings that are below the  median level of performance.
Corporate America is also embracing sustainability. A recent report by the Alliance for Industrial Efficiency of 160 firms involved in manufacturing found that 79% of these firms have set public goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 43% have set public targets to reduce energy use. More broadly, a recent CERES survey of more than 600 US firms that account for about 80% of market capitalization found that 64% have commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with just over half of these commitments tied to specific timeframes. Together these surveys show much corporate interest, but also a need and opportunity to strengthen efficiency activities at many of these firms. For example, why do under half of firms in the Alliance study have energy saving targets? We also see a need for better data on corporate investments in efficiency. In 2019, ACEEE will be expanding its work on energy efficiency in corporate sustainability, building on a Topic Brief we published in 2018.
Due in part to all of these actions, overall, energy efficiency employment is increasing -- 2.25 million jobs in 2017, up about 133,000 jobs from the prior year (2018 numbers not yet available).
Unfortunately, federal agencies are headed in the opposite direction. They are proposing to halt the increase in federal fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, roll back the scope of 2020 federal light bulb efficiency standards, and to make it more difficult to set new appliance and equipment efficiency standards. They are also seeking to replace the Clean Power Plan, which would have encouraged more customer energy efficiency, with an Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) plan that is limited to power plant emissions.
So far these are all just proposals, many of them poorly thought out and susceptible to court challenge. For example, the proposal to weaken fuel economy standards is based on faulty analysis, and the lamp standard proposal seeks to get around the federal law preventing backsliding on equipment standards. Final decisions on these rules will be made by federal agencies, and lawsuits will be filed in 2019, but court rulings will likely come in 2020 or even later, making it difficult for companies to plan which vehicles, lamps, and power plants they produce, sell, or procure.
On the other hand, there may be a few legislative opportunities this year at the national level. These include an infrastructure package (which could include improvements to public buildings, the electric grid, broadband, public transit, and EV charging) and perhaps one or more modest energy efficiency bills based on the bipartisan Portman-Shaheen bill, which passed the Senate Energy Committee last Congress.
Finally, major new reports in 2018 warned even more starkly of high costs to the United States and the world from climate change (e.g., costs could be more than $400 billion annually in the US by 2090 – see here), and showed that energy efficiency is ready to make major contributions to slow warming. For example, the International Energy Agency recently estimated that efficiency can produce nearly half of the emissions reductions needed to reach the Paris Agreement target of an 80% cut in global emissions. While the advances in 2018 are not yet of the scale needed to address the challenge or seize the opportunity, many states, cities and companies are showing the way. We hope the federal government will join them.

The Hidden Story on Minnesota’s New Energy Efficiency Potential Study: Efficiency Is the ‘Workhorse’ for Climate Goals;"Minnesota has been receiving well-deserved attention for its ambitious renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals, which aim for 25% of electricity from renewables by 2025 and an 80% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050. Indeed, its largest utility, Xcel Energy announced plans earlier this month to reduce carbon emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030, and completely eliminate carbon emissions from its power plants by 2050.
While renewable energy is the ‘showhorse’ most talked about regarding Minnesota’s efforts, energy efficiency will be a key ‘workhorse’ in achieving those clean energy goals. 
After all, any such goals (e.g., renewables % or GHG reduction) become easier if energy efficiency reduces the amount of energy required. Minnesota has long been among the national leaders in utility energy efficiency, which has helped enable its noteworthy renewable energy accomplishments to date. 
Now a new energy efficiency potential study shows that much more opportunity remains for energy efficiency in Minnesota, which should help pave the way for further progress toward renewable energy and climate goals. The study was coordinated by the Minnesota Center for Energy and Environment (MNCEE), with project partners Optimal Energy and Seventhwave, and assistance from ACEEE and ESource. 
The key takeaway: Electric utilities should be able to continue to meet or exceed Minnesota’s statutory target of 1.5% energy savings per year through 2029, which was the study’s timeframe. In fact, the study estimates that Minnesota’s investor-owned utilities should be able to achieve at least 1.9% savings per year, and municipal utilities and co-ops should be able to do at least 1.7%. (The “maximum achievable” estimate was 2.7% and 2.4% respectively.)
The graph below helps put those savings in context. Excerpted from the final report, it shows the historical energy efficiency spending and savings achievements of Minnesota electric utilities (in gigawatt-hours and as a percentage of total sales), for each year since 2008.
Achieving the study’s identified savings would be a major contribution toward meeting future renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals.  Moreover, utility energy efficiency programs provide considerable economic benefits.  Minnesota has reported that such programs have returned four dollars to the state’s economy for every one dollar spent on them. Net benefits over one six-year period totaled approximately $3.3 billion.
Another key take-away from the study results is that even a state with a long history of aggressive energy efficiency programs still has large remaining cost-effective and achievable energy efficiency potential, albeit with an evolving mix of measures and programs, as the study describes.
In keeping with Minnesota tradition, the study featured an extensive stakeholder process, in which interested parties from a variety of perspectives were able to participate. Discussions focused not only on the study’s technical aspects, but also on the associated policy implications.  Credit goes to MNCEE for managing the 20-month project, and to the Minnesota Commerce Department, Conservation Applied Research and Development Program, for providing the funding for this project. In addition to the full written report (available now), a webinar recording on the study results should be available soon on the MNCEE web site.
One final observation is that Minnesota’s overall policy approach exemplifies the strategy of combining energy efficiency and renewable energy into an overall clean energy agenda. While some states tend to excel at one or the other, Minnesota is aggressively pursuing both components. We salute those efforts and hope for continued success.

ACEEE Partners With Bloomberg’s American Cities Climate Challenge;"Today, Michael R. Bloomberg announced Charlotte as the nineteenth winning city of Bloomberg’s American Cities Climate Challenge, of which ACEEE is an official partner.
“With Washington asleep at the wheel, cities like Charlotte are leading the way in the fight against climate change,” said Bloomberg, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Action. His foundation’s $70 million program, launched in June, will help 20 winning cities accelerate their ambitious climate efforts.
Over the next two years, the Climate Challenge will provide these cities with significant resources, including technical assistance and staff capacity, to help them reduce carbon emissions by saving energy and using clean energy sources. The selected cities will target energy savings in the buildings and transportation sectors, the sectors most responsible for energy use and carbon emissions.
ACEEE will partner with the Climate Challenge by expanding our efforts to monitor and evaluate city actions. Our independent City Clean Energy Scorecard (formerly City Energy Efficiency Scorecard), the premier tool for assessing local energy efficiency policies and programs, will now include a focus on renewable energy and increased emphasis on policy performance and social equity outcomes. The 2019 City Scorecard will expand from scoring 51 of the largest US cities to 75, with the goal of assessing 100 in future editions.
Cities’ climate change commitments have resulted in a spur of innovative activities, and many cities are using energy efficiency to meet their goals. For example, on Tuesday, Washington, DC passed a landmark clean energy bill that requires its utilities to source all electricity from wind and solar by 2032 and its existing buildings to meet energy efficiency standards.
But action is not limited to the Climate Challenge cities. Across the country, local governments are putting efficiency at the forefront of climate action. New York City is building on Local Law 84, which requires property owners to measure, benchmark, and publicly report building energy and water consumption as one step in its plan to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. Most recently, Denver’s City Council passed a revised Green Buildings Ordinance, which requires buildings more than 25,000 square feet to include cool roofs, green roofs, LEED Silver building certifications, or solar panels.
The Climate Challenge cities will serve as models for building public-private and community-based energy efficiency strategies, which can save money, create jobs, clean the air, and protect health. ACEEE is excited to support these cities—and cities across the nation—in their pursuit to save energy and reduce carbon emissions.

Renewables Are Getting Cheaper but Energy Efficiency, on Average, Still Costs Utilities Less;"New data by Lazard, a financial advisory firm, shows that prices for renewable electricity declined again this year, continuing their downward trend. But the data, released last month, miss another critical clean energy resource. Energy efficiency–the kilowatt-hours we avoid by eliminating waste–remains, on average, our nation’s least-cost resource.
Efficiency also delivers a host of other benefits. It improves electric grid reliability and resilience, can target savings where and when needed the most, creates jobs, spurs other economic development, reduces customer utility bills, makes homes and buildings more comfortable, and reduces harmful pollution.
Levelized Cost of Electricity Resources
What do the data show?
ACEEE research published this summer shows that energy efficiency programs cost utilities, on average, about 3.1 cents per kilowatt-hour nationally. It examines program costs and performance incentives for the 49 largest US electricity utilities in the 2015 program year (the data do not include additional participant costs). Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has found similar results in an analysis of 2009-2015 program year data (with a few differences in approach). It has also examined the total cost of efficiency programs, including participant costs.
The average cost of efficiency to utilities is still generally less than that of wind or utility-scale solar. And overall, energy efficiency and clean energy continue to come in at a lower cost per kilowatt hour than more traditional resources.
Worth noting, these are national data; regional data will vary. Also, the levelized cost data in the Lazard analysis and our paper are a simplified and limited metric and they do not tell the full story of the benefits of energy efficiency (or other resources) to utilities. For example, the Lazard data do not include costs for needed storage or transmission and distribution.
How big are efficiency investments?
Investments in energy efficiency can have a big impact. Those made between 1990 and today have helped us avoid building the equivalent of 313 large power plants and have delivered cumulative savings of nearly $790 billion to customers nationwide. The need and opportunity for efficiency as a utility resource will continue in the coming years as states and utilities will need to meet evolving goals.
For example, investments in transmission and distribution have grown significantly over the past decade. This trend means higher costs for customers. Energy efficiency can help keep these costs in check by serving as both a broad-based resource and a distributed energy resource that meets specific time and locational needs on the grid. Efficiency also has a large role to play in reducing emissions and meeting aggressive climate goals for many states and cities.
The good news: Utilities are increasing efficiency investments, helping their customers use energy more efficiently, and meeting demand by saving energy rather than generating it. A recent LBNL analysis projects, in its medium case scenario, that utilities will increase efficiency investments from $5.8 billion in 2016 to $8.6 billion in 2030, a jump of more than 45%.
But will this, or even the LBNL study’s high scenario, be enough to meet states’ growing energy and climate policy needs? Not likely. New and refined policy tools will be needed, such as the next generation of energy efficiency resource standards, utility business models aligned with efficiency, and financing options that help businesses and households leverage public and ratepayer funding to drive deeper savings. Check out our State Policy Toolkit, which can help state policymakers and regulators increase use of our nation’s least-cost energy resource.

19 states value clean air, clean lungs in program planning;"In a wider push to increase energy efficiency, 19 states are incorporating health and environmental benefits into the cost effectiveness testing of utility-run efficiency programs. Quantifying these advantages is a step towards increased funding and broader program offerings. ACEEE’s new topic brief profiles these states and the unique ways they are accounting for the diverse benefits of efficiency.
States vary in how they calculate these benefits, some of which result from reducing energy use and air pollutants. We look at four types of benefits: avoided cost of compliance with environmental regulations, improved air quality and other benefits to the environment, public health gains, and improved health of program participants. Most of the 19 states monetize the value of at least one of these benefits based on jurisdiction-specific studies or estimates from other utilities or areas. Other states use substitute methods.
States that account for health and environmental benefits in cost-effectiveness tests
Many states incorporate these benefits using a traditional cost-effectiveness test such as the Total Resource Cost Test or the Societal Cost Test, as described in the California Standard Practice Manual. Other states have begun using the National Standard Practice Manual (NSPM), which describes a new, policy-focused approach to cost-effectiveness analysis. The NSPM allows states to incorporate their own policy objectives into testing, including efficiency’s health and environmental benefits.
While many states account for a variety of these benefits, we recommend several strategies to increase their impact.
Take advantage of existing cost-effectiveness tests and develop new ones. Although many of these tests allow for the inclusion of health and environmental benefits, quite a few states aren’t including them. States can more fully account for these benefits by taking advantage of the full potential of existing tests and considering new methods, such as the NSPM.   
Quantify more of the health benefits. The public health benefits of efficiency are widely unaccounted for, despite the availability of free tools to quantify them. States can map and monetize the benefits of avoided emissions, including reductions in premature deaths, respiratory and cardiac illnesses, hospital admissions, and missed work days. Where monetization is not possible, using substitute methods is preferable to assuming these benefits do not exist.
Build on existing resources and conduct further research. Although existing resources provide a framework for quantifying health and environmental benefits, additional research is needed to better account for the variety of benefits across jurisdictions and customer types.
ACEEE explored these themes and others at our recent Conference on Health, Environment and Energy. The event brought together experts from the public health, air quality, and energy sectors to discuss the latest research and opportunities for collaboration. Look to the conference webpage for forthcoming links to presentations and other material.
Throughout 2019, ACEEE will expand on this research to better understand the methods for quantifying health benefits and opportunities for funding health and energy-linked programs.

Climate challenge: Cut the ‘gray carbon wedge’ of industrial emissions;"Recent major climate reports highlight public interest in addressing climate change. There is broad agreement that we won’t achieve carbon reduction goals without cutting emissions from the industrial sector, which accounts for more than a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Unfortunately, emissions from industry have received far less attention than those from electricity production, buildings, and transportation. Industrial emissions, described by some as an amorphous “gray carbon wedge,” come from an economic sector that’s exceedingly complex. Understanding them is challenging, and solutions will be both complicated and multifaceted.
Source: IPCC 2014 https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/
I recently gained insights into these questions at a week-long Industrial Decarbonization Workshop, organized by the Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) and funded by the Hewlett Foundation. AGCI staff and the event co-chairs convened industrial energy experts from around the world to better define the challenges and propose solutions. Energy efficiency plays a critical role in reducing industrial emissions, as previous ACEEE research has indicated.
These emissions are dominated globally by several carbon intensive industries: cement, iron and steel, fertilizers and chemicals. In the United States, cement is less important, because we don’t have the scope of infrastructure investments as do some developing economies, such as India and sub-Saharan Africa. However, focusing on just these large emitting industries will not reduce emissions enough to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The entire industrial sector will need to reduce them.
 Source: C2ES 2018 https://www.c2es.org/site/assets/uploads/2018/06/innovation-manufacturing-background-brief-07-18.pdf
Industrial solutions fall into two broad categories: industry specific and cross-cutting. The former deal with direct greenhouse gas emissions from industry processes. To reduce them, options include process improvements, further exploration of carbon capture and storage, and a shift to less carbon intensive materials. Workshop presentations, which will soon be posted online, detail numerous options but many will need additional research and testing as well as major investments in new processes and policies to address the costs of abandoning older technologies. Reducing industrial emissions will require global cooperation on both research and implementation.
Cross-cutting strategies include energy efficiency, electrification of some fossil fuel processes such as steam, and a shift to non-carbon fuels such as hydrogen and biomass. Some of these opportunities are available today but are underutilized, while others will require additional research to bring them to scale in the market.
The workshop explored the possible drivers of decarbonization as well as the economic and social dislocations such as job losses that will likely result from a transition to a low-carbon industrial future. Participants discussed policies to address these challenges, such as carbon taxes that allocate revenue to help displaced workers, expanded research and development funding, voluntary corporate commitments for carbon reductions, and workforce development. Some of these policies are being considered for legislation in the coming 116th Congress.
The workshop participants have agreed to prepare a journal article for publication, which can provide information for corporate leaders and policymakers. ACEEE will address industrial technology and policy issues in its research next year and at the 2019 Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry next August in Portland, Oregon. I hope to see many of you there to continue this essential conversation.

Farm Bill Advances Rural Energy Efficiency;"Statement of R. Neal Elliott, Senior Director of Research
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) applauds Congress for passing the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 today. Known as the 2018 Farm Bill, the Act funds programs that advance and support energy efficiency in rural communities, where energy burdens commonly have an outsized impact on quality of life.
The legislation approves and updates two programs that could benefit rural America: the Rural Energy Savings Program (RESP) and the Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP).
RESP offers low-interest loans to borrowers to make energy efficiency improvements in their homes and small businesses. It lends money to rural electric cooperatives (co-ops) and other rural electric utilities, which then relend the funds to customers or co-op members. Energy efficiency technologies lower energy bills over time, but can have high up-front costs. Many customers in these targeted communities do not have access to financing needed for these upgrades. RESP fills that gap. It can be used for “on-bill financing” programs in which loans are repaid through energy bills.
REAP helps agricultural and rural businesses, including farms and ranches, install renewable energy technologies and energy-efficient technologies by way of loan guarantees and grants. These technologies include heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems; cooling or refrigeration units; high quality doors and windows; electric, solar or gravity pumps for sprinkler pivots; insulation; and efficient lighting. The program is so successful that it is continuously oversubscribed.
The bill also increases funding for rural broadband, which is important infrastructure for energy management. It continues support for the Community Wood Energy Program and National Oilheat Research Alliance (NORA), which each address efficiency of these two uniquely important rural fuels. It also continues the Conservation Stewardship Program, which includes support for energy and water conservation.

  The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.

Can utilities incorporate energy efficiency into their core business? With performance incentives, they can;"As the utility business model changes, more states are offering utilities incentives to increase energy efficiency by making it as appealing as traditional investments. Our new topic brief, released today, explores performance incentives for utilities in 29 states, focusing on nine innovative states in particular.
New Jersey is one example. In September, the state’s largest utility, Public Service Gas and Electric (PSE&G), proposed a six-year energy efficiency portfolio that would allow them to earn a return on their investment. The utility’s proposed portfolio would increase utility investments in efficiency by 60% in its first year, ramping up to a 700% increase in 2024, compared to 2017 utility investments. It would also more than quadruple the number of programs the utility offers, help New Jersey meet its energy efficiency targets, and save customers an estimated $5.7 billion. The proposal is now being reviewed by the state utility commission.
Even with such clear benefits, however, many utilities would be unable or unwilling to invest as much in energy efficiency. Why? Without proper policies, efficiency reduces electricity sales and profits. To counteract this, New Jersey and 28 other states have performance incentive mechanisms (PIMs) that allow utilities to earn rewards for their investments in energy efficiency when they meet certain performance criteria.
PIMs can be structured in different ways. Some allow utilities to earn a share of the net benefits from efficiency investments and others provide a cash reward for meeting energy savings or other targets (called savings-based and multifactor incentives). Another type of incentive allows utilities to earn a rate of return on their efficiency spending as they would for investments in generation or transmission and distribution infrastructure (and these incentives can also be aligned with performance criteria).
Since our last national review of performance incentives in 2015, we’ve seen a notable upward trend in both multifactor and rate of return incentives. The figure below shows the current landscape of utility energy efficiency PIMs.
Rate of return incentives
Four states have adopted rate of return performance incentives, up from one state in 2015. These mechanisms are growing in popularity because they allow a rate of return for demand-side investments in a manner similar to traditional infrastructure investments, which helps to level the playing field for energy efficiency. Rewards are sometimes based purely on spending, but they can also require performance criteria such as certain levels of energy savings.
For utilities that are rapidly ramping up efficiency investments, like PSE&G, rate of return incentives can spread costs out over a longer time period rather than recover them within the year they are incurred. This smooths out the customer bill impacts of large investments and ensures that customers pay for efficiency measures over the many years of receiving their benefits.
In 2016, Illinois set new efficiency targets for its investor-owned utilities. The legislation included performance-based rate of return incentives for meeting or exceeding the targets as well as penalties for not meeting them. The utilities can earn up to 200 basis points for exceeding their targets, or they can lose up to 200 basis points if they fail to meet them. 
Multifactor incentives
Beyond energy savings, states are increasingly working to meet new policy goals. These goals include reducing peak demand (and system costs), reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating savings particularly for low-income customers. To do so, states including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Michigan are using multifactor PIMs, which reward utilities for meeting multiple policy goals.
Massachusetts recently put forth a new and aggressive energy efficiency plan that includes new PIM components. If approved by regulators, the state’s utilities will be able to earn rewards for achieving energy savings, pursuing demand benefits, and providing incentives to customers who rent, rather than own, their homes or apartments. These new incentives encourage program administrators to address multiple policy goals and to accomplish long-term climate goals.
Incentives in power system transformation
Other states, utilities, and regulators are also innovating to achieve their policy objectives. The rise of utility proceedings on utilities optimizing distributed energy resources, including energy efficiency, offers an opportunity to expand utility business model reform options that can support efficiency investment. The right incentives, including PIMs, can lead to increased procurement of non-traditional resources to address emerging system needs.

To inspire energy-saving behaviors, local governments engage residents, hold contests, try games;"Nearly two-thirds of behavior-based programs for saving energy involve in-person contact with residents, such as home energy audits, according to a new survey of 50 such programs nationwide. As energy efficiency programs increasingly target behavior, local governments are taking diverse approaches.
Our new report, Reducing Energy Waste through Municipally Led Behavior Change Programs, shows that the majority of locally led programs use more than one behavior change strategy. It finds that more than half include a competition, game, or educational component.

They target diverse audiences, too
Programs also vary based on their targeted audience. Almost two-thirds focus on residential households and 40% on municipal government operations. While transportation programs are less common, some local governments address energy use in transportation as well as other sectors.
For example, in California in 2016, Alameda County’s Community Commutes Day competition used an online game to encourage employees to bike, carpool, or use public transit. Municipal buildings competed as teams to earn the most points through clean commuting and program engagement.
“Really think about the diversity of your employees and don’t fall into the trap of thinking everyone is like you,” said Sarah Church, Alameda County’s sustainability project manager. In providing advice to other local governments aiming to run similar programs, she added, “Reach out to all groups, even those who you’d least expect to participate, as you may be surprised who will engage.”

They aim to meet climate and other goals
Our study finds that many cities joining We Are Still In or the Mayors Climate Alliance are using behavior change strategies and program designs as one way to help meet their Paris Agreement goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. New York City and Denver, for example, cite their climate action plans as a motivator for designing behavior change programs to save energy.
Local governments cite additional motivations for their programs, such as community engagement, economic development, job creation, and energy affordability. About a third of the programs surveyed focus on serving low-income or underserved households and communities. 
They face challenges
Many cities and counties face challenges in developing and implementing their programs. For example, Virginia’s Arlington County struggled to expand the scope of its Green Games program, which initially targeted energy and water savings in the commercial building sector in October 2010 to 2011. While the original program proved successful because of extensive staff engagement and relationship building in that sector, the county faced barriers such as competing priorities and low participation while trying to expand to the retail, restaurant, multifamily, and hospitality sectors. 
Strong evaluations can help measure success and identify solutions to program challenges, but measuring success can be difficult. Even though independent third-party evaluations are key, the vast majority of cities and counties surveyed did not complete them. Many local governments track some performance metrics internally, but programs would benefit from more robust evaluations.
Piloting and testing new ideas and concepts can also help determine solutions to program challenges.
We identify ways forward
In the new report, we provide recommended steps for local governments to ensure effective programs, such as conducting preliminary research, piloting ideas, and comprehensively evaluating outcomes. By following these steps and learning from past examples, cities and counties can build on these behavior change strategies to design programs that achieve long-lasting energy savings tailored to meet the goals and needs of their communities.

ACEEE Participates in This Year’s Giving Tuesday;"Washington, D.C.—ACEEE is pleased to announce that it will participate in Giving Tuesday 2018, a time for individuals, communities and organizations to encourage philanthropy and to celebrate generosity worldwide. Following Thanksgiving and the widely recognized shopping events Black Friday and Cyber Monday, this year’s #GivingTuesday will take place on November 27.
As a nonprofit organization, ACEEE relies on the support of donors to conduct energy efficiency research and advocate for clean energy policies. Our research-backed policies and legislation are increasingly important in light of a recent United Nations study on climate change and potential US rollbacks of efficiency standards for vehicles, light bulbs, and appliances.
ACEEE’s research has had substantial impact on state, local, and federal policy, driven in part by our well-regarded scorecards that rank cities, states, utilities, and countries for their efficiency efforts. In addition, ACEEE hosts conferences that bring together thousands of energy professionals each year. The Rural Energy Conference, held last month in Atlanta, was the first event to focus on energy efficiency in rural America, prompting Clean Energy Works’ founder Holmes Hummel to hail it as “historic.”
“ACEEE has benefitted from significant growth in interest from individual donors over the past two years,” said Steven Nadel, ACEEE’s executive director. “We are excited to participate in this day of giving that crystallizes the enthusiasm of our supporters and helps spread the message about important causes, including energy efficiency and the environment.”
About Giving Tuesday:
Founded in 2012 by the 92nd Street Y – a community and cultural center in New York City − #GivingTuesday inspired millions of people to give back and support causes they believe in. Its campaigns have raised more than $300 million online in 150 countries to benefit a broad range of organizations. Much more was given in volunteer hours, donations of food and clothing, and acts of kindness.
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.

EIA: Reduced electric demand has halved carbon emissions in power sector;"Finally, some good news! Recent hurricanes and major climate reports have heightened awareness of climate change and the dire need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This week, a blog post from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows energy efficiency is a vital climate solution. Half of the carbon dioxide emission reductions in the electric power sector since 2005 have come from stopping growth in demand for electricity, as shown in the EIA’s graphic. Other research finds that a large part of the demand reduction is due to consumer energy efficiency.
This result confirms the findings in a 2016 ACEEE report that the US economy has grown even as US electricity use has plateaued. The report shows that policy-driven energy efficiency since 1990 has become the third-largest electricity resource in the United States; without it, we would need the equivalent of 313 additional large power plants to meet the country’s energy needs. If savings from appliance standards, utility programs, and building codes reached their full potential, they would become our nation’s largest electricity resource by 2030, providing a wealth of benefits.
Our research has also found that energy efficiency holds the potential for even greater CO2 emission reductions in the future. It can contribute at least half of the 80% reduction by 2050, which many consider the necessary contribution from the United States to meeting climate goals, while growing the economy and saving consumers money.

What will Massachusetts’ new efficiency targets mean for future policy?;"Massachusetts’ new three-year energy efficiency plan includes aggressive energy-savings targets for utilities. The plan, approved Tuesday by the state’s Energy Efficiency Advisory Council and filed for approval with utility regulators, is estimated to cut greenhouse gas emissions and achieve $8.6 billion in customer benefits.
Massachusetts is one of 27 states that have an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS). ACEEE has found that EERS policies, which set specific energy-saving goals, are the most successful way to drive large energy efficiency gains in the utility sector, especially when aligned with utility business models to support efficiency, including performance-based incentives and revenue decoupling. 
While utility regulators in Massachusetts still need to formally rule on the targets, the plan represents months of stakeholder input. The plan helps show how the next generation of EERS policies is evolving to reflect major changes in the energy system and in climate policy.   
Here are five ways the proposed plan indicates a broad evolution in utility efficiency targets:
“Energy Optimization” sets multiple goals and targets multi-fuel savings
The plan pivots from primarily seeking to reduce electric and gas energy usage to a broader system view, helping customers reduce total energy use and their overall utility bills. It describes this as “Energy Optimization.” It sets multiple goals for utilities, including lifetime energy savings from all fuels, including oil and propane savings in addition to electricity and natural gas, in millions of British thermal units (MMBtu). Importantly, the goals also maintain clear targets for electricity savings in lifetime kilowatt-hours (kWh), lifetime natural gas savings in therms, and annual demand reductions in megawatts (MW), among others.
While annual electricity and natural gas targets will no longer be the sole focus, program administrators will continue to report their progress annually. The average annual electricity savings targets are 2.7% of power sales, slightly lower than the previous goals, but the plan’s average annual natural gas savings goal will increase to 1.25%. (The plan notes that rising technology baselines continue to reduce claimable savings, which is a reason for the slight drop in electricity savings targets.) Consumer benefits for the electric programs and the overall portfolio will increase, compared to the prior plan.  
Other states are setting energy efficiency targets in multiple metrics, including total energy use. Earlier this year in its New Efficiency: New York plan, for example, New York announced Btus as a statewide energy efficiency target. These targets complement site electricity or natural gas savings goals to address multi-fuel savings and, when appropriate, allow for beneficial electrification. 
Beneficial electrification can complement EERS policies
With prices for renewable energy decreasing, and the success of efficiency and renewable energy policies increasing, the emissions intensity of power grids has been falling. As this trend continues, beneficial electrification emerges as an important tool for states to meet aggressive climate goals. In fact, we view it as a form of efficiency when it meets three criteria: saving total energy, reducing costs for consumers, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. High-efficiency electric heat pumps and electric vehicles, for example, can be forms of beneficial electrification. 
This summer, Massachusetts enacted An Act to Advance Clean Energy, which expands the definition of energy efficiency to include (among other things) strategic electrification, another term for beneficial electrification. Its new plan follows this direction. Program administrators will offer customers incentives for strategic electrification when it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and minimizes ratepayer costs. We suspect these strategies would also meet our third criterion (saving total energy) and would help program administrators meet the overall energy savings target expressed in Btus. Program administrators will also have specific targets for the number of air-source heat pumps installed.
The plan demonstrates that beneficial electrification strategies and EERS policies can work together. This is important because the concept of beneficial electrification has prompted some observers to ask whether we still need energy efficiency targets in the electric power sector if we are going to electrify these end-uses. In their view, kilowatt-hour savings targets might deter beneficial electrification. However this sets up a false choice. If goals are properly designed, we can reap the benefits of both energy efficiency and beneficial electrification at the same time.
In fact, end-use energy efficiency can become even more important in helping to ensure that any increases in electric load from beneficial electrification do not result in unnecessary increases in electric supply costs or electric system emissions. To accomplish this integration, multi-fuel targets and other good policies can help optimize consumer and societal value. The new Massachusetts plan takes a major step in that direction.
Utility efficiency targets play central climate role
Many states have set long-term climate goals. Increasingly, policymakers are recognizing the large role efficiency can play in meeting those goals. States can still incorporate more cost-effective efficiency, even those that have been working on efficiency for decades, including Massachusetts and California. Massachusetts’ 2019-2021 efficiency plan is estimated to reduce emissions by nearly 2.8 million short tons of CO2e. The state accounts for the greenhouse gas  benefits of energy efficiency in cost-effectiveness testing, recognizing that efficiency reduces the costs associated with emissions reduction. Other states with aggressive climate targets should follow suit in ensuring that EERS policies, along with full accounting of efficiency’s benefits, are a central part of their climate strategy.
Expanding participation to those most in need
ACEEE research has found that some customers face higher energy burdens —the share of their income spent on utility bills — than others, and that energy efficiency can reduce those bills. Massachusetts has a long track record of success in reaching low-income customers, and its 2019-2021 plan continues to focus on serving income-eligible customers in partnership with the Low-Income Energy Affordability Network. As strongly encouraged by the efficiency council, administrators would increase efforts to serve all customers, including renters, moderate-income residents, and non-English speakers. In addition, utilities will tailor evaluations to better understand participation levels and remaining barriers for businesses, residential customers, and non-English speakers.
Performance incentives continue to evolve
Our 2015 research on utility performance incentives found that financial mechanisms for efficiency performance were linked not only to annual kWh targets, but increasingly to multiple goals. We identified at least five states with multifactor incentives. For example regulators in Rhode Island dealt with very high peak energy prices by adding demand-reduction incentives, in addition to those aligned with kWh savings goals.
The Massachusetts 2019-2021 plan moves in this direction. It would set a statewide performance incentive mechanism with four components for the electric goals, detailed in the term sheet and plan.
Looking ahead
Massachusetts has ranked #1 in our annual state energy efficiency scorecard for the past eight years. Its new efficiency plan sets an aggressive path, and we look forward to reviewing the final details approved by its regulators. The plan provides a window into the evolution of state EERS policies and offers other states target-setting strategies.
ACEEE is launching research on the next generation of EERS policies to examine how they are evolving to meet changing energy system needs. Please reach out to us if your state is working on these changes and you want to learn more. Over the past two decades, these policies have steadily delivered low-cost, reliable energy savings for utility customers while reducing emissions and providing multiple societal benefits. We want the next generation of EERS policies to continue to play a central role in meeting our nation’s energy needs and climate goals.

The sustainable sugar rush: how candy companies are saving energy;"When you reach for that candy bar this Halloween, don’t just count calories—count kilowatt-hours. Big candy manufacturers use a lot of energy to feed our sugar addiction, especially this time of year. The average American consumes about 22 pounds of candy per year, which is the weight of roughly 2,200 Hershey’s kisses.
That’s a lot of candy. “[We’re] good at making chocolate…but we’re not an expert in producing power,” says Winston Chen, the renewable energy manager for Mars Incorporated.
Thanks to energy efficiency, Mars soon won’t need to use as much power. As concerns about energy consumption, water depletion, and climate change rise, your favorite candy companies are taking energy-saving steps to improve their business models and meet their sustainability goals.
These efforts are part of a broader corporate sustainability push. ACEEE encourages companies to use energy efficiency to meet their sustainability and profitability goals. (Read our recent issue brief and case studies on the topic.)
Although many corporations are making progress in sustainability, they still face challenges. The candy industry is confronting deforestation, trying to reduce water use, and working to improve labor practices, including eliminating child labor. While it is important, energy efficiency is only part of what makes a corporation both environmentally and socially responsible.
On the efficiency front, which is the scope of this blog post, the big candy companies are taking steps forward.
Mars
Headquartered in McLean, Virginia, Mars makes Snickers, Milky Way, M&M’s, and Twix. The world’s largest candy company, it employs more than 110,000 people at factories across the globe, including 50-plus factories in the United States. It cites energy efficiency as a key way to meet its sustainability goals while managing company growth.
Last year, Mars announced it will spend $1 billion to improve company sustainability and will devote one-third of that funding to water and energy efficiency. Its goal is to reduce its energy intensity (energy use per unit GDP) by about 2% annually and to improve its energy efficiency in direct operations by 10%, from 2015 levels, by 2020.
In the past three years, the company has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 10% through efficiency and renewable energy, which powers 100% of its US operations, according to Mars’ most recent sustainability report.
Mars’ upgrades range from large-scale changes such as improving manufacturing equipment to smaller adjustments like switching its factories to LED lighting—which is also great way to improve energy efficiency in your home.
Hershey
You know Hershey from Halloween favorites like Kit Kats, Reese’s, and, of course, Hershey’s Chocolate. But did you know about its sustainability efforts?
The Hershey Company has committed to reduce candy packaging, carbon emissions, and overall waste by 25% before the year 2025—and improvements in energy efficiency are a crucial part of meeting these goals.
“We use a fleet of electric cars in Hershey [Pennsylvania],” says the company’s 2017 Corporate Sustainability Report (CSR). Hershey has two cogeneration facilities in Monterrey, Mexico, that have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 17,938 tons—the annual emissions of about 3,500 cars—by converting natural gas to electricity.
To save energy, Hershey replaced chillers at three US manufacturing plants and upgraded refrigeration controls at another plant. It optimized the loading of its trucks to reduce vehicle miles traveled, according to the company’s 2016 CSR report.
Last but not least, Hershey invests in energy audits to ensure it is as efficient as possible. Try this at home—learn how an energy audit can save you energy and money here.
Lindt & Sprüngli (USA) Inc.
Lindt is best known for Lindor Truffles and Lindt chocolate bars. This February, in partnership with Eversource, Lindt launched a three-year strategy to save 3.5 million kilowatt hours per year—enough to power 500 US homes for a year—at its Stratham production facility in New Hampshire
“Over the next few years, we will complete a number of renovations and construction projects that will enhance the efficiency of our processes,” said Davide Nico, vice president of operations at Lindt Chocolate USA. These renovations include an energy-efficient central chiller plant, state-of-the-art ventilation, rooftop cooling units, and a wastewater heat recovery system. Like Mars, Lindt USA is also installing LED lights.
More broadly, Lindt aims to reduce both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 2% annually, relying partly on energy efficiency, according to its 2017 sustainability report. Excluding Russell Stover, a 2014 acquisition, the company says it cut energy consumption per ton by 18% between 2008 and 2017. It used thermal insulation, energy recovery, and optimized transport routes. Globally, it says, one-third of its power now comes from renewable sources.
While candy companies’ efficiency efforts may not reduce the calories in your Halloween haul, they may lower the kilowatt-hours involved in making all those goodies. Happy munching!

Saving energy can strengthen our electric grid;"Turning on a light switch is a simple act that masks a very complex system. That light is powered by the electric grid, the world’s largest machine, operating in real time. We are growing more and more dependent on electricity, but we often take this incredible machine for granted—until the power goes out, as can happen with extreme weather events. Ensuring grid reliability and preventing interruptions requires balancing electricity supply and demand.
Today, in a new report, ACEEE shows that energy efficiency is often an effective but underutilized way to ensure such balance. It has clear reliability benefits, but those benefits are generally not adequately included and quantified in grid planning and decision-making. As a result, there are too few investments in efficiency measures, and higher grid costs as a result.
Reducing energy use in our homes, businesses, and factories lowers power demand on the grid, which can boost electric system reliability. It also saves money, and can be cheaper than alternative grid investments, such as new supply resources or transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure.   
Energy efficiency is a viable and valuable system resource—the “first fuel” of choice for its ability to offset electricity supply. Historically, much of the effort to improve grid reliability has been dedicated to ensuring that supply resources can meet the growing demand for electricity. However, industry leaders, regulators, and operators increasingly recognize that reliability depends on a mix of approaches, including energy efficiency.   
A dramatic example of this role occurred almost two decades ago, when California and other areas were threatened with extensive outages due to market supply problems. California officials and utilities greatly increased their customer energy efficiency and load management efforts. The result? Sufficient savings that literally kept the lights on.
More recently, regional transmission operators are including energy efficiency in their resource planning. For example, ISO New England and PJM allow it in their capacity auctions; efficiency suppliers submit bids to reduce demand as an alternative to bids from others that increase supply.
Energy efficiency is an especially valuable resource to decrease system peak demands and grid loads in geographically targeted areas. Reducing peak demands provides grid relief, and can offset the need to purchase or produce high cost electricity. By providing targeted load relief to congested points in the grid, it is a key element in “non-wires alternatives,” and helps reduce costly upgrades to T&D systems.
Valuing efficiency’s reliability benefits
Our report highlights several efforts to quantify efficiency’s reliability benefits. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council includes a value for risk reduction due to energy efficiency programs in its regional power plants. Pacific Gas & Electric uses a value for avoided distribution reliability costs, while Rhode Island and New York are in the early stages of developing methods to value efficiency’s benefits. The National Standard Practices Manual recommends such benefits be quantified and included in screening and evaluating energy efficiency measures and programs. Despite these examples, such practices are not widely used.
In a rapidly changing utility industry that relies more on distributed energy resources, energy efficiency’s value to grid reliability is becoming even more evident and important. Properly accounting for this value in grid decisions and investments can lower electricity costs and improve the grid we depend on—keeping our lights on and our economy running.

Zero energy buildings on the rise but barriers remain;"Zero energy building codes are making inroads in Oregon, California, British Columbia, and other places, but a new ACEEE white paper reveals that they still face barriers to nationwide success, including a “solar-only” mentality.
From coast to coast, there’s considerable momentum for zero energy buildings, or ZEBs, which produce at least as much energy as they use over the course of a year. To make a building zero energy, designers first minimize the building’s energy use with high-efficiency walls, windows, HVAC equipment, and energy management systems. The remaining load is met with on-site renewable energy, typically solar photovoltaic panels. 
British Columbia unveiled its voluntary zero energy “step code,” which its local governments could choose to adopt, in April 2017. A few months later in November, Oregon announced it would begin incorporating zero energy strategies into its building codes beginning in 2019. This year in May, California adopted a new building code that requires all new homes be zero electricity by 2020 and new commercial buildings by 2030. Other active zero energy plans are underway in Vermont, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.
Despite this progress, ZEBs face resistance. One such barrier is a “solar-only” mindset, which focuses on adding solar to a building without considering energy efficiency. However, ZEBs without efficiency are generally a higher-cost approach, and energy efficiency offers a number of nonenergy benefits such as improved comfort and resilience.
Still others feel that the overall goal should not be zero energy buildings with on-site renewable energy, but instead efficient buildings with community renewable energy options. This position overlooks the fact that ZEBs and community storage do not need to be an “either/or” proposition. We can still pursue ZEBs now, and both on-site and community generation can co-exist in a clean energy future.
A final barrier is disinterest in energy-efficient or zero energy buildings. ZEB advocates can overcome this barrier by developing code-improvement proposals and supporting voluntary programs that encourage and support ZEB construction. ACEEE’s new whitepaper, Pathways to Zero Energy Buildings through Building Codes <<link>>, outlines proposals for upcoming code cycles that would help push the model energy codes toward zero energy. It updates a more in-depth 2014 ACEEE study, Energy Codes for Ultra-Low-Energy Buildings: A Critical Pathway to Zero Net Energy Buildings. 
Improvements to model building energy codes can take a variety of forms. Code updates could focus on specific building equipment, such as improving management of plug-load energy use, increasing HVAC efficiency, or including solar-ready roofing and connections. They can also comprise broader changes to the codes themselves, such as developing an informative ZEB appendix, improving performance path scores, or creating an outcome-based performance path that emphasizes efficient ongoing performance and not just design.
Where national model codes face resistance, cities, states, and municipalities can step in and update their own codes to incorporate these measures. Strategies like stretch codes and voluntary programs can help shift the industry toward ZEB codes and improve acceptance of some of the proposed changes.
As British Columbia, Oregon, and California show, the future is bright for zero energy building codes, but it will require substantial effort to get there on a national scale.

IEA reports large energy efficiency gains but calls for accelerated efforts;"Energy-saving efforts continue to deliver vast gains, but their progress is slowing and will need at least a doubling of investment in order to reach global sustainability goals, according to the International Energy Agency’s new Energy Efficiency 2018 market report, released last week.
The sixth annual report by the IEA, a Paris-based organization formed and led by 30 developed countries, includes striking data on the value of energy efficiency. While global energy use has grown by a third since 2000, the figure below shows that the increase would have been more than 50% greater without efficiency.
Changes in global energy use 2000-2017 and results of decomposition analysis on contributions to these changes.
However, while efficiency savings are substantial, the IEA finds that the rate of improvement is slowing. The chart below shows that global energy intensity (energy use per unit GDP) fell by 2.5% in 2011, but that the rate of improvement slowed to 1.7% in 2017, and would have dipped even more, to 1.2%, if the 3.9% improvement in China were not included.

The IEA finds that much more efficiency savings are possible in its “Efficient World Scenario” (EWS), which includes improved efficiency policies and increased investments. In the EWS, as illustrated below, global energy efficiency savings increase more than three-fold relative to 2017 savings. The largest savings are in the transport sector, but substantial savings can also be found in the buildings and industrial sectors. The scenario only includes current technologies but assumes very aggressive implementation of them; on balance it seems a reasonable projection of the achievable global potential savings.
2040 global energy use and efficiency savings in the IEA Efficient World Scenario (EWS).
To achieve the EWS efficiency savings, IEA recommends increased government action, both regulatory measures such as building codes and equipment efficiency standards as well as providing information on efficiency opportunities. The agency also recommends expanding access to financing, such as use of energy service companies (ESCOs), green bonds, and green banks. It calls for a doubling of average annual investment in energy efficiency between now and 2025 and then another doubling between 2025 and 2040. These are all reasonable steps, and in line with actions that ACEEE has been espousing.
In transportation, the agency recommends a focus on vehicle fuel economy and electric vehicles. In industry it notes that the bulk of potential energy savings are in less energy-intensive sectors because these sectors have historically paid less attention to energy efficiency. And in buildings it notes that energy use can be reduced about 40% on average through more efficient new construction as well as retrofits of existing buildings.
The IEA shows the importance of these energy efficiency actions to meeting the global sustainability goals of the Paris Agreement.  It provides a “Sustainable Development Scenario” to meet the Paris targets combining energy efficiency with investments in renewable and nuclear energy, fuel switching, and carbon capture and storage. As illustrated in the figure below, 44% of the emissions reductions in this scenario come from energy efficiency — the largest contributor to a plausible scenario reaching the world’s sustainability goals.

The IEA report shows that the world is not getting the savings it needs from energy efficiency to develop economies and reduce climate change. While energy efficiency has contributed a lot, far more investment and policy support are needed for a sustainable future.

ACEEE Statement on the International Energy Agency’s Energy Efficiency 2018 Report;"ACEEE welcomes the release of the Energy Efficiency 2018 report from the International Energy Agency (IEA). The report underscores efficiency’s critical role in meeting greenhouse gas reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement and highlights the disappointing news that efficiency investments have slightly decreased in the United States and China.
Energy efficiency remains a vastly untapped resource despite being a proven strategy for meeting growing energy demand worldwide and a key driver of economic, social, and environmental progress. The report’s finding that global energy demand rose by nearly 2% in 2017 indicates a need for a significant increase in efficiency policies and programs in both emerging and established economies.
This is especially relevant in light of the alarming findings from the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, released earlier this month, which states that global greenhouse gas emissions must drop by 45% by 2030 from 2010 levels for the world to meet its Paris Agreement commitments.
We endorse the IEA’s support for key efficiency policies, including stronger fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, appliance standards, and deep building retrofits.  As governments consider ways to significantly cut their energy use while also growing their economies, they can turn to the ACEEE International Energy Efficiency Scorecard, which provides policymakers with a roadmap of policy options and best practices in the buildings, transportation, and industrial sectors that will help optimize efficiency investments and maximize reductions in energy consumption.

Virginia’s new energy plan holds promise: Here are seven steps for success;"Governor Ralph Northam’s new 2018 Virginia Energy Plan (VEP), released earlier this month, rounds out a busy year for clean energy policy in Virginia. It contains policy and program recommendations that will, if thoroughly implemented, deepen energy savings and expand clean energy in the Commonwealth. It proposes that the governor establish a goal to reduce energy consumption in state buildings 20% by 2022, continue robust energy savings performance contracting, and practice more-thorough energy data management. The VEP also proposes a cumulative statewide combined heat and power target and reinforces the value of state and private financing for customer energy efficiency programs. ACEEE is glad the VEP includes several recommendations we put forward in our comments. Now it is time to put them into action.
The VEP and SB 966
While the state government is already a leader on energy efficiency, utilities in Virginia have historically invested minimally in it. In a recent ACEEE ranking of the 51 largest US electric utilities on energy efficiency programs and policies, Dominion Energy Virginia (Dominion)—the largest utility in the Commonwealth—ranked 50th. But soon, that could change. Earlier this year the Virginia General Assembly passed the Grid Transformation and Security Act (SB 966) to require Dominion and Appalachian Power Company (APCo) to ramp up spending on efficiency programs and the State Corporation Commission (SCC) to engage stakeholders in planning. The VEP echoes these requirements. While SB 966 should drive significant utility sector energy savings, it is not a done deal. Utilities will still need to have efficiency programs approved by regulators, who have historically relied on outdated cost-effectiveness testing methods and rejected programs that would almost certainly gain approval in other states.
Here’s how the governor can help:
Facilitate coordination with the SCC, utilities, and advocates. Governor Northam can provide guidance for the SCC-convened stakeholder collaborative, defining the expected purpose, outcomes, and group methods. Emphasizing a consensus-driven approach and regular meeting schedule can help ensure the process is robust and inclusive.
Encourage the collaborative to engage a consultant to conduct an energy efficiency study. The SCC can use these results to set annual long-term, cost-effective, and achievable energy savings targets for utilities.
Fund a full-time energy office employee to engage in utility sector energy efficiency efforts. This staff member can help align state and utility programs, for example, by coordinating state-funded efficiency programs for low-income households with local weatherization programs and utility-delivered programs for these households. The energy office can also offer efficiency programs to fill gaps in utility programming (e.g., programs for industrial customers).
Support legislation to require strong, long-term energy savings for electric and gas utilities. More than half of states have energy savings goals for utilities, the most effective way to guarantee energy savings. Utilities can also set their own energy savings targets and use pilot programs to test new program models and emerging technologies.
Support legislation to give utilities financial incentives to invest in energy efficiency. A business model that encourages such investments and aligns with performance toward energy savings goals can help ensure that efficiency programs are sustainable.
Support alignment of cost-effectiveness tests with Virginia’s policy goals. A balanced, Virginia-specific test would help regulators, utilities, and stakeholders get on the same page in designing and delivering efficiency programs. As a guide, they could use the National Standard Practice Manual, developed by efficiency experts.
Promote independent oversight of utility-sector evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) and establish a stakeholder EM&V working group. This would improve efficiency program data, bring transparency to EM&V decision making, and help regulators ensure prudent use of ratepayer dollars. Many Virginia stakeholders supported this during a recent public comment process.
Virginia is at a crossroads. The Virginia Energy Plan and SB 966 lay out a path of clean and efficient energy choices, and their implementation will require commitment and involvement from the governor. We look forward to supporting the next steps in the process and are excited for the central role that energy efficiency can play in Virginia’s energy future.

How can blockchain save energy? Here are three possible ways.;"Blockchain is generating a lot of buzz as a promising system to verify and track peer-to-peer transactions in the energy sector. It could have multiple applications although there is still debate about which, if any, will work well. What’s clear, however, is that companies are already exploring uses of blockchain to save energy. Let me tell you about three applications that show promise.
Companies including Walmart and Maersk are already using blockchain to track products along a supply chain. The technology records every transfer and financial exchange. This reduces processing and administrative costs (which can add up to 20% of overall shipping costs) as well as product spoilage. By matching shippers with carriers, it may also increase equipment utilization and decrease fuel consumption. According to the American Trucking Association, truckers in the United States drive more than 29 billion miles a year with partial or empty truckloads.
A second blockchain application could spur the adoption of electric vehicles, which use considerably less energy than most gas-fueled vehicles. EVs need recharging to go long distances, and new software apps enable individuals to rent out their private charging stations. These apps use blockchain technology to record such peer-to-peer transactions. EV owners can use the rent revenue to cover the cost of their charging stations and cars, thus enabling more people to buy EVs and use less energy.
In a third application, energy service companies (ESCOs) are exploring ways to use blockchain to simplify the bookkeeping associated with energy performance contracts (EPCs). These companies help organizations such as schools, hospitals, and office buildings save energy by taking over many energy management responsibilities. They make investments and implement energy measures and, in exchange, get a share of the energy cost savings. EPCs are a cost-effective way for organizations that don’t have the necessary capital or technical expertise to implement their own energy savings measures to reduce their energy costs.
One challenge with EPCs is that they involve multiple parties—customers, ESCOs, utilities, and financial institutions—each of which keeps its own records of energy costs, savings, and expenses. As you can imagine, with so many different sets of books, there is the potential for errors and disagreements. The contracts can also be administratively expensive. Blockchain brings transparency, agreement, and trust through the shared ledger. ESCOs are exploring blockchains with smart contract features that integrate the rules for determining energy savings and the conditions for authorizing payments and penalties. These contracts will automatically release payments after the contract’s conditions are met. Such automation can reduce transaction costs, enabling it to serve smaller organizations—those not previously targeted because the savings were insufficient to cover the costs. The more facilities ESCOs engage, the more projects they will implement and the more energy savings they will achieve.
These three blockchain applications all address challenges in existing markets and have the potential to accelerate market growth. They may not be the most significant energy-saving applications, but because they’re already being piloted, we’ll soon see results. We’ll find out whether the buzz about blockchain is just hype, or if this technology can really deliver new levels of efficiency.
As you can tell, I enjoy discussing how technology affects people’s use of energy. Later this month, I will be speaking about blockchain at two events. On October 17, I will present at the World Energy Engineering Congress (WEEC) in Charlotte, North Carolina, and on October 26, I will be at the 2018 KEEA PA Energy Efficiency Conference in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. If you are attending either event, I hope you will join the conversation.

Join ACEEE and 320-plus groups today to celebrate Energy Efficiency Day;"  Statement of Steve Nadel, executive director of ACEEE
Today is the third annual Energy Efficiency Day, an opportunity to share with others the transformative benefits of saving energy. Energy efficiency is the heart of a clean energy future. It saves Americans billions of dollars each year on utility bills, supports at least 2.25 million direct jobs and, by avoiding power plant emissions, it cleans our air, protects our health (avoids 30,000 asthma cases each year), and helps address climate change.
More than 320 organizations, companies, and utilities are participating in today’s event —#EEDay2018. The US Senate and at least 43 cities, counties, states, and universities have issued official proclamations recognizing October 5, 2018 as Energy Efficiency Day, including Atlanta and Los Angeles as well as Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin.
The United States is moving ahead on energy efficiency, particularly at the local and state level,  as shown in our newly released 2018 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. So please join us in sharing the good news. Email colleagues and friends, or share posts on social media (here’s a toolkit). Replace an old light bulb with an LED, or consider the other energy-saving tips on ACEEE’s SmarterHouse.org for consumers and college students.
And finally, please show your support by signing up as a participant on the Energy Efficiency Day’s campaign’s website, hosted by regional and national groups, including ACEEE, that want to raise awareness about efficiency’s importance.

ACEEE 2018 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard;"States up efficiency investments & power savings; push net-zero buildings & electric vehicles; NJ, CT, CO, SD improve most; MA and CA lead
Washington, DC— As the US government loosens environmental rules, states are investing more in energy efficiency and delivering increased power savings, according to the 2018 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. This 12th annual report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), released today, identifies the leaders (Massachusetts and California), the most-improved states, notably New Jersey, the states that lost ground such as Iowa, and those lagging behind, including North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
The scorecard offers mostly good news about energy efficiency — the nation’s third-largest electricity resource. In response to federal efforts to freeze US vehicle and appliance standards, quite a few states worked to retain their own standards and to promote electric vehicles as well as zero-energy buildings. While some, like Iowa and Connecticut, saw legislative attacks within their states, others — including Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Colorado, and Arkansas — unveiled plans to boost investments in efficiency and clean energy, often driven by concerns about climate change.
The scorecard, which ranks states based on 32 metrics in six areas, has these key findings:
New Jersey improved the most, moving up five ranks to #18. The Garden State set new annual energy savings targets and took steps to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate cap and trade emissions compact. Missouri, Connecticut, Colorado, and South Dakota showed marked improvement. Other improved states include Nevada and North Carolina.  
Massachusetts continued to rank #1 overall. It launched a plan to set new three-year energy savings targets and approved utility spending for grid-scale modernization. A close second is California, which led efficiency efforts in three areas: buildings, transportation, and appliances. These leaders are followed by Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, New York, Oregon, Minnesota, Washington, and Maryland.  
Iowa fell the most, moving down five spots to #24. This drop was due mostly to a bill signed earlier this year (SF2311) that imposes a restrictive cap on efficiency programs and allows customers to opt out of paying for some of them. Sixteen other states also fell in the rankings.
States increased investments in energy efficiency in the utility sector. They spent nearly $8.0 billion last year, up from $7.6 billion in 2016. The result was a 7.3% increase in electricity savings (nearly 26.5 million megawatt-hours) — enough to power about 2.5 million US homes per year. 
States ramped up efforts to promote zero-emission vehicles (ZEV), mostly electric, as the federal government sought to freeze fuel economy standards for cars and SUVs. California joined with eight other states in rolling out an updated ZEV plan, which incentivizes consumers to buy ZEVs. Missouri moved to incentivize the rollout of more EV charging stations, and Oregon to require new buildings be ready to charge EVs.
More states pushed for zero-energy construction (buildings that produce as much power as they use) largely through tougher building codes. California calls for all new homes and commercial buildings to be net zero-energy by 2020 and 2030, respectively. Vermont, Rhode Island, Oregon, Washington, the District of Columbia and Massachusetts have incorporated net zero-energy construction into long-range plans.
“States are stepping up on energy efficiency, including major new commitments in New Jersey, New York, and Virginia, helping to address the very limited activity from Washington, DC,” noted ACEEE Executive Director Steve Nadel. “These efforts contributed to the 2.25 million-plus efficiency jobs last year in the United States.”
Massachusetts' Governor Charlie Baker said: ""We are proud Massachusetts leads the nation in energy efficiency for the eighth year in a row, and we will continue to adopt and pursue measures that deliver billions of dollars in savings to our residents and businesses each year. Massachusetts remains committed to leveraging energy efficiency and clean energy to meet climate goals, reduce costs and grow the Commonwealth’s economy.”
New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy said: “The fact that New Jersey has emerged as the most-improved state speaks volumes on the state’s commitment to becoming a 100 percent clean energy state by 2050. We’ve made enormous progress in very short order, but there remains more hard work ahead. I look forward to New Jersey’s continued leadership on making our environment healthier, cleaner, and more sustainable for future generations.”
California Energy Commissioner Andrew McAllister said: “Modern energy efficiency facilitates renewables integration and reduces the scale of investment required for our ongoing, rapid transition to reliable, emissions-free energy systems - thus boosting our economy and protecting the health of all Californians.” 
Rhode Island’s Governor Gina Raimondo said: “I am proud that Rhode Island continues to be a national leader in energy efficiency. Every day, we’re continuing to make our energy supply cleaner, more affordable, and more reliable. These programs have saved businesses and families more than $200 million in the past three years alone, while at the same time helping us fight climate change and creating thousands of new clean energy jobs.”
  Weston Berg, lead author, discusses Scorecard findings.
States ramped up efforts to create the utility of the future. Ohio, Rhode Island, New York, California, and Minnesota have major plans in place. They’re looking to modernize grid infrastructure, leverage data, and deploy more distributed energy resources.
California and Vermont led in setting appliance standards. California, which has standards for 100-plus products, set new standards for computers, computer monitors, and portable electric spas in 2017. This year Vermont adopted new standards for 16 products.
States focused on innovative financing solutions. Six states (California, New York, Connecticut, Hawaii, Nevada, and Rhode Island) have set up green banks, and Washington, DC, passed legislation this year to do the same.
The scorecard assesses state policies and programs in six areas: utilities, buildings, transportation, state government, combined heat and power, and appliance standards. It highlights best practices for promoting energy efficiency, typically the lowest-cost way to meet customers’ energy needs.  Such efficiency improves air and water quality, strengthens grid resilience, promotes equity, and improves health and comfort.

Stormy weather ahead: Federal agencies begin to roll back efficiency policy;"More than 600 days into the Trump administration, amid constant reports of regulatory rollbacks, there’s been surprisingly little damage to energy efficiency…yet. But now the administrative winds are starting to blow, rulemakings are under way—with a couple open comment periods—and we are working hard to hold onto the energy savings we have been helping to build.
The Obama administration had some remarkable successes on energy efficiency. We estimated that its appliance, vehicle, and power plant standards alone should save over 10 quadrillion Btu per year by 2030 (equivalent to about half of US home energy use), and should cumulatively save consumers over $2.5 trillion in energy bills by 2040.
How resilient are those policies and programs? Here are some local weather reports:
Vehicle standards are facing a gale. The Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently proposed to roll back the fuel economy and emissions standards for cars and light trucks for 2021-2025 (EPA had already determined that the standards set in 2012 are too high), and to block California and other states from implementing higher standards. This would waste 14 billion gallons of fuel a year. The draft is open for comment through October 26, and ACEEE already gave preliminary testimony.
EPA is chopping away at the standards for heavy trucks as well, issuing a proposed rule to exempt gliders (new trucks with old engines), and considering repeal of the standards on truck trailers. There already are lawsuits related to all of the vehicle standard issues, with a stay on the trailer standards.
The Clean Power Plan also is blowing in the wind. EPA last year proposed repealing the rule on greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, and recently proposed a much weaker replacement rule that would only seek modest efficiency improvements at the plants (and gave it a different catchy name, the Affordable Clean Energy rule). It is open for comment through October 31. Meanwhile, the Clean Power Plan also is blocked by a court stay.
Appliance standards have been frozen in place. Due to a unique provision in the law, the Department of Energy (DOE) cannot weaken existing standards, so most of the standards appear to be safe. But the agency also has not proposed a single update and has now missed a dozen legal deadlines. And four standards that the Obama DOE had issued but not yet published in the Federal Register remain in limbo after 20 months (DOE has appealed a court order to publish these standards).
Worse, DOE is preparing a draft rule that could try to roll back one of the biggest-saving rules ever—a definition that applies 2020 light bulb standards to a wider range of commonly used bulbs. Mysteriously, a document on full repeal of the definition appeared on, and then quickly disappeared from, DOE’s website. Such a rollback would be taken to court. DOE is also working on procedural changes that could weaken the program.
Manufactured housing standards never got off the ground. A 2016 DOE draft rule based on a consensus agreement between manufacturers and efficiency advocates has never been finalized. Now DOE is considering a weaker standard or maybe no standard at all, while the Department of Housing and Urban Development considers weakening the existing HUD code for manufactured homes (in which the energy provisions have not been updated since 1994).
All of the above are proposed or potential actions. There have been a couple small final actions. HUD reversed its earlier support for Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing, barring the Federal Housing Administration from insuring mortgages on homes with PACE assessments. And DOE issued a required determination (only a few months late) that ASHRAE 90.1-2016, the model standard for commercial buildings, saves energy. This will encourage more states to update their commercial building energy codes.
Meanwhile, federal energy efficiency programs continue working despite roadblocks. ENERGY STAR® is still the leading mark of energy efficiency, and has set and updated some product specifications, despite a White House attempt to end it and a draft bill that would have gutted it. Congress seems set to pass level funding for the second year in a row. And although the administration proposed drastic cuts to DOE efficiency programs, Congress actually increased funding for this year when it finally passed a bill in March, and has slightly increased funding for next year. Although the money is there, getting it out the door has been an increasing problem, made even worse because there still is not a Senate-confirmed assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at DOE.
While the near-term forecast does not look good, we are working to limit the damage as much as we can. And as unpredictable as the course of a storm may be, we know that the one certainty about the weather is that it will eventually change.

2018 State Scorecard will look at dramatic twists and turns in energy efficiency;"If 2018 were an energy-saving roller coaster, the 2018 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard would be your souvenir photo capturing a year of promising highs and a few stomach-churning lows in efficiency policy.
Next Thursday, ACEEE will release the 12th edition of the Scorecard, an annual report ranking all 50 US states and the District of Columbia for their work on energy efficiency and highlighting the best practices of top-achieving states, as well as those showing marked improvement. While energy-saving efforts were challenged on multiple fronts this year, particularly federal-level vehicle and appliance standards, the 2018 Scorecard provides plenty to celebrate at the state level, such as the rollout of ambitious plans to ramp up savings in states including New Jersey, New York, and Virginia.

The progress is even more evident when contrasted with our inaugural report in 2007. Since then, the buildings sector has seen four major updates to strengthen efficiency in IECC and ASHRAE building energy codes. Also, the number of states with an energy efficiency resource standard―setting clear long-term utility savings targets―has more than doubled, jumping from 12 to 27. Driven by strong policies, the amount of incremental annual electricity savings reported by utility-administered efficiency programs has more than tripled.
As state efficiency efforts have matured over time, so too has the Scorecard. We continue to refine and improve our scoring metrics to reflect the ever-evolving efficiency landscape at a time when grid modernization, increasing data access, and a growing embrace of new utility business models are opening new possibilities for customer choice and use of energy efficiency as a resource. Our methodology has come a long way over the years, due in large part to the support and cooperation of state energy office and utility commission staff who take time to respond to our data requests and the numerous subject matter experts who provide review and feedback.
What’s Changed in 2018?
You may remember that last year’s report added a new metric to highlight state efforts to address the uniquely high energy burden experienced by low-income households. This year’s Scorecard has a few surprises in store as well. They include expanding our scoring of utility savings to include savings from unregulated fuels like fuel oil, propane, and kerosene, which remain a significant source of home heating in many northeastern states. In addition to providing an improved account of total fuel consumption and savings, this new metric also helps align the Scorecard with a growing effort among states to transition to an all-in fuel-neutral approach to decarbonization and an increasing focus on shifting energy use away from high-emissions fossil fuels.
Other updates include slight revisions to our scoring of state performance in the buildings sector, such as formally transitioning our scoring of building energy codes to the New Buildings Institute’s Zero Energy Performance Index. Introduced last year, this new index uses data from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory that are based on modeled energy use intensity, building type and distribution, and regional climate zones. We hope this new approach will provide a more standardized approach to assessing state-adopted codes.

Energy Efficiency Day is two weeks away: Here’s what you can do;"In just two weeks, on October 5, you can join a nationwide campaign (#EEDay2018) to shout out the multiple benefits of energy efficiency, from reducing energy waste and saving money to lessening pollution and creating jobs.
No need to wait, though. You can let others know now about the third annual Energy Efficiency Day by emailing colleagues and friends or sharing posts on social media (here’s a toolkit). You can take other steps too, such as replacing an old light bulb with an LED, planning events to spotlight efficiency, or asking local officials to issue a proclamation (here’s the text for that).
If you haven’t done so already, consider signing up as a participant on the campaign’s website, hosted by regional and national groups including ACEEE that want to raise awareness about efficiency’s importance.
Last year, more than 300 individuals, organizations, companies, utilities, and local governments were official supporters. The US Senate, six states, seven counties, and 19 cities issued proclamations recognizing October 5 as Energy Efficiency Day. Elected officials tweeted their support, including Boston mayor Marty Walsh and Knoxville mayor Madeline Rogero. Big businesses did so as well, with tweets from Walmart Today, PG&E, Cree Inc., and others.
Please join us in making this year’s celebration even bigger. Here are a few other ideas for participating and sharing the good news:
Post photos and stories on social media that describe how you or our organization is saving energy. Please include not only #EEDay2018 but also #EEDayPhotos so we can collect the images. Another approach: say what energy efficiency means to you and ask others to do the same, also with the #EEDay2018 hashtag.
Check out the energy-saving steps on the campaign’s website or on ACEEE’s SmarterHouse.org, which includes tip sheets for consumers and college students. Some steps are simple, such as regularly changing furnace filters, washing clothes using full loads in cold water, reducing the temperature of your water heater (to 120°) and dryer; and turning off electronics when not in use (and, of course, the lights!) Watch our quick consumers’ guide for more ideas:
Share these powerful messages about energy efficiency, the country's third-largest electricity resource: It saves US consumers billions of dollars each year on utility bills, up to $500 per household from appliance efficiency standards alone. It supports at least 2.25 million direct jobs and, by avoiding power plant emissions, it cleans our air, protects our health (avoids 30,000 asthma cases each year), and helps address climate change.
Stay tuned to hear more about promising efficiency efforts all across the United States in ACEEE’s upcoming 2018 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard.

Beyond the burbs: Saving energy in rural communities;"We identified a few common barriers, based on our interviews with utilities and their associations, state energy offices, and third-party efficiency program implementers. They found it challenging to inform rural customers about services, find trained workers locally, or do cost-effective installations, because the customers are geographically dispersed. Some cooperatives and small municipal utilities have insufficient funding and limited staff capacity to offer efficiency services. Several small utilities are investing in energy efficiency, but because they don’t collect performance data, evaluating their success can be difficult.
We also found examples of efficiency programs overcoming these challenges. As an example, for the past couple of years, Efficiency Vermont has partnered with the Vermont Department of Housing and Community Development to integrate energy efficiency improvements into small town revitalization efforts. They use word-of-mouth program marketing and target select communities on a rotating basis to deliver the biggest benefits possible.
Opportunities
A few promising trends emerged. Many of the program implementers we reviewed engage rural community partners, including community-based nonprofits or cooperative utility associations. For example, the Florida Office of Energy works with soil conservation districts to understand farmers’ growing cycles. These partnerships give program implementers valuable feedback on community members’ needs. Additionally, several programs help develop the local energy efficiency workforce. For example, Energy Trust of Oregon partners with community-based nonprofits to encourage local contractors to integrate energy efficiency into their work. To learn more about energy efficiency and local workforce development, check out our recent report.
An array of generation and transmission cooperatives and utility associations help their member utilities save energy for their customers. The Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation and the Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency (SMMPA), for example, both administer efficiency programs on behalf of their member utilities. SMMPA offers programs for small businesses like the hardware store pictured below. Some state policies include smaller utilities (which often serve rural customers) in their energy-saving goals.

How Might Electrification Affect Electric and Gas Systems? Recent Studies Shed Both Light and Heat;"Electrification is gaining a lot of attention as efforts mount to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and address climate change. ACEEE sees an important role for energy efficiency in these efforts. In fact, we see beneficial electrification – that which reduces total energy, costs, and emissions – as a form of energy efficiency. It can complement traditional efficiency approaches, and together, they can help meet energy, GHG, and economic goals.
With this in mind, I’ve looked at three recent studies on electrification’s potential impacts on the electric grid and the demand for natural gas. Taken together, these studies indicate that beneficial electrification will likely increase electricity sales (perhaps substantially), affect peak demand (winter peaks in some regions), decrease use of fossil fuels by end-users, and possibly increase use of natural gas for electric generation. However, none of these studies seems to include substantial efforts to use energy efficiency to reduce energy demand. Such efforts could reduce the costs and grid impacts of electrification.
National Renewable Energy Laboratory study
In July 2018, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) published a study, Electrification Futures Study: Scenarios of Electric Technology Adoption and Power Consumption for the United States. It looks at the electric system under three scenarios – reference (moderate electrification, in line with the Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook), medium (widespread electrification among what it terms “the low-hanging fruit” of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and select industrial applications), and high (transformational change). In the reference scenario, electricity consumption increases 21% over the 2016-2050 period (using moderate assumptions about technology change), resulting in a compound growth rate of 0.65% per year. In the medium and high scenarios, this growth in electric consumption is 45% and 67%, respectively (compound annual growth rates of 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively). NREL’s study includes modest energy efficiency actions; with more extensive such actions, growth rates would be lower. Most of this electricity consumption growth occurs in the transportation sector, with more modest contributions coming from buildings and industry as shown in the figure below.
Electricity consumption by scenario (Source: NREL2018 Electrification Futures Study).
NREL reports: “Electrification would also lead to reduced use of gasoline, diesel, and natural gas fuel. Demand-side fuel use reductions of 74% gasoline, 35% diesel, and 37% natural gas in 2050 are found in the High scenario, relative to the Reference. It is possible that some of the reduced on-site natural gas use would be offset by greater gas-fired generation.”
Also, as illustrated in the figure below, NREL notes that electricity demand currently peaks in the summer over most of the United States (due to cooling loads, depicted in orange below), but with electrification, winter peaks will be more likely, particularly in the northeast and perhaps the southeast as well (shown in blue below).
Estimated peak load magnitude and seasonal timing by state for 2015 (left) and 2050 in the high scenario (right). The size of the pie charts corresponds with total electricity demand (GW) during the top demand hour. The pie wedges show the seasonal distribution of the top 100 hours with the highest demand by state (Source: NREL2018 Electrification Futures Study).
  The NREL study does not document its sector-specific assumptions very well, particularly for the commercial and industrial sectors. Better documentation of these sectors, and likely further study, is needed.
Electric Power Research Institute study
The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), an industry trade association, released a report in April entitled US National Electrification Assessment. Like NREL, EPRI also looks at electrification opportunities in transportation, buildings, and industry out to 2050 under several scenarios. EPRI has four scenarios – conservative, reference, progressive, and transformation. The results are summarized in the figure below.
Source: EPRI 2018 US National Electrification Assessment.
Broadly, EPRI’s findings are similar to NREL’s, with electricity consumption increasing 24–52% over the 2015-2050 period, depending on the scenario. It shows “total final energy” use (site energy use) decreasing, but does not report total source energy use (which includes inefficiencies in power generation, transmission, and distribution). If these losses were included, substantially less energy would be saved. It is unclear how much end-use efficiency EPRI includes in its analysis. It estimates carbon dioxide emissions reductions of 19-67%, depending on the scenario, with 20% reductions in the reference scenario and 56-67% reductions in its progressive and transformation scenarios. Interestingly, it shows a 40% increase in natural gas use in the reference case over the 2015–2050 period due to substantial construction of new natural gas power plants. Natural gas use still grows 18% in the transformation case, as EPRI estimates that even in this case, carbon-free generation (renewables and nuclear) would be not quite half of generation, and most of the rest would come from natural gas, albeit much with carbon capture and storage built in the 2020s and beyond. I am concerned that it overestimates the amount of new natural gas generation.
American Gas Association study
The American Gas Association (AGA), another industry trade association, published a study in April entitled Implications of Policy-Driven Residential Electrification. This study has a narrower scope, examining just converting residential fossil fuel space and water heating systems to heat pumps. It examines the economics of halting sales of fossil fuel space and water heating systems in 2023 and ultimately converting 60% of these systems to heat pumps by 2035. Its economic analysis looks at conversion costs, and also the impact of these conversions on electricity demand, particularly winter demand. AGA’s analysis includes substantial costs for new electric generation and transmission systems under two scenarios, one using market-based generation and another using only renewables generation. Its cost breakdown is summarized in the figure below. AGA finds that electrification will be very expensive, increasing consumer costs by $590–1,186 billion on a cumulative basis over the 2016-2035 period (2016$). Based on these costs, it concludes that residential electrification is an expensive way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Source: AGA 2018 Implications of Policy-Driven Residential Electrification.
These figures should be considered upper-end estimates for several reasons. First, the scenario examined is fairly extreme – prohibiting new fossil fuel systems just five years from now. I have not seen any proposal calling for such a quick change. Second, it assumes that at temperatures below 4°F, all heat pumps will function in electric resistance mode, an expensive way to provide heat and one that would exacerbate winter peaks. Heat pumps specifically designed for use in cold climates can currently be more efficient than electric resistance at temperatures to about -15°F, reducing operating costs (e.g., see here for some Minnesota field test results). Efforts to weatherize homes at the time these heat pumps are installed will reduce loads and the need for electric resistance heat. Furthermore, some existing homes will use natural gas or other fuels rather than electric resistance at very low temperatures, as shown by the Minnesota field study.
Third, AGA assumes that 60% of all natural gas, oil, and propane systems will be converted, rather than a more logical conversion scenario that emphasizes the most cost-effective applications, such as homes with oil and propane heat (discussed in a recent ACEEE study) or new construction (discussed in a recent Rocky Mountain Institute study). Fourth, the power plant and grid cost assumptions are not referenced in AGA’s report, but based on communications with AGA and ICF (consultant to AGA), I have learned that the California Public Service Commission’s input assumptions for integrated resource planning, published in September 2017, were often used as a resource for modeling assumptions. It appears that demand response to manage new winter peaks is not included in the analysis. Demand response will often be a less expensive way to meet a portion of peak demand rather than building additional generation and transmission (see here and here). I would also note that AGA’s costs to convert a home to heat pumps are higher than those in the above-referenced ACEEE study.
While the total cost estimates in the AGA study are likely high, the report includes an important useful detail – the costs of electrification relative to business-as-usual are not distributed evenly among regions. Net costs are highest in cold regions, particularly ones that primarily use natural gas (e.g., the plains, Midwest, New York, and New England) and net costs are much lower in other regions such as the South, Texas, and West. These results are consistent with prior ACEEE research on the economics of natural gas conversions by region and indicate that efforts to electrify homes using natural gas may currently make the most sense in the South and West.
Making Sense of These Different Findings
These NREL and EPRI studies paint a consistent picture of rising electric demand under electrification scenarios, particularly for the transportation sector. Electric system planners should factor these potential loads into their forecasts, particularly when planning for system needs in the 2030s and beyond. All three studies indicate that winter peaks will become more common, another issue that should be factored into electric system planning. In ACEEE’s view, both the overall growth in electricity sales and the winter peak impacts can be moderated with more investments in energy efficiency. Furthermore, while US utilities have a lot of experience with summer-peak demand response reductions, more attention needs to be paid to winter-peak demand response options.
Impacts on the natural gas industry are much less clear. AGA is clearly worried about loss of residential loads. The NREL study indicates a 37% reduction in natural gas sales to end users in its high scenario by 2050, lower in other scenarios. This indicates that natural gas distribution will still be extensive in 2050, but that stranded costs (prior investments that cannot be recovered) could be an issue. Managing costs and cost recovery to handle such a large reduction in sales, without high stranded costs, will require attention from policy makers. However, the EPRI study indicates that if natural gas is used to increase generation, total natural gas use could increase. Given this range of potential outcomes, further analysis of natural gas consumption by sector under different scenarios would be useful. NREL notes in its July 2018 report that it is planning such a study.
Even the reference cases in the NREL and EPRI studies project some electrification, particularly in the transportation sector. For the residential sector, recent ACEEE research has found that some applications (oil- and propane-heated homes and homes in the South) can meet the criteria for beneficial electrification discussed above. For these applications it can make sense to electrify the next time a heating or cooling system or water heater needs to be replaced. But for many homes, electrification may not currently make sense and as a result, natural gas use will likely continue for decades, particularly in the North. All this said, electrification efforts are still in their infancy with many uncertainties. Resolution of these uncertainties will likely take years.

States’ energy use correlates with efficiency policies, new data suggest;"Energy use per capita varies widely by state, according to new data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The lowest is in Rhode Island, where people consume five times less energy than those in Louisiana, which has the highest rate.
Perhaps not surprisingly, we see correlation between per capita energy use and state policy. That becomes clear when you look at how EIA’s data compares with our State Scorecard rankings; the states with the lowest overall energy use per capita (Rhode Island, New York) typically rank among the highest in the State Scorecard rankings (3rd and 7th in the 2017 State Scorecard, respectively). Similarly, the states with the highest overall energy consumption per capita (Louisiana, Wyoming) typically rank in the lowest positions in the Scorecard (44th and 49th, respectively).
Soon, we’ll release the 2018 State Scorecard to reveal how states fared over the past year.
According to the EIA data, the industrial sector consumed more energy per capita than the transportation, residential, and commercial sectors. That helps explain why states like Louisiana, with energy-intensive activities and lower population densities, use so much energy per capita. Other factors include climate and geography. For example, Hawaii had the lowest per capita energy use in the residential sector because of its mild climate and mostly coastal population.
State policy also matters. That’s why publications like the State Scorecard that track actions states can (and do) take across all sectors are such important tools for policymakers. States have a variety of policy tools at their disposal to help control their energy consumption, even in energy-intensive sectors.
ACEEE has been tracking these efforts for 12 years, and every year there are new policy innovations that help states save energy. Will states like Louisiana and Wyoming, with high energy consumption per capita, move up in our rankings in 2018? Will Rhode Island and New York remain in our top tier?
Stay tuned for our 2018 State Scorecard!

California must go big on energy efficiency to be carbon-free by 2045;"California’s official push toward a carbon-free electricity system, now awaiting the governor’s signature, will need dramatic contributions from energy efficiency to succeed.
Last week, lawmakers passed SB 100, mandating that power generation come solely from clean sources like wind and solar by 2045. In the interim, the bill increases the state’s Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements in 2024, 2027, and 2030, to 60% by 2030. If signed, California would follow the lead of Hawaii and many US cities in moving towards 100% clean energy-based power.
Some utilities and regulators have questioned whether there’s still a role for energy efficiency in a future where renewable energy and storage costs continue to plummet and where clean energy provides 100% of electricity. The answer is a resounding yes — in fact, energy efficiency is crucial to ensuring the transition to a 100% clean energy future is effective, low cost, and equitable.
Efficiency is affordable and abundant
Energy efficiency remains the cheapest and largest zero-emissions resource, and efforts to reach a low carbon future without it will be more expensive and less likely to succeed. Recent research by Berkeley Lab (corroborated by similar work here at ACEEE) finds that efficiency is still the lowest cost resource that utilities can procure for their customers, costing an average of 2.5c/kWh across the US and 3.1c/kWh in California. These average program costs have stayed steady in recent years and are lower than utility-scale wind and solar on a levelized, unsubsidized basis. Efficiency also delivers valuable co-benefits that support a clean energy economy: making homes comfortable and healthy, creating productive workplaces, and boosting grid reliability.
Energy efficiency is also a big resource. It’s already the third largest in the US power sector, and is especially robust in California, a leader in saving energy for four decades. Nonetheless, it remains an enormous opportunity for the state. In 2015, California enacted SB 350, which committed to doubling statewide cumulative energy efficiency savings by 2030 relative to 2015. A recent California Energy Commission (CEC) study found that current programs could save more energy if they pursued more aggressive pathways, leaving additional savings available to meet these ambitious goals.
Not only is efficiency abundant and inexpensive, it’s also necessary to meet the broader US goal to cut emissions 80% by 2050. In a 2017 report released by the Natural Resources Defense Council, energy efficiency made the largest contribution to mitigating emissions (including reductions in vehicle miles traveled in the transportation sector) — larger than renewables, and almost as much as renewables and end-use electrification combined.

Efficiency boosts grid flexibility
Integrating renewables into the grid may lower system costs, to a point. But doing so can become increasingly expensive and technically difficult when renewables account for nearly 100% of the power supply. One way to address this challenge is shifting electric loads to the times of day when renewables are available or lower cost, and away from when they’re not.
Energy efficiency supports the demand-side flexibility needed to effectively shift loads. Berkeley Lab’s research finds that some, but not all, efficiency technologies generate more savings during peak times when grid costs are highest. In Arizona, Arizona Public Service’s 2018 DSM plan suggests that some efficiency measures are less valuable midday, an off-peak time when solar is abundant. The utility used this argument to reduce funding for HVAC and new construction programs.
Although it’s important to consider the time-value of energy efficiency in grid and resource planning, APS’ strategy is misguided. Though energy efficiency can be costly during times of abundant renewables, it still has benefits that outweigh those costs when considered across the whole year. A recent Strategen analysis of customer savings in Arizona finds lower customer bills for each of the efficiency measures in APS’ portfolio, even taking into account the value of efficiency at different times and projected growth in solar.
Rather than reduce efficiency efforts to integrate renewables, we should simply build on existing programs. Targeting investment in efficiency technologies that save at peak times can certainly benefit the system and customers. Locational or time-based incentives, or marketing campaigns that build on existing programs, can support using energy efficiency to shift loads. And efficiency technologies can more directly help shift energy demand and avoid ‘throwing away’ renewable resources through curtailment. With the right controls, efficient heat-pump water heaters, smart thermostats, or electric vehicles can turn off or reduce their draw on the system since they may not need electricity from the grid at the moment they are used.
In addition, off-peak or broad-based efficiency such as building envelope improvements help integrate renewables. They ensure flexible technologies like load-controlled air conditioners are effective and not wasted through leaky buildings.  Finally, even off-peak energy efficiency can reduce grid demands and, over time, needed investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure — one of the largest benefits of energy efficiency.
Efficiency makes clean energy available and affordable for all
Recent California legislation, including SB 350, focuses on the impacts of fossil fuel extraction on disadvantaged communities, ensuring they will receive some of the benefits of clean energy development. Renewables can lower system costs, but many people, especially renters, cannot directly benefit from them. They may lack the funds or credit to invest in these technologies, or live in multifamily housing, remote or underserved communities.
In contrast, energy efficiency can benefit everyone, regardless of income or location. It can also directly improve the health and comfort of homes and buildings. While significant barriers remain to deliver efficiency to all Californians, promising models are emerging. The Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing Program supports solar and efficiency in multifamily housing, requiring an energy audit to identify the most promising opportunities. Combined solar and efficiency models offer a clear path forward for delivering clean energy to all.
As California implements this bold new legislation, it should build on its rich history of energy efficiency in utility programs, building codes, and resource planning to ensure the success of its 100% clean energy future.

Next week, we’ll learn more about efficiency workers. On Thursday, E4TheFuture will release its 2018 Energy Efficiency Jobs in America report with data for each state, county, metropolitan area, and congressional district.
As we celebrate Labor Day, we introduce you to a few of these workers and salute all who help build a clean energy future.
“Every day, I feel like I have put some joy in somebody’s life,” says Bryce-Schanhals, who saves people money by slashing their utility bills. She manages the Aiken Electric Cooperative’s Help My House on-bill program in South Carolina.
Gordon shares her enthusiasm. A machine operator at Eco-Panels, which makes structural insulated panels, he says customer appreciation is one of the best parts of his job. He’s also proud of his work: “We’re actually doing something good for the world.”
Perrin, a carpenter in North Carolina, says she loves weatherizing homes. By lowering their energy bills, she helps people pay rent or mortgages and avoid homelessness. She also takes pleasure in making homes more comfortable.
In every US state, across industries and technologies, people work to save energy. As our recent multimedia project shows, they design, make, or install ENERGY STARÒ-certified products or install insulation and advanced building materials.
  Many other jobs are related to energy efficiency as well. At least 650,000 US workers focus on vehicle fuel economy or alternative fuel vehicles and another 4.2 million sell or distribute ENERGY STAR appliances and building materials — along with other products, according to the 2018 U.S. Energy & Employment Report (USEER), compiled by the National Association of State Energy Officials and the Energy Futures Initiative.
These numbers are conservative. They don’t include jobs in energy-efficient manufacturing or combined heat and power systems. They also don’t include indirect jobs that result when customers spend or invest the money they save in lower energy bills somewhere else in the economy.
We know that effective public policy can boost employment. In July, we reported that national standards requiring appliances and equipment to be more energy efficient created or sustained nearly 300,000 jobs in 2016 and will support 553,000 in 2030. These jobs are primarily created when energy bill savings are spent on other goods and services.
Standards for light bulbs are a particular success story. Stronger standards slated to take effect in 2020 account for nearly one-fifth of the expected 2030 jobs. By expanding the market for efficient LEDs (light emitting diodes), the standards will lower LED costs and save consumers money — an estimated $180 for an average US household in 2025.
Unfortunately, the Trump administration may soon attempt an illegal rollback of these standards, putting those savings and jobs at risk.
On a positive note, the 2018 USEER said employers expect the energy efficiency workforce, which grew more last year than the workforce of any other energy sector, will increase 9% this year.
Bryce-Schanhals finds her job very rewarding. She says her clients appreciate when her program's home upgrades save them money: “If I run into people on the street or they come to our annual meeting, they give me hugs.” Though now a senior citizen, she adds: “I just don’t want to retire.”

Energy efficiency helps rural households afford energy bills;"In rural South Carolina, Maxine Stroman struggled to pay her energy bills. Her husband had recently died, leaving her the sole source of income for their two young children. “I had to make some choices on whether to pay my high energy bill or cut back on my grocery bill or cut back on other day-to-day necessities,” she said.
Her fortune changed after her home was weatherized through the Aiken Electric Cooperative’s Help My House on-bill program, which slashed her monthly electric bill from about $400 to $230 and improved her indoor air quality. “I can now actually afford to pay my bill,” said Stroman, a resident of Aiken, a town on the state’s western tip. “[The program] really did change my life.”
Like Stroman, many residents of rural communities throughout the United States have high energy bills, often because they live in poorly insulated homes with old lighting, appliances, and furnaces. Marilyn Bryce Schanhals, manager of the Aiken Electric Cooperative program, said that many of the homes in its service area are mobile homes. “They’re losing energy through leaky ductwork,” she said, “and we want to help them to reduce that loss and cut down on their monthly costs.”
A recent report by ACEEE found that rural residents have energy burdens (the percentage of household income spent on energy bills) that on average are about 40% higher than those of metropolitan dwellers. Particularly hard hit by high burdens are rural low-income, elderly, and renter households, as well as those residing in manufactured and multifamily housing.
Energy efficiency and home weatherization programs can greatly reduce this burden and make energy bills affordable, especially in rural communities. By evening out indoor temperatures, they can also make a house more comfortable. Rural utilities can offer a variety of programs to help reduce their customers’ energy bills.
In the fall ACEEE will release a second report on rural programs that explores lessons learned from program leaders across the country, and in October we will hold our first-ever Rural Energy Conference in Atlanta. We invite you to become part of the dialogue as we meet to discuss how to improve and expand efficiency programs that serve rural communities.

Zero energy ready homes gain ground: Summer Study speaker highlights trend;"The push toward efficient, high-performance buildings has entailed cutting-edge technologies and programs. Next week, at ACEEE’s popular biennial Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, more than 350 speakers will explore this promising trend — from data analytics and connected devices to building codes and federal programs.
Register - Only a few days left
A notable success is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR® Certified Homes program, which has seen phenomenal growth since its launch in 1996. This voluntary labeling program, already with 1.8 million certified homes, is well on its way to two million homes. Sam Rashkin led this effort until moving to the US Department of Energy to launch the Zero Energy Ready Homes (ZERH) program in 2012, which calls for greater energy efficiency.
At Summer Study, Rashkin will offer key takeaways of his experience. Chief architect of DOE’s Building Technologies Office, he will present the paper, “What We Learned Getting to 2 Million ENERGY STAR Certified Homes that is Positioning Zero Energy Ready Homes for Exponential Growth.” He said that while many factors contributed to the first program’s success, five were critical: energy efficiency, a supply chain, targeted goals, market-ready specifications, and effective messaging.
In a phone interview, excerpted below, Rashkin talked about the prospects for the ZERH program.
How is the program faring since its 2012 launch?
We have built a great foundation for zero. Every month, there are significant indications that we’re really getting to the tipping point. In the last few weeks, we picked up a 5,000-unit development in Fort Collins, Colorado, which is very significant because it’s 100% zero-energy ready. Late last year, we picked up a 3,200-unit development in Prescott, Arizona.
The label is really getting a lot of recognition. We add up everything going on, we have over 10,000 homes in the pipeline committed to getting certified. We’ve also picked up some leading large production builders. Meritage is getting ready to move into large subdivisions. The numbers aren’t really what they were with ENERGY STAR but all the signs are very positive. We are up against a major set of challenges to get this program off the ground.
What are those challenges?
Resources. We have one-sixth the resources to do this program as the ENERGY STAR program has. They have 12-14 people. We have about two and a half people. For a national program, that’s incredibly small.
The setting is completely changed. The number of diverse business options for builders to label their homes is so extensive. There’s a whole array of green labels, including ENERGY STAR and the RESNET Energy Smart Builders label. While ENERGY STAR was able to be a dominant label in the marketplace, we are fighting for our label’s recognition.
We launched our program right on the heels of the Great Recession. It was very difficult to attract builders who were definitely in shock from the downturn. Coming at them with new requirements at that time was definitely more of a challenge than we ever had with ENERGY STAR.
Very significantly, we didn’t have any dedicated salesforce. ENERGY STAR hitched its wagon to the then nascent HERS (Home Energy Rating System) verification process, which did take hold and got most of its revenue (80-90%) from the ENERGY STAR-certified program. With ZERH, we are fighting to get the raters’ attention.
 There’s an amazing number of different voices on “zero”. We’re working hard to get a common agenda so that zero doesn’t go the way of “green” with too many different meanings and thresholds. We’re working to corral the disparate voices.
Which building features most distinguish ZERH from ENERGY STAR?
There are three major differences. One, we require builders to go to the next-generation code, while ENERGY STAR is pegged to the current code. Second, on the comfort side, we require that ducts be inside conditioned space, and we require dehumidification solutions in hot, humid climates. Those are two insane things not to have in a new home. One of the reasons I jumped to the ZERH home program was to get some of the poor practices that you can still do with ENERGY STAR off the table. Third, we make indoor air quality mandatory. You have to do the full indoor air-plus package for zero-energy-ready homes.
To spur ZERH’s success, which specific marketing messages do you recommend?
We're really focused on one key simple concept that consumers can understand very quickly: This is a superior home experience. There are seven experiences that show that.
Tens of thousands of dollar savings over a 30-year mortgage and often more than $100,000 in savings.
Full thermal protection from the hottest and coldest weather.
Total comfort taken to a whole new level because of these additional requirements.
Healthy living so every day your family breathes better and that’s because of the indoor air package.
Peace of mind from not having to worry about any moisture issues in your home and that’s because of a comprehensive water protection system.
Certified performance because of independent verification, testing, and diagnostics to the most rigorous federal guidelines for a high-performance home.
Enhanced value because you’re buying a home that meets and exceeds future expectations.
Once you’re in your home and you've passed some of the initial infatuation with a new house, all these experiences are amazingly important.

India’s new scorecard shows states are stepping ahead on energy efficiency;"In India last week, ACEEE’s sister organization released the first-ever scorecard to track the energy efficiency efforts of India’s 29 states and capital, Delhi – a step forward for the country.
India has one of the world’s fastest growing economies. This growth makes energy efficiency necessary for balancing energy demand and supply, keeping power system capital requirements affordable, and expanding electricity access to all villages. In ACEEE’s recent International Energy Efficiency Scorecard, India ranked 15th out of 25 major economies, indicating substantial room for improvement.
While India’s central government has often led on efficiency initiatives, it has encouraged Indian states to get more involved in recent years. On August 1, our sister organization, the India-based Alliance for an Energy-Efficient Economy (AEEE), released the State Energy Efficiency Index.
This Index, based loosely on ACEEE’s State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, rates all 30 Indian states and territories in six areas – buildings, industry, municipalities, transport, agriculture/distribution companies, and cross sector. It has four goals: (1) help drive state and local energy efficiency policies and program implementation; (2) highlight best practices and encourage healthy competition among states; (3) track progress in managing India’s energy footprint; and (4) set a baseline for efficiency efforts and state-specific targets.
The Index gathers data from each state, assigns a total of 100 points to 63 metrics, and groups states into four categories: front-runner, achiever, contender, and aspirant. The five states earning front-runner status include Kerala (on the southwest coast), Rajasthan (home of Jaipur), Andhra Pradesh (south-central India, just south of Hyderabad), Maharashtra (home of Mumbai), and Punjab (in the north bordering Pakistan) (see illustration below). Each of these states has gross state product per capita above the Indian average.
India’s State Energy Efficiency Index
AEEE worked closely with ACEEE and two Indian government agencies, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency and Niti Aayog, to develop the Index. AEEE plans to revise it annually and offer technical, policy, and implementation assistance to states so they can improve their scores, just as ACEEE does with its State Scorecard. 
The State Energy Efficiency Index is part of a multi-year collaboration between ACEEE and AEEE. Other elements of the collaboration are a biennial energy efficiency conference called INSPIRE, work on managing India’s sharply rising cooling demand in a sustainable fashion, and work on super-efficient appliances for India.
India is not the only country interested in state energy efficiency scorecards. ACEEE is currently assisting Efficiency Canada with the first Canadian provincial scorecard and has also discussed state scorecards with organizations in Australia, China, and Japan.

Equity in energy efficiency: Summer Study speakers discuss topic;"In our new Rural Energy Burden report, we find that low-income residents spend a much bigger share of their income on energy bills than other Americans. ACEEE has increasingly focused on this “energy burden” in recent years, because we want to make energy affordable for everyone. At our Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings next month, we will devote an entire panel to equity.
                                             
Register today – Availability is limited
      We will also hold a plenary session on the topic, and I’m pleased that the speaker will be Colette Pichon Battle, executive director of the Gulf Coast Center for Law and Policy. She has done a lot of work to highlight the need for equity in energy efficiency, prompted partly by watching Gulf recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.
“I saw whole cities being ‘re-conceptualized,’ planning being done for a new New Orleans, a new Gulf Coast,” she told me in a pre-Summer Study interview. “Too many times, I’m sad to say, those plans for a new and better  tomorrow were made without the voices of people who had just experienced catastrophic events. And when  communities were brought in, it was generally to  affirm what others had generated without them.”
But for equity to be true, Battle said, “it has to be at the core of a planning process. And those most marginalized have to be included in the conceptualization, not just affirmation of the plan.”  
Summer Study’s Panel 13, “Energy Efficiency and Equity: Addressing the Underserved,” will explore ways to incorporate the issue into program planning. Speakers will look at programs in several states, including Illinois and Pennsylvania, and rural areas. They will discuss inclusive financing, workforce development, healthy home benefits, solar integration, and utility rate design.     
The panel will also highlight those most adversely affected by high energy bills. Chip Berry, lead survey statistician at the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), will provide a snapshot in his presentation, “Who’s Energy Insecure?
You Might Be Surprised.” EIA’s analysis is based on the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, which asked participants whether they faced challenges in paying energy bills or keeping their home at a livable temperature.   
“If they answered that they experienced any of these situations, even if only for a short time period, they were classified as energy insecure,” Berry said in an ACEEE interview, noting that 31% of surveyed US households met this definition. “Reducing or foregoing basic necessities, such as food and medicine, in order to pay an energy bill was the most commonly reported challenge (21%), followed by receiving a disconnect or non-delivery notice (14%). Less commonly reported were loss of heating (5%) or air-conditioning (6%) due to financial hardship.”
EIA found energy insecurity occurred most often among households that are larger, low-income (less than $20,000 annually), black or African-American, or Hispanic. It was also most common among residents of older homes, mobile homes, and small apartment buildings (2-4 units). Only 6% of households reported receiving financial assistance to help pay energy bills or fix broken heating or cooling equipment.

Rollback of fuel efficiency standards would cost consumers billions;"Statement by Therese Langer, ACEEE Transportation Program Director
The Trump administration’s plan to roll back clean car standards will force Americans to pay more at the gas pump and increase air pollution that harms our health and the environment. 
By hitting the brakes on corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas emissions standards before model year 2021, the administration would cause the owner of an average model year 2025 vehicle to fill up the gas tank 66 more times and drive up the cost of ownership by $1,620 over the life of the vehicle. By 2035, the rollback would add at least 158 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to our air annually and increase US fuel consumption by 13.9 billion gallons per year — more than we import each year from Iraq or Venezuela. That is the equivalent of having more than 39 million additional cars on the road.
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and US Department of Transportation’s (DOT) worse-than-expected plan flies in the face of science, years of research and technical analysis —and common sense. In addition to saving Americans money at the pump, creating jobs, and protecting our health and the environment, the standards help to ensure the continued health of the domestic auto industry in a global market moving toward greener vehicles. EPA and DOT are slamming on the brakes even though their engineers previously identified cost-effective technologies available to deliver gains over 25% beyond 2020 levels. And DOT has gone so far as to argue that the United States no longer has a compelling need to conserve fuel. Perhaps most preposterous of all is the agencies’ projection that their rollback will save thousands of lives by reducing the amount that people drive.
Taking this ill-advised plan one step further, EPA also proposes to revoke the Clean Air Act waiver it issued allowing California and 13 other states to maintain stronger standards. In addition, DOT asserts that CAFE standards preempt those state programs. But states looking to develop a path forward should not be held back by a federal government that has lost its way on fuel efficiency advances and emissions reductions.
Maintaining progress on fuel economy and tailpipe emissions is essential to meeting long-term economic and environmental goals in the United States. The Trump administration should focus on facilitating that progress rather than rolling back clean car standards that benefit American consumers, automakers, and the environment.

New programs nudge homeowners to switch to electric heat pumps;"From coast to coast, several programs are starting to help homeowners switch from space and water heating fueled by oil, propane, and natural gas to high-efficiency heat pumps powered by clean electricity. Multiple studies have found such conversions will be necessary to achieve deep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions (see here and here), while also saving energy and money for customers. Our recent ACEEE report profiled a few programs, primarily in California and the Northeast, that are promoting electrification and often combining equipment incentives with other energy efficiency measures.
Leadership from California
Perhaps the most aggressive program is operated by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), a municipal utility serving Sacramento, CA. SMUD recently started a program that offers a $2,500 rebate for replacing a gas furnace with a heat pump (and also sealing ducts and installing a smart thermostat), a $3,000 rebate for replacing a gas water heater with a heat pump water heater, and an additional $2,500 for taking specified steps to move toward becoming an efficient all-electric home.  Additional information is available here. Because this program is new, results are not available yet. SMUD is also planning to give rebates for new all-electric homes and is considering a smaller rebate for homes that are electric ready, meaning they have adequate electric service, breakers, wiring, and plugs to be easily converted to all electric, even if some gas appliances are installed at the time of construction.
Cold-climate heat pumps in the Northeast
Initial results are available for programs promoting cold-climate heat pumps in Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont. Efficiency Maine, the state’s primary efficiency program administrator, is leading a ductless heat pump program for residential and commercial customers. For example, residential customers can receive a $500 rebate for the first indoor unit and $250 for a second one. Since 2011, more than 25,000 units have been installed through the program. Administrators attribute the high adoption rate to the large cost savings from switching from oil to high-efficiency electric heat pumps, particularly during years of high oil prices. The high rebate amounts have also encouraged a substantial number of customers to adopt the technology.
Massachusetts views electrification as a strategy to meet its grid flexibility and grid modernization goals. The state has two heat pump programs: Mass Save (operated by the state’s utilities) and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Council (MassCEC) Clean Heating and Cooling program (operated by the state). Both programs offer incentives for ductless and ducted heat pumps that meet specified efficiency criteria. In the utility program, incentives are higher for higher efficiency levels. In the state program, higher incentives are available for low-income households. Customers can combine Mass Save and MassCEC rebates. Both programs have had successful starts – the MassCEC program has incentivized more than 9,000 units since it began in 2015, and Mass Save incentivized about 9,000 heat pumps in 2016 alone.
Vermont’s 2016 Comprehensive Energy Plan identifies heat pumps as a strategy for meeting its goals for reducing fossil fuel consumption. Efficiency Vermont (a statewide “efficiency utility”) launched a ductless heat pump program in 2014 that provides a $600–800 per unit midstream incentive to wholesale distributors, and distributors are required to pass the savings to contractors through an instant discount. Customers can also receive incentives from their electric utilities, which are driven in part by a state requirement to help customers reduce fossil fuel use.  Homeowners can also rent a ductless heat pump through the program. Monthly rates range from $41.99 to $54.99 depending on the equipment size; agreements run for 15 years. Installation, materials, and maintenance are built into the flat monthly fee. To date, the program has incentivized more than 8,200 heat pumps, including more than 1,000 leased units. Efficiency Vermont attributes this success largely to the sizable upstream incentives, made possible by using both electric savings and fossil fuel savings in its cost-benefit calculation. These large incentives, paired with strong supply chain engagement, have driven participation.
Additional information on these programs, as well as other programs in Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island, and the Pacific Northwest can be found in our recent report.
These programs can increase the market share of high-efficiency heat pumps in attractive applications, and they can also highlight what does and doesn’t work in terms of both technologies and programs.

Just how smart can our buildings and grid be? Summer Study panel leader offers insights;"From advanced data analytics and cybersecurity to artificial intelligence and blockchain, technology offers sweeping opportunities — and challenges — for energy efficiency. At our Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings next month, we will discuss these topics in a Monday plenary, sessions throughout the conference, and a tech-focused panel with more than two dozen speakers.
Register today - last day to avoid late fees!
Our “Smart Buildings, Smart Grid, and the Internet of Things (loT)” panel will extensively cover the space that ACEEE calls intelligent efficiency. For example, its speakers will explore smart home technologies, including window shades, HVAC and ventilation, and the cybersecurity implications of smart outlets. They will look at sub-metering loT, leveraging data to overcome skepticism that energy savings are real, and integrating connected loads to provide grid balancing.
Those are just a few highlights from Panel 12. To get a sneak peak, we discussed the topics and the sessions with panel co-chair Jessica Granderson, staff scientist in the Building Technology and Urban Systems Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Here are excerpts of our conversation with Granderson, who will also co-chair our next Summer Study Buildings in 2020.
Which topics on your panel interest you most and why?
Topics surrounding advanced controls and analytics. We're seeing increased prevalence of effective solutions that can materially impact smart buildings and grid interaction, and those solutions span today's products and services, as well as emerging techniques from the R&D community.   
You will moderate a session that looks at blockchain. How significant a role might it play in energy efficiency?
Well, I think that's one question that we are all trying to figure out! Our Tuesday session will share two presenters' experiences and perspectives on where the benefits may and how they can be realized. 
Your panel also explores smart outlets and thermostats. What risks might they pose to privacy and cybersecurity?
These devices collect information on resolved space occupancy and device usage, entailing details about individual or family preferences, behaviors, and habits. As we have seen, most recently in the social networking context, such information can potentially be used for far different purposes than the user intends or is perhaps aware of. Along with this, the connected nature of these systems opens risks surrounding cybersecurity and raises questions about whether sufficient protections are put in place and maintained.
What are the biggest challenges ahead for smart buildings and a smart grid?
Connectivity and integration are enormous, multifaceted challenges that we are grappling with. Data and communications integration, control integration across end uses and devices, services integration ... we could go on. Each of these presents tremendous opportunity for advances in smart buildings and smart gird.
Which smart features will most buildings have in 10 years that they don’t have now?
Assuming that we see more rapid advances in the next 10 years than we did in the past 10 years, we might see features such as location, time, and space resolved occupancy sensing, which can support more aggressive ""sleep mode"" operation and building- and occupant-customized space conditioning. As distributed energy resources come on line, with increased granularity and intelligence in sensing and actuation, end use controls may be co-optimized across energy, demand, cost, and comfort. Continuous monitoring and performance analysis technology combined with a rich ecosystem of service providers could make efficiency a procurable building feature in the operational phase of the lifecycle.

Will Trump’s DOE soon propose to roll back light bulb standards? Here’s what’s at stake;"The Trump administration will soon release a proposed rule on light bulb standards. The details are under wraps, but manufacturers have lobbied for an illegal rollback of strong standards with which they must comply beginning in 2020. Our new issue brief shows what’s at stake.
Few energy efficiency success stories are bigger than the national light bulb standards. Enacted by the US Congress and President Bush in 2007, they are delivering huge savings for consumers and the environment. They helped spur the investments and market changes that have resulted in the low-cost, high-quality LEDs (light emitting diodes) that are now widely available.
Initial standards, which we refer to as stage 1, started taking effect in 2012. Last year, the US Department of Energy (DOE) widened the range of light bulbs that must comply with tougher standards (stage 2), slated for 2020. These 2020 standards will expand the LED market and further reduce costs for consumers, ensuring affordable LEDs will be widely available for all types of bulbs commonly used in US homes.
We estimate that US light bulb standards will save consumers more than $5 billion on electricity bills this year alone. After 2020, when manufacturers and retailers must comply with stage 2, annual consumer bill savings will grow, reaching about $22 billion in 2025 (about $180 for an average household). Total electricity savings will top 140 billion kilowatt hours in 2025 —approximately the amount generated by 45 large coal-fired power plants or 25,000 wind turbines in a year. By reducing the amount of fuel burned for electricity, the standards cut harmful emissions such as smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and globe-warming carbon dioxide (CO2). The result? Cleaner air and fewer respiratory problems such as childhood asthma attacks.
The broader economy also benefits. In a report released last week, ACEEE and ASAP estimate that the light bulb standards will create or sustain 115,000 additional US jobs in 2025.
But the rollback sought by manufacturers would potentially eliminate all savings from the 2020 standards, slowing the transition to energy-efficient lighting and hurting consumers and the economy. The average household would lose $115 per year in electricity bill savings in 2025, the portion delivered by the stage 2 standards. As the figure below shows, on a national, cumulative basis, consumers would lose more than $340 billion in bill savings by 2050. Millions of tons of pollutants would be needlessly added to the atmosphere.
Whether a rollback attempt succeeds will likely depend on a set of legal issues. The law triggered an automatic “backstop” standard for stage 2 when DOE failed to comply with legal deadlines. In addition, DOE’s likely inability to meet the minimum savings threshold set by Congress will also trigger the automatic stage 2 standards. But manufacturers see it differently, arguing that the backstop standard has not been triggered. In the soon-to-be-released proposed rule, we will learn what the Trump administration plans.
Because the national appliance standards law forbids a weakening of the standards, either by lowering them or narrowing the range of products covered, any attempt to roll back the 2020 standards will almost assuredly lead to lawsuits. The law also permits states to step in to enforce these standards. With such enormous energy and economic benefits at stake, the effort to protect the 2020 standards will be a top priority.

Pickups gearing up for huge fuel economy improvements;"Automakers are rolling out an impressive suite of fuel-saving technologies just as the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seek to roll back vehicle efficiency and emissions standards. Many of these technologies will be applied to full-size pickups, the perennial poster child for going easy on domestic manufacturers when it comes to setting future fuel economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) standards. Let’s take a look at how the Detroit Three’s pickups might fare relative to the standards already on the books — starting with an unexpected rising star.
RAM’s big fuel economy play
RAM’s parent company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCA), is a persistent fuel economy laggard. According to DOT fuel economy projections, FCA’s model year 2018 overall average fuel economy is projected to fall short of its standard by a full 3.4 miles per gallon (MPG). But by embracing cutting-edge technologies, the automaker’s RAM pickup line looks poised to become an efficiency trailblazer.
RAM is the first domestic automaker to offer a 48-volt mild hybrid system, making it a standard feature on the entry-level V6 engine and an option on its V8. Mild hybrids use a relatively small battery and belt-driven motor-generator, making the system simpler and cheaper than a traditional hybrid. Mild hybrids boost fuel economy (more than 2 MPG on the V8) while providing additional torque, a perk most pickup buyers are bound to appreciate.  Because mild hybrids avoid the cost and complexity of a traditional hybrid, these systems could become standard equipment in many more vehicles down the road. The 2019 RAM includes other notable technology such as active aerodynamics that further improve fuel economy. Aerodynamics alone will contribute a fuel economy improvement of one full MPG.
So far, only a few of the 2019 models have been EPA certified, so to project how far these new trucks will go on a gallon of gas, we turn to estimates provided by the manufacturers or their parts suppliers, along with a healthy dose of engineering judgment. To see how these trucks might fare, we estimated fuel economy for one of the most popular configurations – a crew cab with standard 5’7” box for each available RAM engine.  
When equipped with the base mild hybrid V6, the 2019 RAM will far exceed its 2019 laboratory fuel economy target of 25.3 MPG – equivalent to about 20.2 MPG in real-world driving. Moreover, taking into account various technology credits available under the CAFE program, which can substantially facilitate manufacturer compliance and are widely used by the industry, the truck could exceed its targets for the next several years – through model year 2023 by our estimates (figure 1). That’s right – despite claims by automakers and the current administration that future fuel economy standards are too hard, by the end of this year you’ll be able to buy a popular, no-compromise, domestic pickup that meets its future fuel economy target four years early. Plus, the truck has more power and greater towing and payload capabilities than the one it replaces. The same is true of other RAM models.
ACEEE estimates of Model Year 2019 RAM 1500 certification fuel economy
Crew Cab with standard (5’7”) bed; I4 Turbo mild hybrid is speculative with no manufacturer statement of availability
FCA will offer a diesel option in the 2019 RAM with a boost in MPG. The VW emissions cheating scandal has had major repercussions for diesel — including an EPA civil complaint that the RAM 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee diesels contained illegal “defeat devices” in model years 2014-2016. EPA gave FCA the go-ahead to sell diesels again starting in model year 2017, however. We estimate that 2019 diesel RAM trucks, regardless of cab style or two- or four-wheel-drive, will exceed their model year 2025 fuel economy target by nearly half a mile per gallon.
Plus, we’re betting that RAM will eventually adopt the new 2.0-liter inline four (I4) cylinder turbocharged mild hybrid engine that Jeep debuted on its redesigned 2018 Wrangler. The engine is even more powerful and more efficient than the outgoing RAM’s standard V6. We estimate that a RAM truck equipped with this turbocharged I4 would easily surpass its model year 2025 fuel economy target of 32.1 MPG (about 25.7 MPG in real-world driving). Though RAM will offer its less-efficient V8 both with and without the mild hybrid option in 2019, we suspect consumers will prefer the more-efficient powertrain options, much as they did in the case of Ford’s EcoBoost F-150 engines.
A race for fuel efficiency dominance
As RAM fuel economy takes off, its competitors won’t sit idle. GM and Ford are also gearing up for hybrid powertrains on their pickups. GM is already selling its optional mild hybrid eAssist system with the 5.3-liter V8, contributing to a 12% improvement in fuel economy, while Ford has teased a full hybrid F-150 by 2020. Both manufacturers will offer a diesel powertrain option within the next year or two, promising an EPA-rated highway fuel economy of at least 30 MPG in certain configurations. Ford also recently updated the Ecoboost engine for 2018 that helped to increase F-150 fuel economy by up to 2 MPG – more than enough to meet increasingly stringent fuel economy targets in the near term.
GM has completely redesigned its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size trucks for 2019, and our preliminary analysis shows that GM is a serious contender in the emerging pickup fuel economy battle. Some of the best-selling trims will come standard with the first turbocharged I4 in the segment, which will significantly improve fuel economy while also offering more power and torque than the 4.3-liter V6 it replaces.
Where does that leave us?
Despite complaints that vehicle standards are too tough, manufacturers are proving that their most utility-driven and most-profitable products, sold to their most-demanding customers, can meet those very standards years early. Innovative engine improvements, combined with other fuel-saving technologies such as lightweight materials, leave little doubt that a big – if not historic – jump in pickup fuel economy is coming over the next few years. The new technologies won’t be free, but most buyers ultimately will more than offset those costs by spending less at the pump. Pickup buyers have a lot to look forward to – largely thanks to effective fuel economy standards.

Universities push to slash energy use: Summer Study speaker describes how;"Across the United States, the push for net-zero energy buildings is gaining momentum. Because this trend holds great promise for deep energy savings, next month’s Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings will devote an entire panel — with 30 presentations — to the topic.
Register by July 31 to avoid late fees
As part of the “Zero Energy – Moving Beyond 1%” Panel 10, speakers will explore cutting-edge efforts to build homes, affordable housing, schools, and communities that use as little energy as possible by incorporating efficiency measures and renewable power generation. College campuses are showing leadership in this area, and to further their impact ACEEE launched the Shrink Your Dorm Print campaign last summer to help students save energy.   
To learn more about campus efforts, I reached out to Otto Van Geet, one of our Summer Study speakers. He’s principal engineer in the Integrated Applications Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which has tools to help universities develop and implement their energy-reduction plans. He’s also lead author of the paper, “Zero Energy University Campuses: A 2018 Progress Update on Reaching Campus Energy Goals.” In our conversation, excerpted below, Van Geet gives highlights of the paper that he will present at Summer Study.
Your paper says universities are aggressively seeking to cut energy waste. How many are taking action?
As of early 2018, more than 650 institutions from all 50 states have signed up for the American College & University Presidents’ Climate Commitment, launched in 2007. Several have pledged climate goals for their entire university system. For example, the University of California has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2025 (buildings and vehicle fleet). One of the most rigorous sustainability ratings is the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS). By June 2018, more than 900 institutions had registered to use STARS.
Which approaches seem to be working best and why?
As we lay out in this paper, a long-term goal commitment with year-to-year specific action plans and commitments works well.
You talk about combined heat and power (CHP) systems. How are universities adopting them?
Many universities have CHP and a few more are considering it. CHP can also provide resilience in the form of electricity (and heat) in the event of a grid outage if the CHP system and electric infrastructure are designed to island from the grid. Many universities have CHP systems that use natural gas as a fuel. If a university has a zero-carbon goal and CHP, the fuel must be zero carbon, such as biomethane, biodiesel, or hydrogen generated from zero-carbon energy sources. Because of zero-carbon goals, some universities are removing their legacy CHP systems. In 2015, Stanford removed its existing CHP central plant and added a district electric heat pump heat recovery central plant with thermal energy storage, 5 MW of on-site photovoltaic (PV), and 68 MW of off-site PV. This system has been a key to reaching more than 50% campus-wide renewable electricity.
What are your four design principles for new zero-energy buildings and campus retrofits?
Maximize building efficiency in new construction and major renovation
Maximize solar potential
Maximize renewable thermal energy
Maximize load control
What’s the most important thing for universities to consider when trying to save energy?
Focus on laboratory building energy use. A typical laboratory is three to four times more energy intensive than an average commercial building, and laboratories can account for up to 70% of a campus’s energy footprint. When the University of California Irvine (UCI) set a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025, it discovered that lab buildings were approximately 20% of the campus building area but consumed 65% of the energy on the UCI campus. UCI began the Smart Labs Initiative and was able to reduce the energy use of 10 lab buildings by an average of 60% by implementing Smart Labs strategies. DOE initiated the Better Buildings Smart Lab Accelerator (BBSLA) based largely on the UCI Smart Labs. The BBSLA works with partners that commit to reducing energy use in labs by at least 20% over the next 10 years.
Looking 10 years into the future, how much progress will universities likely make and what might it look like?
All will have large on-site PV systems and significant off-site PV and wind procurement methods. All new buildings will be zero energy and/or zero energy ready, and they will be making meaningful progress toward reaching their campus climate and energy goals.

How can technology reshape energy efficiency? Summer Study speakers offer insights;"A dizzying array of cutting-edge energy efficiency technology is available in today’s marketplace. Though many smart products are affordable, they remain vastly underutilized. The efficiency field seems to have a persistent and stubborn adoption gap. To explore the issue, ACEEE’s Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings will hold a tech-focused plenary in addition to dozens of related sessions.
Register by August 1 to avoid late fees
As Summer Study’s 2018 co-chair, I helped organize and will moderate the tech plenary on Monday, August 13th, entitled “Making Efficiency Easy and Enticing — Does Technology Help or Hurt?” To give you a taste of our discussion, I posed a few questions to the plenary’s speakers: Emma Bassein, VP of Strategic Initiatives at Carbon Lighthouse; Fatima Crerar, Director of Social Impact and Sustainability at ecobee; Colin Sng, Director of Customer Success at First Fuel; and Yeye Zhang, head of West Region Energy Partnerships at Google.
  Emma Bassein,  Fatima Crerar, Colin Sng, Yeye Zhang
Here are excerpts of our conversation:
Which energy efficiency technologies available today hold the most promise for saving energy?
Emma: In general, we see that controls, both in lighting and HVAC, hold the most promise. The real challenge is getting them to work well and together. There are also some really interesting products coming out pushing the boundaries of equipment efficiency, from frictionless compressors to advanced materials impacting everything from the efficiency of heat exchangers to building facades.
Yeye: Smart thermostats!!!
What do you see as the biggest barriers to their mass adoption?
Emma: The biggest barrier is getting the attention of the right decision makers. There is a compelling case that these energy efficiency improvements on their own have much more significant financial implications when you look at how an increase in operating income impacts the value of a commercial building. Some technologies, such as lighting with integrated sensors that can create virtual lighting zones, have the opportunity for ancillary benefits such as not needing to re-wire lighting circuits when the use of the space changes. This could have huge upside on the tenant improvement process.
Colin: Achieving mass adoption of EE technologies is multi-faceted. I think a big part is about better understanding the mindset of the consumers or end-customers we're trying to reach. If we use the Technology Adoption Curve as a guide, mass adoption would be the stage at which one should be appealing to the practical, risk-minimization mindset of the (early) majority rather than early adopters and innovators. A few of the main challenges in reaching this ""majority"" group are: (1) being able to relate benefits in the context of personal or business goals, (2) improving the ease of deciding on and implementing the technology, and (3) helping them make sense of the cost of implementing a technology or, more specifically, the return on investment.
Yeye: Lack of awareness and the if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it mindset. Replacing a (dumb) thermostat that's still functioning, even if it's not saving energy or money takes a lot of consideration. And smart thermostats are a considered purchase. 
How can we address those barriers and make efficiency easy and enticing?
Emma: In short: we need to take a data-driven approach to clean energy and efficiency. At Carbon Lighthouse, we employ data to completely change the way that we talk about the economic value of energy savings. We look at how it really impacts the individual commercial building’s financial metrics and think beyond just one building to strategies that are scalable to portfolios. On the technical side… we take a totally technology agnostic approach and use a vast dataset to customize solutions to specific buildings in an automated way and then make sure those solutions are implemented correctly and last in the long term by both managing the installation on the ground and then trending the results over time to detect anomalies.
Colin: Being able to personalize the outreach, the messaging, and the offer goes a long way toward building awareness and credibility with each customer…To achieve mass adoption, personalization needs to happen at scale. And that is where analytics and automation come in. Customer-specific insights driven by real-time analytics enable the effective use of personalization at each step of the consumer's/end-customer's journey, and not just in recommending a specific technology.
Yeye: 1. Focus on the customer, remove friction from the experience, and meet customers where they are: in retail, online, with trades or pros, and through utility programs. For example, validated instant rebates, both in brick and mortar stores and online, have significantly influenced customers to purchase these new technologies. 2. Expand access to energy savings technologies to income-qualified customers, multi-residential properties, small and medium businesses, and other harder-to-reach sectors. 3. Collaborate with brands to delight the customer! It's not just a smart thermostat, it's the thoughtful home. 
Are the “non-energy” features of technologies the key to increasing their adoption?
Emma: The tough part about non-energy features is that they each appeal to different players in the building ecosystem. If you are selling financial benefits to the owner, they will not be directly affected by improved indoor air quality in that building, nor with how much easier it might be to reconfigure a space with virtual lighting zones. If the primary customer for a given service or technology is property management, a different set of priorities might surface that highlights some of the other benefits, and yet a different set of priorities for a facility chief. For example, they might not care about the cost savings at all, but do care about reduced comfort complaints or equipment downtime. 
Yeye: Absolutely. Convenience is queen! 
From a technology perspective, what can we do to make efficiency easy and enticing? Can technology be used effectively to ease consumer choices and corporate decision-making? Or is technology in fact getting in the way?  Are the “non-energy” features of technologies the key to increasing their adoption?
We will explore these questions and more in a spirited free-flowing discussion in this plenary session. We hope you will attend and join the discussion!

Appliance standards create jobs — in every US state;"National standards that require appliances and equipment to be more energy efficient do more than save energy and reduce utility bills. They also spur economic growth and create jobs — a lot of jobs. In fact, our new report reveals that they created or sustained nearly 300,000 jobs in 2016 and are projected to support 553,000 jobs in 2030. These jobs benefit every US state.
Here’s how: When consumers and businesses take the money they have saved on energy and water bills and spend it in other sectors of the economy, it boosts growth and jobs in those other sectors. Because the energy sector is among the least job-intensive parts of the US economy, this spending shift results in net employment gains. 
These gains are sizable, because existing standards have been a huge success story. The US Department of Energy estimates they will save 71 quadrillion Btus (quads) of energy by 2020 and double that by 2030, when they will cumulatively save more than $2 trillion in utility bills. Savings on water and wastewater bills will also accrue. National standards cover approximately 60 categories of products, ranging from appliances such as refrigerators and microwave ovens in homes to cooling/heating equipment and lighting in offices and other commercial buildings.
Our research quantifies the jobs that result from the standards’ net economic savings, which totaled $58 billion in 2016 and will reach $134 billion by 2030. The half million-plus jobs we expect in 2030 are almost as many as the roughly 650,000 in the entire US mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector.
Standards for light bulbs contribute to this positive macroeconomic impact more than any other standard. The stronger light bulb standards slated to take effect in 2020 account for nearly one-fifth of the net economic benefits and jobs in 2030. Unfortunately, the Trump administration may soon attempt an illegal rollback, which could put those savings and jobs at risk.
The number of jobs created or sustained by appliance and equipment standards is significant in every state. For example, in 2030 California’s net economic benefits will total nearly $20 billion, resulting in more than 80,000 jobs. Savings scale with population and commercial building energy use so, not surprisingly, the states will the biggest populations have the largest job growth. Yet not just the largest states benefit. In Kentucky, appliance standards will produce $1.4 billion in net economic benefits and create or support more than 5,500 jobs in 2030.
Appliance standards are an obvious boon to energy, water, and monetary savings, but they are also a major job creator. As technologies improve, there will be new opportunities to update standards, increasing both savings and jobs. Weakening or eliminating current standards will harm the economy and put jobs at risk.

How can we unite people when talking about energy? Summer Study speaker explains;"Words matter. Using the right ones can bring people together, while choosing the wrong ones (e.g., you’re actually smart) can get you in trouble. For this reason, I am pleased that our Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings next month will explore a broad range of topics, including energy messaging that can unite rather than divide us.
Register by July 31st to avoid late fees
  One of our speakers will be Suzanne Shelton, president and CEO of the Shelton Group, a marketing communication agency that focuses exclusively on the energy and environment sectors. She will describe the results of her 2017 study, which surveyed 2,000 people and focused on the sustainability terms that all Americans can agree on, regardless of political affiliation. I caught up with Suzanne to get a sneak peek of her presentation, entitled “Multiple Americas: Are there messaging strategies that can bridge the divide?” I hope you join us at Summer Study to see Suzanne’s full presentation and those of our other 350-plus speakers on dozens of topics.
Here are excerpts of our conversation:
You tested words to see which ones could best unite or divide us. Which ones unite and why?
What we measured was the degree of positive or negative reaction people had to various words and phrases. We call those that elicited more positive reactions words that “unite,” meaning most people won’t get turned off from listening to you when you use them. We found that “science,” “conservation,” and “sustainability” all ranked high on the positive end of the scale. All three resonate across demographics, political ideologies, and worldviews.
Which words are most divisive and why?
“Environmental stewardship,” “regulation,” and “carbon footprint.” We classified these three as divisive not because they elicited the most negative reactions, but because responses were more evenly split. The “why” is not quite as clear here. Our previous research indicates that many people don’t have a clear understanding of what “carbon footprint” means and have different interpretations of “environmental stewardship.” As for “regulation,” people may accept rules and regulations as necessary, but we shouldn’t confuse that acceptance with positive feelings toward them.
To tap common beliefs and also bridge our differences, how should we talk about energy and sustainability?
First, we need to understand that there really is common ground when it comes to the environment and how Americans think about it. To reach the broadest possible audience, we need to speak using terms we know they understand and that reflect their shared values and beliefs. Then we need to help them connect the dots between those beliefs and the actions we want them to take. At the same time, we need to be careful to not use words they don’t understand or are overly subject to interpretation, and above all, avoid terms that may polarize them and create a longer, harder walk between their beliefs and positive actions.

EPA gives glider manufacturers a free pass at the expense of the American public;"Just hours before Administrator Scott Pruitt’s departure on Friday, the US Environmental Protection Agency reportedly widened a loophole for manufacturers of high-polluting glider trucks — new tractor trucks with old engines. Starting immediately, the EPA will not enforce a per-manufacturer annual production cap of 300 gliders that do not meet current emissions standards. Although the cap went into effect at the beginning of this year, the EPA plans to ignore and eventually repeal it. This loophole will help glider companies like Fitzgerald Glider Kits, which produced 3,000 glider trucks in 2017, but at a steep cost to the American public.
These zombie trucks will typically be far less fuel-efficient than new trucks, not only because the efficiency of new engines has increased by more than 10% in recent years, but also because they will not be subject to the whole-truck fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards that have been in effect since 2014. Moreover, gliders mostly use pre-2002 engines, which are not equipped with aftertreatment technologies. This means enormously higher emissions: according to the EPA, these older engines typically emit 20-40 times more nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions than today’s new diesel engines. With more glider trucks on the road, higher levels of pollutants in the air will contribute to negative health impacts such as asthma attacks and other respiratory problems.
How did this all come about, you ask? Fitzgerald Glider Kits petitioned the EPA to drop gliders from the standards. It cited woefully deficient research that Pruitt’s EPA then dutifully referenced in a repeal proposal, which has been stalled in regulatory limbo but may resurface at any time. That research, funded by Fitzgerald, was conducted by Tennessee Technological University, which has since disowned the study. And this is not the only example of the EPA kowtowing to the industry, either.
The EPA’s failure to distinguish scientific analysis from industry claptrap has played out in the arena of light-duty vehicle standards as well. In April, the EPA declared greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards for cars and light trucks “not appropriate,” despite the fact that the Obama administration put those standards in place following years of high-quality technical analysis, vehicle testing, vehicle tear-downs, and public engagement. The EPA has yet to publish any new analysis on the subject but is expected to formally propose a rollback of the standards jointly with the US Department of Transportation in the coming weeks. In an encouraging departure from the rampant disregard for science overtaking Washington, the EPA’s Science Advisory Board recently voted to review the agency’s efforts to roll back light-duty vehicle and glider standards after one of its working groups raised concerns with these and other EPA actions.
A proposal to repeal standards for the trailers pulled by tractor trucks could also appear at any time. These standards rely on readily available technologies such as side skirts, gap reducers, and undercarriage systems that pay for themselves within two years, and deliver an estimated 7% improvement in tractor-trailer fuel efficiency. Further improvements to trailers and their integration with tractors remain a potential source of major additional fuel savings beyond current standards, so eliminating the trailer standards would have negative repercussions beyond the current regulatory period.
Meanwhile, other jurisdictions continue to move toward improved heavy-duty vehicle fuel efficiency and emissions reductions. In February, California adopted heavy-duty GHG standards matching the original federal standards, with some limited changes. And thanks to a bill recently passed through the California State Assembly with almost unanimous support, any truck driver who drives a glider in the state may soon have to pay a $25,000 fine as well. Looking abroad, the European Commission recently proposed its first heavy-duty truck standards, which would reduce CO2 emissions 15 percent by 2025 and 30 percent by 2030, relative to 2019 levels. And Canada recently introduced new Phase II GHG emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles that would begin in model year 2021.
In granting this loophole, the EPA has sided with high-polluting special interests in the truck industry to the detriment of the health of the American public. To fulfill its mission to protect Americans’ health and the environment, the EPA must close this loophole as soon as possible and withdraw the proposed glider standards repeal that undermines US truck manufacturers and suppliers as they strive to maintain their positions as global leaders in developing fuel efficiency technologies.

Going green: Switching from oil or propane to electric heat can often save money;"To achieve the common and ambitious worldwide goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80% or more by 2050, analyses find that consumers and businesses will need to use a combination of energy efficiency and carbon-free electricity (e.g., electricity from renewable resources, nuclear) or low-carbon electricity (efficient fossil fuel use with carbon capture and storage) for transportation, space heating, and water heating (see here and here). But does electrification save money for homeowners considering making the switch? Our new study, Energy Savings, Consumer Economics, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions from Replacing Oil and Propane Furnaces, Boilers, and Water Heaters with Air-Source Heat Pumps looks at that particular question. The report finds that replacing oil and propane furnaces, boilers, and water heaters with high-efficiency electric heat pumps can often reduce total energy use and energy bills and will also reduce emissions in many cases.
Electrification can be a smart investment
When it is time to replace heating or cooling equipment, high-efficiency electric heat pumps or water heaters can often provide an attractive alternative to homeowners looking for a cost-effective solution. In fact, the energy and money saved by installing electric equipment instead of propane- or oil-powered equipment can often make up for the upfront cost in relatively short order, as shown in the following table:
  These results are for fully replacing an oil or propane system with heat pumps; partial replacements that leave the existing oil or propane system in place to provide supplementary heat are less financially attractive because the backup system will eventually need to be replaced.
This study complements a prior ACEEE study that found that switching from electric furnaces to heat pumps is often financially attractive to consumers, as is converting from electric baseboard heat to heat pumps in homes with ducts or homes with above-average space heating energy use. On the other hand, another ACEEE study found that the economics of converting gas furnaces to heat pumps are often not compelling to homeowners (e.g., simple payback periods commonly over ten years, although lower in the deep south). And work by others has identified efficient new homes as another attractive market for heat pumps.
Heat pumps are becoming more popular, but not yet plentiful
Consumer acceptance studies generally find that consumers are receptive to heat pumps, but some issues do remain, including comfort at cold temperatures, operating costs, aesthetics, noise, and reliability.
Some early programs to promote heat pumps have met substantial success and others less so. Programs in Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, and the Northwest have incentivized the purchase of thousands of heat pumps, primarily ductless heat pumps, with the market share of ductless heat pumps now at 13% in the Northwest. The most successful programs tend to provide substantial upstream incentives (to wholesalers) or midstream incentives (to contractors). They also include contractor training and certification so that systems are installed properly.
Recommendations
States interested in pursuing heat pump programs as a way to support energy savings and emissions reduction goals can take the following steps:
Offering programs to promote high-efficiency heat pumps to replace less-efficient oil and electric systems, and sometimes propane systems as well. Such efforts can build on successful programs in the Northeast and Northwest. In addition, programs to promote heat pumps in new construction deserve attention.
Training and education for contractors on proper installation and for homeowners on good applications for use of heat pumps.
More field monitoring on actual heat pump performance and refining of performance metrics based on this monitoring.
Additional research on supplemental heat for heat pump replacements in colder climates that could avoid the need to retain a fossil fuel system for supplemental heat during the coldest days.
Continued work to develop improved cold-climate electric ducted air-source heat pumps and gas-fired heat pumps.
These efforts can increase the market share of high-efficiency heat pumps in attractive applications while better learning what does and doesn’t work in terms of both technologies and programs.

Tune in to the 2018 World Cup of Energy Efficiency!;"As the world remains fixated on one of the most-anticipated sporting events of the year, ACEEE will release the results of its own World Cup. Will Germany defend its 2014 World Cup title and its 2016 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard triumph? The wait is almost over.
On Tuesday, June 26, ACEEE will unveil the results of the 2018 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard at our first-ever International Symposium. This year’s report showcases best practices for 25 of the world’s largest energy-consuming countries across 36 metrics. Together these countries represented 78% of all the energy consumed on the planet and accounted for more than 80% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) as of 2014. This year we added two new countries to the analysis — the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Ukraine — as well as a new metric on smart freight programs aimed at reducing energy consumption by streamlining a company or country’s freight operations.
Which country will win the Golden Ball (MVP award) for energy efficiency? You’ll have to wait to find out, but one thing is clear: many countries continue to show their commitment to saving energy, but they will need to make bigger plays to meet their ambitious climate goals. And things don’t look great for the United States, where the current administration has taken steps to dismantle key efficiency regulations, in addition to signaling the country’s plan to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.
Find out which countries top the list in 2018 and which fail to move on to the next round on June 26.

World Energy Rankings Suggest Countries Need Energy Efficiency to Meet Paris Goals;"Italy and Germany place first, US loses ground, Mexico improves
Washington, DC (June 26, 2018): Some countries do strikingly better than others in saving energy, but all can better use efficiency to meet their Paris Agreement climate goals, according to The 2018 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard published today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). No country came close to a perfect score, and the average remained the same as in 2016 — 51 out of a possible 100 points. Overall, Germany and Italy tie for first place this year with 75.5 points, closely followed by France (73.5), the United Kingdom (73), and Japan (67).
This fourth biennial scorecard ranks 25 of the world’s largest energy users on 36 efficiency metrics and highlights best practices countries can use to boost energy savings. For the first time, it includes the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Ukraine.
“Our results show that all countries would benefit from adopting additional energy efficiency policies,” said Steve Nadel, ACEEE’s executive director. “These policies will reduce dependence on energy imports, create jobs, cut pollution, and save people and businesses money. They will also help countries remain globally competitive and meet climate goals,” Nadel said, noting that global energy demand is projected to grow 30% by 2040.
Within sectors, Germany scored best for national efforts, including cross-cutting targets and programs. Spain nabbed the top spot for buildings-related efforts, while Japan led on industry and France on transportation.
In a troubling development, the United States slid from 8th place in 2016 to 10th in 2018 by scoring six fewer points.
“This trend is likely to persist if the current administration continues to dismantle key regulations,” said Shruti Vaidyanathan, ACEEE’s senior advisor for research. “At imminent risk are joint fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for light-duty vehicles for model years 2021 onwards, a program that put the United States at the forefront of vehicle efficiency efforts.” US Environmental Protection Agency actions are also threatening heavy-duty vehicle standards, and future improvements to existing appliance standards have ground to a halt. In addition, the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement suggests more rollbacks to come. The administration’s focus on energy production rather than efficiency has meant that progress on federal energy efficiency policies has largely stalled.
On a positive note, the most improved country this year is Mexico, which moved up from 19th place in 2016 to 12th this year by scoring 17 more points. Mexico’s recent adoption of an overarching energy efficiency program — the National Program for the Sustainable Use of Energy — has spurred significant investment in efficiency programs and standards. Additionally, Mexico sits just below the United States and Canada in the rankings this year, suggesting that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) may be playing a role in harmonizing efforts among the three member countries.   
At the bottom of this year’s rankings are Saudi Arabia and the UAE, with scores of 16.5 and 18 points, respectively. However scores for these countries in part reflect poor data availability. South Africa fills out the bottom three with a score of 23.5, nearly 10 points lower than in 2016.
Energy efficiency will need to account for almost half of all the greenhouse gas emission reductions necessary through 2040 to limit the global increase in temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, according to the International Energy Agency. To meet their climate targets and reap the multiple benefits of energy efficiency, countries should build efficiency into their economic and energy-related plans and learn from one another by emulating the best policies and practices of leading countries.

Cities are laying the foundation for a robust and equitable energy efficiency workforce;"As US cities push forward to meet their clean energy goals, they will need a strong, capable energy efficiency workforce to make critical energy-saving upgrades and investments. Our new report, Through the Local Government Lens: Developing the Energy Efficiency Workforce, shows how cities can take an active role in growing the workforce and extend its benefits to underserved communities.
The Energy Efficiency Workforce
Local governments across the United States are increasingly prioritizing energy efficiency, and there are a lot of efficiency jobs out there – 2.25 million. These jobs span diverse industries, from construction to professional and business services. And they are projected to keep multiplying, with a 9% increase predicted for 2018.
Source: ACEEE Jobs; underlying data from US Energy and Employment Report
With the right policies and practices, local governments can develop and grow this robust workforce. From our research and more than 25 interviews, we identified a few key strategies cities can take.
Collaboration is critical
Local governments can partner with stakeholders across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. For example, they can work with community colleges to identify skill gaps, state government to promote trainings and incentives, and utilities to promote existing trainings or identify new ones.
Boston, MA. City of Boston staff are actively working with both National Grid and Eversource, Boston’s gas and electric utilities, respectively, to leverage energy efficiency dollars for workforce training. Utilities will pay the tuition for facilities staff from Boston, Cambridge, and other municipalities in the greater Boston area for the 74-hour Building Operator Certification training. Upon completing the training, municipal building engineers will be able to operate and maintain local government buildings more efficiently, saving energy and helping both utilities meet energy efficiency targets.
Balance worker supply with energy efficiency demand
Cities can encourage demand for energy efficiency workers by enacting efficiency policies and programs. They can also leverage citywide energy and sustainability planning to align training programs around current and future city-, state-, and utility-funded efficiency incentives.
Vancouver, BC. Vancouver launched several initiatives to teach skills required to build in accordance with its Zero Emissions Building Plan. The city plans to subsidize trainings for builders and developers to learn more about passive house design standards, technical building requirements, economic and energy impacts, and energy modeling tools. Additionally, Vancouver will contribute funds to the Zero Emissions Building Centre of Excellence, a nonprofit-run collaborative platform that will compile and disseminate zero-emission building educational resources to the local building industry. The center is expected to launch this summer.
Increase diversity and equity in the energy efficiency workforce
Any locally driven workforce development strategy should consider the needs of people who are underrepresented in the energy efficiency sector. For example, cities can direct city- or industry-led trainings to low-income community members by coordinating with organizations that understand their needs. They can also work to ensure that minority- and women-owned businesses are aware of efficiency project opportunities in public buildings.
New Orleans, LA. Through partnerships with the US Green Building Council and Louisiana and Delgado Community Colleges, the New Orleans Office of Supplier Diversity works to train small and disadvantaged businesses on green economy initiatives, for example, by holding a test preparation class for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design exam. The city also works with APTIM, Entergy New Orleans’ efficiency program administrator, to teach local builders and operators high-performance construction principles through the Green Professional Operations and Maintenance (GPRO) Essentials course. New Orleans offers this program to drive participation in its Downtown Energy Challenge and works to include from individuals from local workforce development organizations such as the Urban League of Louisiana.
Cities and our clean energy economy
The opportunity is clear for cities interested in leading an equitable transition to a clean energy economy. By investing in a robust, diverse, and local energy efficiency workforce, cities can save energy, reduce pollution, and sustain high-quality jobs for their residents. In this report, we identify additional strategies for cities to make these goals a reality, and we highlight an array of cities that are moving in the right direction.

Car Buyers Rank Fuel Economy as a Top Priority;"The Trump administration is expected to propose any day a rollback of greenhouse gas and fuel economy standards, based partly on the notion that Americans are not interested in efficient vehicles. However a new study shows that American consumers consider fuel efficiency one of a vehicle’s most important features — along with price, reliability, and safety.
In fact, they rank fuel economy considerably ahead of premium features and acceleration, according to our survey of 1,883 US drivers who planned to purchase a new or used vehicle within the next 10 years. The survey used four strategies to identify the vehicle attributes sought by potential car buyers: an open-ended question, a selection of options, a rank ordering of options, and a discrete choice experiment (looking at choices among hypothetical vehicle options).
The results are clear: Americans want fuel economy.
“Thinking about your next vehicle, which aspects are the most important to you?”
In response to this question, we found that respondents’ answers most often clustered around four main themes: safety, reliability, price, and fuel economy.
“Select up to six of these features that are most important to you”
From a list of 19 popular features based on previous studies and expert consultations, consumers selected four options most frequently: purchase costs (purchase price and monthly payments, 72%), reliability (69%), safety (crash protection and avoidance, 66%), and fuel economy (59%). Notably, participants selected performance or acceleration half as frequently as fuel economy (29%). This matches a later task in the study in which consumers rank-ordered fuel economy ahead of acceleration and premium features, but behind safety, reliability, and purchase price.
“Which vehicle would you prefer?”
We asked participants to choose their preferred vehicles from several vehicle sets using a discrete choice experiment. Each vehicle set had three options that we varied systematically. Combining participants’ vehicle selections across sets, we were able to figure out the relative value consumers placed on each attribute without explicitly asking them. Participants indicated a willingness to pay most for a 25% increase in reliability, safety, and fuel economy. They were willing to pay least for a 25% increase in acceleration and premium features.
Our study’s four measures of vehicle attribute preferences triangulate on one answer: Americans considering a new or used vehicle consistently select the cost of safety, reliability, and fuel economy as top priorities, while they attach less importance to performance attributes such as acceleration.
Fuel economy information affects consumers’ decisions and attitudes
Not only did consumers value fuel economy, but the presence of the information also significantly affected the respondents’ stated choices. Consumers who were presented with fuel economy information chose vehicles that were more efficient, and the presence of this information influenced their overall attitudes about fuel economy. When presented with fuel economy information during the first part of the study, respondents subsequently ranked it significantly higher (relative to other attributes) at the end of the study.
Nevertheless studies of actual vehicle purchases suggest that consumers’ walk doesn’t always match their talk. Why might this be the case? Manufacturers may not offer the combinations of features included in the studies, and consumers cannot choose options that are not available to them. For example, high efficiency may be bundled with premium features, putting the more-efficient vehicle out of the buyer’s price range.  Furthermore few car buyers have the tools to calculate future gas prices and savings for each vehicle they consider. And consumers’ competing priorities at the time of purchase may diminish the impact of any one factor, such as fuel economy. In general, however, more research is needed on how to allow consumer preferences to be better realized in action.
If consumers value fuel economy, are fuel economy standards needed? Yes.
Fuel economy standards help consumers follow through on their purchase intentions by ensuring a broad array of fuel-efficient vehicle offerings. Consumers recognize this: 79% of Americans (including 68% of Republicans) support increasing fuel efficiency standards. The standards protect domestic manufacturers as well; part of the reason that the American auto industry collapsed in 2008-2010 was that auto producers were unprepared to meet a surge in demand for fuel economy. Rising standards will ensure that manufacturers continue to improve their vehicle offerings, unless the Trump administration gets in the way.

Our rural initiative aims to jumpstart rural America’s untapped potential for energy;"Saving energy saves money everywhere — in cities, suburbs, small towns, and remote, sparsely populated areas. But for those living in the 75% of the United States considered to be rural, energy efficiency programs can be hard to come by. That is why ACEEE is launching a new rural research initiative, aimed at understanding the unique energy efficiency needs of those living in sparsely populated areas and finding solutions to the challenges they face. With rising energy costs and proposed cuts to rural development funding it is a critical time for these often underserved residents of rural America.
What does it mean to be in a rural or small-town area?
Rural America is not just large fields of crops and combine harvesters. It includes small towns with older homes, energy-intensive manufacturing facilities, and small family farms.
Just as rural and small-town America’s lifestyle is unique to its geography, so too are its energy, economic, and societal challenges, cueing the need for tailored energy efficiency programs. Delivering energy efficiency programs is particularly challenging for any utility serving rural customers because low-population density may mean higher program cost per capita. Access to the technical and financial resources needed to design and implement tailored energy efficiency programs can be an obstacle for utilities serving rural areas, whether they are electric cooperatives (co-ops), municipal utilities (munis), or investor-owned utilities (IOUs). All the while, the average rural population is aging, as the younger population relocates to find jobs in metro areas, leaving a dearth of energy audit and retrofit workers.
However, there is a reason for hope. At last year’s SEEA & AESP TRANSFORM Rural Pre-Conference Session, an overflowing room of rural electric cooperatives (co-ops) and local energy stakeholders provided evidence that energy efficiency helped their customers and businesses, reminding those in Washington DC — and across the nation — that rural America presents unique opportunities that make it a worthwhile investment.
Unique rural opportunities
Rural electric co-ops are particularly poised to design and implement energy efficiency programs. Many co-ops buy their electricity supply from larger utilities (that own generation) and resell it to their members (customers). Therefore, it is in the co-op’s economic interest to help its members save energy, so it can spend less on power from the utility that charges high peak-time rates. Co-ops also offer the advantage of functioning like a living lab for pilot programs because their smaller service territory and member base can make rolling out and adjusting a new program easier than it is for a large IOU. IOUs and municipal utilities can also help deliver energy efficiency to their rural customers, opening the opportunity to tap into the multiple value streams of energy efficiency.
Our rural research initiative
The energy issues that persist in rural America represent untapped potential for large energy and cost savings that can tangibly improve the quality of life of rural families and help businesses manage their energy costs. ACEEE’s 2018 rural research initiative is designed to make those savings a reality. Through research reports, blog posts, and a webinar series, we will answer the following questions with the help of co-ops, municipal utilities, IOUs, and other key experts:
What is the average household energy burden for rural households and what households face the highest energy burden?
What energy efficiency programs are currently being delivered in rural areas?
What are the key barriers to delivery of energy efficiency in rural areas? How have individual programs sought to overcome those barriers? What innovative strategies should be deployed elsewhere?
How can utilities with large service territories effectively tailor energy efficiency offerings to rural communities?
How are utility-sector energy efficiency programs leveraging non-ratepayer funding sources to reach more rural residents? What are key considerations for leveraging federal funding, financing, and other funding sources effectively?
To what extent are utilities and efficiency program implementers assessing broader economic development impacts of energy efficiency programs in rural areas and small towns?
Our efforts will include the 2018 Rural Energy Conference in Atlanta on October 22. At the conference, cooperatives, utilities, policymakers, efficiency providers, investors, and financiers will share best practices for implementing and financing energy efficiency programs that alleviate energy burdens for low-income rural residents, and help spur economic development in small-town communities.

Program administrators can stay ahead of the curve with high-efficiency air conditioners;"With as many as four billion additional air conditioning units expected to be in use by 2050, the value of highly efficient air conditioners will only increase over the next few decades. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently predicted that as power plants generate more electricity for these units, greenhouse gas emissions could nearly double from 1.25 billion tons in 2016 to 2.28 billion tons in 2050. This could be the start of a vicious air-conditioning cycle, but energy efficiency program administrators have the power to help break it.
When developing 2019 programs, administrators should resist the temptation to focus just on obtaining short-term, incremental energy savings and instead follow the best practice guidance laid out in the US Environmental Protection Agency's National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency: “Make a strong, long-term commitment to cost-effective energy efficiency as a resource” [emphasis added].
By taking a long-term view and focusing on the deployment of highly efficient air conditioners, program administrators can position their programs to achieve large energy savings in 2030 and beyond, even as more air conditioners are installed worldwide. To help program administrators in this effort, ACEEE recently completed two technical briefs on HVAC equipment, one focusing on residential equipment and one on commercial equipment. These briefs describe the current market as well as costs and energy savings for very high efficiency equipment.
Residential Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps
Commercial Air Conditioners
Strategies for Success
For new construction programs, a long-term commitment means going beyond the typical 10% or 20% energy savings per project and working toward long-term targets for zero energy building performance, as programs operated by the Energy Trust of Oregon and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) are now doing.  
Likewise, for residential and commercial heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC), programs should consider increasing emphasis on very-efficient equipment to help shift the HVAC market toward this type of equipment in the long term. Premium HVAC equipment can be identified by its high efficiency ratings. The most-efficient residential models have an 18+ Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER), while the most-efficient packaged rooftop units have an Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio (IEER) of 17+ (SEER ratings of 15-17 and IEER ratings of 13-16 could be considered middle tiers for residential and rooftop units, respectively).
Additionally, more advanced models typically use variable speed drives, which save energy by responding more effectively to changing outside temperatures and conditions. They may also include advanced controls, which can reduce or shut off HVAC use when the building or home is unoccupied. Even more simply, one could look for ENERGY STAR’s Most Efficient designation for residential products or CEE’s Advanced Tier for commercial equipment.
Most major manufacturers produce at least a few premium models. Unfortunately, data show that these units make up just a small fraction of the units sold (typically less than 3% of the market depending on equipment size, region, etc.), but modifications to energy efficiency programs could help influence the market in favor of higher-efficiency equipment. For instance, instead of providing similar rebates for 15, 16, and 18 SEER residential air conditioners and heat pumps, programs could consider a tiered approach with lower incentives for 15 and 16 SEER (initial and middle tier) units and significantly higher incentives for 18 SEER (advanced tier), or they could eliminate incentives for the lower tiers entirely.
In addition to prioritizing premium equipment, evidence shows that shifting from downstream incentives (i.e., customer rebates) to a midstream model (i.e., distributor incentives) can increase program uptake. The commercial market has paved the way with midstream programs offered by Pacific Gas and Electric, Xcel Energy-Colorado, and Mass Save, and residential programs could also benefit from this type of model.
Moving toward a cooler future
Highly efficient air conditioners reduce both energy use and peak demand. For many program administrators, this equipment will be a cost-effective way to achieve energy savings starting in 2019, while paving the way for a shift to ultra-high efficiency air conditioners and heat pumps in the long term.

Gimme shelter: how energy efficiency can contribute to resilient rebuilding;"The Atlantic hurricane season is just beginning, and experts are predicting another active year. With that forecast and last year’s devastating storms in mind, many are calling for a rebuilding strategy that reduces the risk of repeated devastation by building more resilient communities. Energy efficiency should be a central component of that strategy. Its technologies and practices can make our electric grids and built environment more resilient during extreme weather events.
Congress has a chance to get this right. The US House of Representatives has already passed key provisions of a relevant bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, with a bipartisan vote on a broader bill necessary to extend the Federal Aviation Administration’s authority. The bill, now under consideration in the Senate, would amend the Stafford Act to allow cost-effective pre-disaster risk mitigation and rebuilding using the latest “hazard-resistant designs” and building codes.
As this bill and others are considered, energy-efficient technologies should be recognized as elements of hazard-resistant design and more broadly as an essential component of resilient infrastructure. Here are some approaches that work.
Combined heat and power, microgrids, and district energy systems
Combined heat and power (CHP) systems provide power and fulfill thermal needs for many hospitals, larger buildings, and campuses by generating electricity and heat in an integrated way, while also reducing wasted energy. They have been providing energy and refuge through extreme weather events for years. During and after Superstorm Sandy, Long Island’s South Oaks Hospital, Little Ferry Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) in New Jersey, and many multifamily buildings kept the lights and heat on, thanks to CHP. The population of one Manhattan residential complex that relied on CHP to power its heating, water system, elevators, and electricity nearly doubled while providing refuge to neighbors during the storm.
CHP-powered microgrids and district energy systems can provide additional resilience benefits. Microgrids connect selected buildings and facilities to distributed energy supplies. They are usually connected to the grid but can disconnect from the grid and supply power independently when the grid is incapacitated, enhancing resilience. Microgrids can even provide reliable power during storms. During times of stress, microgrids can reduce demand on the larger grid with energy efficiency programs, demand response, and intelligent management systems that help to ensure local supplies can meet demand when the microgrid is operating independently. For example, during Superstorm Sandy, Co-op City in the Bronx maintained power for its 50,000 residential and commercial consumers using gas and steam turbines for CHP and large gas boilers for thermal energy. Co-op City’s microgrid, one of the largest in the world, even exported 10,700 MWh to the grid during the polar vortex of 2013.
District energy systems often use efficient CHP units to supply not only electricity but also hot water or steam and chilled water to buildings for space heating, domestic hot water, air conditioning, and industrial-process energy. They can also use thermal energy storage and waste heat rather than grid power, which reduces electric grid demand. For example, as historic flooding in the Brays Bayou devastated the Houston region during Hurricane Harvey, a CHP-power district energy system ensured that the air conditioning, refrigeration, heating, sterilization, laundry, and hot water needs of Texas Medical Center were met throughout the storm. Such systems can also provide benefits to the grid during regular operations. The Texas Medical Center system has the capacity to meet 100% of summer peak power needs and still export excess power to the grid during peak events.
Building energy codes
Strong building energy codes should serve an important role in hazard mitigation strategies for resilient buildings. Building codes ensure that new buildings meet health and safety requirements, including resilience during and after severe weather events. Energy codes, which set minimum energy efficiency thresholds, are one important aspect of the need for improved building codes overall.
For example, building thermal performance, one factor addressed by building codes, is an important indicator of energy resilience. Increasing the efficiency of a home by improving the building envelope can make a home more comfortable during power outages as efficient buildings stay warm or cool longer than inefficient buildings. Efficient buildings also reduce occupants’ vulnerability to heat waves and cold snaps.
Preparing for the future
Broadly, Congress, federal agencies, and local governments must allow for rebuilding with new technology that enhances resilience, not just rebuilding what we had. Making energy efficiency a part of disaster preparedness and post-disaster rebuilding will advance technology, reduce waste, improve resilience, and save money for generations of future consumers on a massive scale.

For summer travelers, improved fuel economy can help offset pain at the pump;"A near-record number of families are hitting the road over Memorial Day weekend, just as gas prices are projected to climb to a four-year high. Watching prices creep upward is bringing back painful memories for many Americans, but improved fuel economy is making road trips more affordable than before.
We last saw summer gas prices rise above $3 per gallon at the height of the recession in 2008, when average vehicle fuel economy was only 21 miles per gallon (MPG). This time around, the economy is stronger and vehicles are markedly more fuel efficient, meaning families today are better prepared for higher fuel costs despite the resurgence in popularity of trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). In fact, average model year 2017 fuel economy is expected to exceed 25 MPG, with more-efficient options available in every vehicle segment. The resulting fuel savings can be quite substantial, as we demonstrate with one of the most popular vehicles sold: the Ford F-150.
In model year 2008, the most-efficient four-wheel-drive F-150 had a rated fuel economy of 15 MPG. Today, a similar F-150 gets 21 MPG — a whopping 40% improvement. The savings are impressive: for every 1,000 miles driven, a 2018 F-150 would use 19 fewer gallons of gas than the 2008 model (more than enough fuel savings offset the 28% hike in gas prices we’ve seen since last Memorial Day).
In other words, a roundtrip cross-country road trip in a F-150 — from D.C. to Yosemite National Park, for example — would cost $320 less. And if gas prices creep up further, the savings become even more substantial.
This comparison demonstrates the real-world benefits of increased fuel economy: guaranteed savings at the pump and a smaller impact on families’ budgets when gas prices rise. We use the F-150 example because of its sheer popularity, but nearly all new mainstream cars, trucks, and SUVs offer substantial savings over the older models they replace. Plus, it isn’t just owners of brand new vehicles who benefit from fuel economy standards. Fuel economy has been steadily improving for almost a decade, and more-efficient vehicles have since become widely available in the used car market. You can easily explore vehicle options at greenercars.org and calculate your own potential fuel savings with the vehicles of your choice using the fueleconomy.gov trip calculator.
It’s a good time to remember that fuel economy gains of this magnitude wouldn’t occur without fuel economy standards. But those very standards are now at risk despite their enormous benefits. Under the standards currently in place, a full-size pickup truck meeting model year 2025 fuel economy requirements would average more than 26 MPG, saving $83 and 28 gallons of gas for every 1,000 miles driven, as compared to the 2008 model.
Without the standards, drivers will spend more money at the pump for years to come and will be more vulnerable to fluctuating gas prices. But with consistent fuel economy gains spurred by the standards, families will pay less to take advantage of America’s expansive highways and rich variety of destinations on a good, old-fashioned road trip.
Correction (7/10/18): The graphic in this blog post has been updated with revised numbers for the 2008 model year gallons of gas, 2008 model year fuel cost, and 2018 fuel cost savings.

Iowa Takes Huge Step Backward on Energy Efficiency, While Other States Move Ahead;"Iowa used to be known as a state very supportive of energy efficiency, but some recent news has people around the nation wondering what Iowa is thinking. Last Friday, Governor Kim Reynolds signed a bill (SF2311) that will severely curtail utility energy efficiency programs in the state. With a party line vote in the senate and a stroke of the governor’s pen, Iowa’s longstanding position as an energy efficiency leader in the Midwest has come to an end. Fortunately, a number of other states are providing examples of positive action on energy efficiency.
A three-pronged attack in Iowa
The new law deals three major blows to energy efficiency. First, it removes any requirement for energy efficiency programs by municipal utilities and co-ops (which together serve about one-third of homes in the state). Second, it imposes a spending cap on any requirements for energy efficiency by investor-owned utilities; this will likely cut programs by at least half. And third, it creates a nationally unprecedented policy allowing any customer to opt out of paying for utility efficiency programs if the utility’s package of programs doesn’t pass the Ratepayer Impact Measure test (RIM test). 
That latter provision is particularly destructive. Energy efficiency programs almost never pass the RIM test because reduced sales revenues to the utility are treated as a cost; typically the more energy a program saves, the worse it does on the RIM test. That is why, prior to this legislation, no state in the country used the RIM as its primary cost-effectiveness test to screen out programs (and in fact, the one state that relied on RIM in any significant way — Virginia — recently solidified its move away from RIM).
This provision could create chaos for utility energy efficiency programs in Iowa. It will make it impossible to plan ahead and budget for how many customers will be eligible and how many will opt out. It will also turn utilities and participating retailers and contractors into “rebate police.” While any customer could participate in an energy efficiency program (e.g., receive a rebate for energy-efficient appliances and upgrades) before SF2311 was passed, customers will now have to be individually screened and checked for eligibility.  The utility/contractor/retailer will have to refuse participation if the customer has opted out.  
A retreat from Iowa’s own energy plan that promoted energy efficiency
Some hoped that Governor Reynolds would veto the bill because she spearheaded the development of the Iowa Energy Plan (published in December 2016) while she was Lieutenant Governor. The plan prioritized state policies aimed at encouraging energy efficiency. Of particular irony is the new law’s exemption of efficiency requirements for co-ops, given the Iowa Energy Plan’s repeated references to the need to provide greater access to energy efficiency for customers in rural and underserved areas. Nevertheless, Governor Reynolds signed the bill late last Friday. 
Other states taking bold action to advance energy efficiency
Fortunately, in contrast to Iowa’s huge step backward, several other states are moving ahead with efforts to expand utility energy efficiency achievements. In Michigan, the major utilities recently filed plans to hit new, higher savings targets in response to increased incentives contained in the most recent energy efficiency policy legislation, which also eliminated the previous spending cap. Illinois also advanced significant energy efficiency policy legislation that went into effect in 2017, which significantly increased utility electricity savings targets and raised the previous spending cap.  It also made important improvements to the definition of cost effectiveness and shifted the goal focus from simple annual savings to cumulative persistent energy savings. By coincidence, each of those significant legislative actions occurred in the same month that Iowa published the Iowa Energy Plan (December 2016).  But unlike Iowa, Michigan and Illinois are following through and moving forward aggressively to increase their energy efficiency achievements.
In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy signed legislation in April that established energy saving targets ramping up to 2.0% annual incremental electricity savings and 0.75% annual incremental natural gas savings over five years. And in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo recently announced a goal to save at least 185 trillion British thermal units (Btus) of energy by 2025. Details are still being developed (including the impacts of state building codes, equipment efficiency standards, and expanded electrification efforts), but they include ramping up electricity savings to 3% per year by 2025, as well as increased efforts to foster oil and gas savings.
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam signed legislation in March that should significantly increase energy efficiency in the Commonwealth by requiring certain levels of investment in efficiency for the largest utilities. As noted above, the law also requires that programs that pass three of the four cost-effectiveness tests be approved by regulators even if they don’t pass the RIM test. On the downside, the law also exempts large customers from energy efficiency programs entirely.
States maintain leadership on efficiency despite setback
While the recent backsliding in Iowa is certainly disappointing, plenty of other states are taking positive steps to advance energy efficiency in the utility sector. These states have recognized the multiple benefits of efficiency, whether that’s reducing consumer energy costs, creating job opportunities, helping to reduce energy burdens for those most in need, or combatting climate change. Hopefully, Iowa will soon return to its past tradition of strong energy efficiency performance and thereby realize the many benefits to consumers and the state economy. In the meantime we will continue working to combat policy setbacks and promote state policies that bring the multiple benefits of efficiency to states nationwide.

A rising tide: Energy efficiency now employs 2.25 million Americans;"Looking for a job or smart investment? The energy efficiency field is an increasingly good bet for workers and financiers. Here’s why: new data show it employed 2.25 million Americans last year — more than the combined total of jobs to produce coal, oil, gas, and electricity (including renewables).
These data are contained in the 2018 U.S. Energy & Employment Report (USEER), compiled by the National Association of State Energy Officials and the Energy Futures Initiative, a nonprofit think tank founded by former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. The groups secured private funding to continue the report, which the US Department of Energy had previously issued in 2016 and 2017.
“Over the last three years, the most surprising finding has been the sustained growth of energy efficiency jobs,” the groups said in releasing their report, noting a 3% increase from 2016 to 2017. Their release said the efficiency sector has “flattened electricity demand, driven greenhouse gas reductions, made American manufacturers more competitive and created millions of jobs.”
The report counts part-time or full-time workers who design, make, or install ENERGY STAR®-certified products or install other advanced building materials such as insulation. The majority of these jobs — 57% — are in construction, where workers install efficient insulation, windows, lighting, and heating and cooling equipment. Others occur in manufacturing, wholesale trade as well as professional and business services.
The efficiency job tally is a conservative number. It doesn’t include jobs related to energy-efficient manufacturing processes or combined heat and power systems. As a prior ACEEE post explains, it doesn’t include indirect jobs that result when customers spend or invest the money they save in lower energy bills somewhere else in the economy. It also doesn’t include the 650,000-plus jobs that the report said are focused on increasing fuel economy or transitioning to alternative fuels, and it doesn’t include retail jobs. Citing Bureau of Labor Statistics, it said another 4.2 million Americans work in retail trade industries that sell or distribute ENERGY STAR appliances and building materials, along with other products.
The report said more than 60% of energy efficiency employers, especially in the construction industry, have difficulty finding qualified job applicants because of a lack of experience, training or technical skills. On a positive note, it said these employers expect efficiency jobs will increase 9% this year.

American University just graduated to carbon neutral, thanks partly to energy efficiency;"As college students across the country graduate, proud parents and friends are celebrating, but my alma mater also deserves some fanfare. American University (AU) did more than graduate the class of 2018 last weekend; it recently became the first carbon-neutral university in the United States. Located in the nation’s capital, it is also the first carbon-neutral urban campus, demonstrating that AU is as environmentally conscious as it is patriotic (yes, the school’s colors are red, white, and blue).
Soaring high with energy efficiency
Reaching carbon neutrality is an ambitious goal, and AU developed a comprehensive plan that included a variety of energy efficiency measures. One of the university’s first efforts was to cut its carbon emissions by reducing energy use in new and existing buildings across campus. In a new Green Building Policy, AU pledged that it would construct new buildings to LEED Gold standards and manage existing campus buildings to LEED standards as well. Today, the campus boasts six LEED-certified buildings, with four more on track to meet those standards.
The new home of the university’s School of International Service, completed in 2010, is one of the LEED Gold-certified buildings. It was designed with both energy efficiency and aesthetics in mind. The atrium’s roof consists of 98 “fritted” glass panels covered in a perforated white sheet that absorbs ultraviolet rays and prevents excessive indoor heat gain. This allows the area to be filled with natural light while also limiting the energy needed to light and cool the space. The university also took a chance on an energy-efficient duct system that is rarely used on the East Coast, while also relying on more-common LED lights in the building’s underground parking garage.
To cut carbon emissions and energy use in the university’s LEED-certified McKinley Building, AU’s Energy and Engineering team worked with German-based company MeteoViva and the DC Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) on a year-long pilot project. MeteoViva’s software used data on heating and cooling usage as well as weather forecast data to calculate optimal heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) settings. Despite the challenges posed by McKinley’s structure (such as varying levels of natural light throughout the building, and different types of spaces including classrooms and a theater), the project was a success. It inspired improvements that made occupants more comfortable, cut HVAC operational costs by 36%, and reduced the building’s carbon footprint by 473 tons.
The pilot project built on AU’s previous collaboration with DCSEU. In 2016, AU worked with ThermaXX Jackets to install custom-made insulation jackets on HVAC components at its central heating plant as part of DCSEU’s custom incentive program. The jackets will save more than 7,000 therms of energy annually and more than $56,800 over the jackets’ lifetime.
Altogether, the university’s energy efficiency efforts have paid off. AU reached its goal of carbon neutrality two years early, and the university now uses 21% less energy per square foot than it did in 2005.
Colleges are reducing their environmental footprint
AU is far from the only college or university relying on energy efficiency to cut energy use and carbon emissions, and for good reason. The entire higher education sector spends more than $6 billion on energy costs each year. But universities have a variety of proven energy-efficient tools and tactics that also save money.
As part of its Energy System Innovations approach, Stanford University slashed its energy use 70% by switching to a solar and electric heat recovery system that avoids 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year. Arizona State University undertook upgrades to make its Student Pavilion zero energy ready, cutting energy use 52% and saving $51,000 in the process. And the University of California, Irvine developed a new “Smart Lab” approach that shows that universities can make their laboratories safer and cut energy use by as much as 60% with measures such as occupancy and air quality sensors.
Students can shrink their footprint — or dorm print — too
Colleges and universities need students to chip in if they want to maximize energy savings, and some schools are actively engaging students. Brown University, for example, created a Green Packing List for students to reference as they shop for the new school year. Brown also gives each college freshman a free LED desk lamp, rents ENERGY STARÒ fridges, and sells energy-efficient products in its bookstore.
ACEEE’s SmarterHouse also offers a variety of resources for environmentally conscious college students through our Shrink Your Dorm Print campaign. Visit the website to find energy-saving tips and a shopping list, among other resources.
Reach for the carbon-neutral stars
Reaching carbon neutrality requires a team effort. Together, we can work to cut energy use, reduce carbon emissions, and protect the environment. American University demonstrated that working together to reach carbon neutrality pays off, so who will be next?

Efficiency and renewables: the dream team for a clean energy future;"With the promising trend of plunging prices for renewable energy, there may be a temptation to wonder whether energy efficiency is still cost effective. The answer is a very affirmative “yes.”  As companies, cities, and states work to keep energy costs down and meet ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, the choice should not be energy efficiency versus renewable energy. To meet these goals, we need to maximize both resources.  
Energy efficiency remains generally less expensive than renewable energy, so even if renewables are plentiful, using efficiency to reduce electrical loads can still save money. While there have been a few bids of 2-3 cents per kWh for utility-scale renewable power, they include federal renewable energy subsidies that will soon end and do not reflect all of the costs of a renewable energy grid. Yes, renewable prices are coming down, but a hefty dose of efficiency is still needed to minimize both long-term costs and emissions. And incorporating efficiency also brings many other benefits including improved comfort, health, and worker productivity, reduced energy burdens, new jobs, expanded economic development, and increased grid resilience.
The cost of efficiency, home solar, and centralized renewables
Comparisons between energy efficiency and renewable energy are very different at the customer and utility levels. Work by ACEEE and LBL has found that energy efficiency typically costs an electric utility (or other program administrator) an average of about 3 cents per kWh saved over the lifetime of the efficiency measure (while this is the average, portfolio costs vary among program administrators, in the range of about 1.5-5 cents per kWh, according to the ACEEE study linked above). This amount can be compared to the cost to generate power (e.g., from fossil fuels or renewables) and bring it to a home or business. Efficiency’s cost has been surprisingly level in recent years, as shown in the figure below, even with continuing increases in savings. 
Levelized cost of saved energy for 14 utilities with large efficiency programs. From ACEEE Big Savers.
The cost of efficiency to the utility does not include participant costs. When those costs are included, ACEEE and LBL find that the price per kWh roughly doubles to an average of about 6 cents per kWh. This total all-in cost can be compared to the cost of on-site renewables, such as rooftop solar.
Renewable energy costs vary by application and have declined over time. To simplify this discussion, let’s look at the lowest unsubsidized cost per an analysis by Lazard Associates. The lowest cost today is likely to be the average cost at some point in the future, and thus by emphasizing the lowest cost today, we implicitly assume some future price declines.
First, let’s look at customer costs. Today, the lowest unsubsidized cost for residential rooftop solar is about 18.7 cents per kWh, more than three times the average all-in cost for energy efficiency. Commercial and industrial solar bottoms out at 8.5 cents per kWh and community solar at 7.6 cents per kWh, both of which are more expensive than the average efficiency measure.
Next, let’s look at utility costs. For utility-scale renewables, the lowest unsubsidized cost for wind is 3.0 cents per kWh, and the lowest cost for photovoltaics is 4.3 cents per kWh. A few projects have come in with lower costs, but these costs take advantage of federal renewable energy tax credits that are scheduled to phase out over the next few years. These costs can be compared to the 3 cents per kWh average cost of efficiency to the utility that we discussed earlier. It should also be noted that much new generation is fueled by natural gas, and Lazard estimates the levelized cost of new gas combined-cycle turbines at 4.2-7.8 cents per kWh. This is more expensive than average efficiency as well as many centralized wind and solar projects.
Adding utility transmission, distribution, and storage costs
The cost of utility-scale renewables does not include the cost of transmission and distribution (T&D) upgrades that are sometimes needed to bring power from centralized renewables to homes and businesses. These costs vary widely but can add approximately 2 cents per kWh to the cost of some centralized renewable energy projects and can also increase the benefits of energy efficiency and rooftop solar by roughly the same amount (e.g., Baatz found that avoided T&D costs ranged from $0 to more than $200 per kW-year, with an average cost of about $70 per kW-year; if this capacity is used about 3,000 hours per year — a rough estimate of typical use — then the average avoided T&D cost for efficiency savings or customer-sited renewables is on the order of 2 cents per kWh).
In addition, as renewables make up an increasing share of grid power, some energy storage will be needed, which can add costs at the utility or customer level. For example, two utility-scale hybrid solar plus storage projects coming on line this year have levelized costs of 10.8 and 13.9 cents per kWh supplied. McKinsey & Company reports that the overall incremental cost for using storage to firm up wind or solar power can range from 2 to 10 cents per kWh. When average avoided T&D costs and the minimum storage costs are added to the low end of wind and solar costs, the power costs the utility 7-8 cents per kWh, more than double the cost of efficiency to the utility.
Integrating efficiency and renewables
Because energy efficiency is typically one-third to half the full cost of rooftop solar, it generally makes sense to take efficiency opportunities into account before sizing a rooftop system, reducing the size of the system that needs to be purchased. For example, as I noted in a prior blog post, instead of installing a 5 kW home solar system, efficiency can be used to reduce demand. The result: the home may need only a 3.5 kW system, reducing the investment by $2,500 per home, even after including the cost of the efficiency improvements.
Likewise if efficiency is used to reduce total utility system loads, the cost of a grid with a high percentage of renewable generation can be substantially reduced. For example, a recent study by the International Renewable Energy Agency found that pursuing both efficiency and renewables will increase the share of load supplied by renewables (because total loads are reduced) and reduce system costs and carbon emissions relative to both business-as-usual and renewable-only scenarios.
However not all efficiency costs the utility 3 cents per kWh or has a total cost of about 6 cents per kWh. Some programs cost more. For example, LBL found that whole-home and low-income weatherization programs cost utilities an average of 15 cents per kWh saved. These programs may be more expensive than renewables, and thus program implementers should look for ways to reduce these costs or find other sources of funds to complement utility funding for such programs. For example the Bronx Healthy Buildings program combines weatherization and health funds to make weatherization and other improvements to multifamily buildings with high incidences of asthma-related emergency room visits and hospital admissions.
A collective path to a clean energy future
For the United States to minimize long-term energy costs and meet greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, both energy efficiency and renewable energy will need to play a substantial role. Efficiency can reduce loads at both the household and grid levels, and renewables can provide much of the remaining needed power. As we noted in an earlier blog post, energy efficiency and renewable energy are like peanut butter and jelly — it’s hard to imagine one without the other.

"Affordable housing is disappearing; energy efficiency and solar energy can help reverse that trend";"Many low-income individuals and families are finding it increasingly difficult to rent apartments (see here and here), but energy efficiency and solar energy can help save affordable multifamily housing. Our new report, Our Powers Combined: Energy Efficiency and Solar in Affordable Multifamily Buildings, shows how building owners are combining energy efficiency upgrades and rooftop solar systems to reduce energy use and lower their energy bills. These upgrades enable housing providers to devote more resources to preserving and expanding affordable housing, while also improving the health and well-being of building residents.
Combining energy efficiency and solar leads to positive results
Foundation Communities, an affordable housing provider in Austin, Texas, has substantially reduced the energy costs of its multifamily buildings by combining energy efficiency upgrades with rooftop solar systems. In 2012, the organization installed several such improvements at its Arbor Terrace property including ENERGY STAR®–compliant lamps, heat pump air conditioners equipped with occupancy sensors, and metal roofing to increase reflectivity and decrease the building’s need for cooling. Foundation Communities also installed a rooftop solar system along with water conservation measures at the property. Today, the building’s utility costs are one-quarter less than a typical multifamily property.
However projects like these are not without their challenges. Foundation Communities has found that the performance of energy efficiency and solar equipment is largely dependent on whether staff and residents understand how to properly use and maintain it. Training and educating those living and working in multifamily buildings on the use of newer energy technologies can improve building energy performance.
Affordable multifamily energy efficiency and solar projects can also present substantial upfront planning and development costs for housing providers. To overcome this hurdle, the National Housing Trust Enterprise Preservation Corporation (NHT-Enterprise) is installing both energy efficiency and solar resources across all of its buildings in Washington, DC. Taking this portfolio-wide approach to reducing energy use has allowed the organization to save on upfront project costs, aggregate energy cost savings, and leverage savings to preserve more affordable housing.
Affordable housing providers cannot go it alone
Affordable multifamily housing providers need supportive policies and programs to help them integrate energy efficiency and solar resources. For example, building owners often rely on incentives to make investments that will reduce their energy costs. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers lower mortgage insurance premiums for green energy-efficient housing, and some state housing finance agencies (HFAs) incentivize or require that projects pursuing Low-Income Housing Tax Credits reduce a building’s energy use.
When Connecticut set out to renovate its affordable State-Sponsored Housing Portfolio, the state realized that renovation projects undervalued energy savings absent specific requirements or incentives to do so. This led the state’s housing agencies, utilities, and Green Bank to maximize energy savings in affordable multifamily buildings by coordinating and streamlining the delivery of their incentive and financing programs.
Local and state governments can also support these projects by setting and holding themselves accountable to energy efficiency and climate change goals that reduce the energy burdens of their low-income and minority residents. Many states require that energy efficiency and solar incentive programs benefit low-income and underserved communities. California requires utilities to allocate a portion of greenhouse gas auction proceeds to benefit these communities, providing critical support for the state’s Low-Income Weatherization Program for Multifamily (LIWP-MF). This program has successfully tackled the challenge of split incentives between owners and renters. Under most circumstances, owners are not able to justify projects that reduce residents’ energy costs because there is little or no return for investors. LIWP-MF has overcome this challenge by offering high incentives to building owners for energy efficiency upgrades and solar systems that benefit renters. Thus far, the program has reduced participating affordable multifamily buildings’ energy use by an average of 44% and is projected to save more than $48 million in utility bill costs and avoid 120,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent over the next 15 years.
Where we go from here
While our report covers only a handful of projects and programs, they offer valuable lessons for housing providers, policymakers, program administrators, and private investors. Innovative and supportive policies at the federal, state, and local levels can encourage building owners to make energy efficiency upgrades and install rooftop solar projects that together cut energy use, lower energy bills, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. These policies and projects can help preserve and expand affordable housing in a market that offers few such options for low-income families and individuals.
Join us for a webinar at 1:00 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 15, or at ACEEE’s 2018 Energy Efficiency Finance Forum, as we discuss the report’s key findings and further explore how energy efficiency and solar energy can help save affordable multifamily housing.

Energy efficiency can help 32 states meet clean air rules by cutting pollution;"Energy efficiency is a proven, low-cost way to reduce pollutants, and it can significantly help 32 states comply with US air quality regulations, according to our new report, Mission Attainment: Incorporating Pollution Reductions from Energy Efficiency in State Implementation Plans.
Despite its value, many states are not taking credit for using energy efficiency to meet federal standards. The US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set limits on six criteria pollutants that are harmful to public health and welfare. States are required to develop state implementation plans (SIPs) to maintain or achieve these standards. While state air regulators can rely on energy efficiency to meet specific pollutant reductions required under NAAQS, many states are missing out on this opportunity.
To understand why more states are not taking credit for what they are already doing, we conducted a survey of state air regulators. Responses varied, but a key barrier involved the complex nature of the electric grid and the movement of pollutants through the atmosphere. The air quality benefits of reducing pollution extend throughout the country, but the exact location of air quality improvements depends on many complex factors.
Modeling can be used to overcome this locational uncertainty. Using AVERT, an emissions quantification tool developed by EPA, we found that savings from energy efficiency can reduce pollution in 32 states with modeled federal air quality obligations. Looking further at Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas, pollutant reductions from energy efficiency savings showed up in areas that are currently or anticipated to be in nonattainment for three key pollutants: sulfur dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter (PM).
For example, in Texas our energy efficiency scenario resulted in multipollutant reductions in 14 geographic areas throughout the state. Texas could incorporate these reductions in its SIPs to help comply with NAAQS for three key pollutants and help with obligations under EPA’s Ozone and PM Advance Program.
Location of multipollutant reductions from energy efficiency scenario in Texas
While all states have energy efficiency programs and policies in place, their experiences with incorporating energy efficiency in SIPs have been limited, with costly consequences. Ignoring the multipollutant reduction benefits from energy efficiency means states must invest in potentially unnecessary control measures for reducing pollution.
Based on our survey of states and analysis of opportunities, we recommend several actions to further the role of energy efficiency as an air quality strategy for states. To help states evaluate the impact energy efficiency measures can have on SIP compliance, we suggest developing a tool or decision-making framework for making this assessment prior to investing the resources required for atmospheric modeling. In addition, states could benefit from a streamlined, EPA-acceptable approach for measuring and documenting outcomes of efficiency programs for inclusion in a SIP. We also suggest providing ongoing in-depth technical support. Although the value of energy efficiency as an air quality planning strategy is clear, further work is needed to incorporate energy efficiency into SIPs for NAAQS.
Join our webinar tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. ET to hear more insights on our report and learn about tools and other opportunities available for states to help meet air quality regulations.

Energy efficiency has a leading role to play in our distributed energy future;"The increased prevalence of distributed energy resources is driving changes to utility planning. Our new report, The Role of Energy Efficiency in a Distributed Energy Future, found that most utilities are not currently using energy efficiency in distribution system planning, but several states are pursuing new approaches to using efficiency to displace traditional distribution infrastructure upgrades and integrate more renewables into the grid. These states provide clear examples of how energy efficiency can be used as a resource on the distribution system. 
Energy Efficiency as a Distributed Energy Resource
The purpose of distributed resource planning processes is to integrate distributed energy resources into the grid and address other related issues such as rate design and valuation approaches. However there is no common definition of distributed energy resources. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners defines it as “a resource sited close to customers that can provide all or some of their immediate electric and power needs and can also be used by the system to either reduce demand or provide supply to satisfy the energy, capacity, or ancillary service needs of the distribution grid.” Our review of other definitions shows that most, but not all, include energy efficiency, which allows utilities and customers to cost effectively reduce energy needs and demand.
Utilities have been implementing energy efficiency as a resource for several decades and the benefits of efficiency are also well documented (here, here, and here). At the distribution level, energy efficiency may delay or avoid the need for new distribution infrastructure, and also reduce demand and energy needs at individual homes and businesses.
Current Practices and Leading States
To understand how utilities are considering energy efficiency in distribution system planning, we administered a survey to more than 30 utilities and reviewed active regulatory proceedings in key states. Our review found that while some utilities included energy efficiency savings in demand forecasts, most utilities are not using energy efficiency as a resource in distribution system planning. California and New York are still early in developing regulatory approaches to these issues, but are at the forefront of considering energy efficiency (and other distributed energy resources) in distributed planning.
New York, through the Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) proceeding, is attempting to create a marketplace of energy products and services for retail customers to optimize the level of distributed energy resources on the grid. While New York is still very early in the process, some aspects of REV have provided valuable insights on how energy efficiency can be used to delay the need for large-scale projects on the distribution system. The Brooklyn-Queens Demand Management (BQDM) Program is a useful case study of how ConEd is utilizing energy efficiency to reduce demand in a constrained area to delay a substation upgrade. The figure below shows the results of these efforts so far. The majority of demand reductions have been achieved through the implementation of several energy efficiency programs aimed at reducing demand in nearby buildings.

In California, the Public Utilities Commission is leading an effort to formalize several aspects of distributed resource planning. The state’s three largest utilities, San Diego Gas and Electric, Pacific Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison, are all implementing proof-of-concept projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of methods to estimate benefits of alterative resource portfolios and to validate the ability of projects to achieve these benefits. Southern California Edison’s demonstration project, known as the Preferred Resources Pilot, is using energy efficiency to reduce local demand and defer the need to upgrade a potentially constrained substation. As the figure below shows, Southern California Edison is relying on energy efficiency to meet a significant part of the demand reductions.
Figure 2. Acquired resources hypothetically operated serve the 2022 forecasted load. DG = distributed generation, DR = demand response, EE = energy efficiency, ES = energy storage, and PLS = permanent load shift. Source: Southern California Edison
Other states, such as Rhode Island, Washington State, Minnesota, Oregon, and Connecticut, are also engaged in efforts to value energy efficiency as a distributed resource and improve planning processes to consider alternative resources to building new distribution system infrastructure. Their progress should be monitored for best practices and case studies of how to value and incorporate energy efficiency into enhanced system planning.
Looking Ahead
The electric utility industry is in a period of fundamental change, which presents an opportunity to improve system planning processes to better incorporate energy efficiency. Our review of current practices and ongoing proceedings shows that most states are defining distributed energy resources to include energy efficiency but that most electric utilities are not using energy efficiency in distribution system planning. However, several leading states are providing useful information on methods of estimating locational and temporal value of energy efficiency in the context of distribution system planning.
These states are also providing valuable insights through demonstration projects designed to geographically target energy efficiency to achieve demand reductions. These efforts provide guidance to other states on how to best utilize energy efficiency as a distributed energy resource. Geographically targeted efficiency provides significant benefits and is a valuable complement to system-wide efficiency.  
As regulators and utilities work to modernize the distribution system and integrate distributed energy resources, energy efficiency should be a cornerstone in planning efforts. Efficiency can reduce utility system costs and enable the existing system to support more renewable energy while saving customers money.

What is resilience worth to you? A new metric could answer that question.;"Puerto Rico experienced another island-wide blackout last week. Distributed energy resources such as combined heat and power (CHP) could help communities avoid or minimize some impacts of large-scale natural disasters including blackouts. Our new white paper, Valuing Resilient Distributed Energy Resources: Combined Heat and Power and the Modern Grid, proposes a new metric to help decision makers better assess the costs of disruptive events and the value of critical resources including CHP.
What is energy resilience and what does it cost?
Energy resilience can be a critical indicator of an energy system’s performance. This report defines energy resilience as the ability of an energy system to withstand “high-consequence, low-probability” events and to regain normal operational activity after such events occur.
Extended power outages resulting from poor resilience can lead to lives lost at hospitals and huge economic losses for businesses. Several studies (e.g., see here, here and here) assess the scale of economic loss from poor energy performance, and most of the economy-wide assessments for the United States are well over $100 billion annually.
Combined Heat and Power: A Resilient System
However, CHP systems, onsite generation resources that generate both heat and power from one fuel input, can help keep the lights on. Typically, these systems are located closer to the site of energy consumption than traditional centralized generation, which means power moves over shorter distances, making it less likely that tree limbs or debris will fall on electric lines and interrupt power. They may also be able to fully disconnect from the surrounding grid, allowing them to respond quickly to changes in demand for power. In fact, most CHP systems are powered by natural gas and can often operate during power outages, as long as pipelines remain intact. What’s more, they are generally a more efficient way to generate necessary energy.
Even with these benefits, CHP still makes up only a small percentage of the energy infrastructure in the United States. This is in part because many facilities find it difficult to justify the investment economically, as the (possibly large) resilience benefits of CHP are not fully valued in project cost screening. In interviews with more than a dozen US insurance companies, we found that none of them offer products that explicitly reflect the reduced risk a facility using CHP might experience.
The Distributed Energy Resource Resilience Value (DERRV)
To capture the value of resilience, we propose a metric called the Distributed Energy Resource Resilience Value (DERRV) and provide a framework for how this metric could be developed. This metric would give decision makers the information they need to make informed risk calculations and determinations about impacts and costs.
Actionable information for a DERRV might include data on the reliability of the grid, the reliability of backup generators, costs of downtime, and CHP and microgrid performance and costs. Stakeholders involved in creating a DERRV should include CHP and microgrid developers and equipment manufacturers, customers concerned about energy risk (e.g., hospitals, data centers, first responder facilities, wastewater treatment plants), utilities, city and state policymakers and regulators, insurance companies, and investor representatives and advocates. Each of these stakeholders has a good deal to gain from increasing energy system resilience, and thus valuing it.
Moving toward a more resilient future
Some leading businesses and organizations are already integrating energy resilience and reliability data into actionable information for decision making. For example, reliability and specialty insurance provider Hartford Steam Boiler (HSB) developed a Blackout Risk Model that allows businesses to “predict the severity of business impacts” from outages and associated economic losses.
With a metric such as DERRV, more companies, critical facilities, cities, and states will be able to make informed decisions when building or rebuilding energy systems. That will help more facilities and communities improve their energy resilience, which reduces costs for everyone and may help keep the power on during severe weather events.

Boosting your home’s IQ delivers savings and improves comfort;"US homes can lower their energy use by up to one-sixth simply by incorporating smart technologies, according to our new report, Energy Impacts of Smart Home Technologies. In addition, these technologies — a combination of software, sensors, and hardware that monitor and control a home’s interior environment — allow homes to shift some of their energy use to times when energy demand and pricing are lowest. This pairing of energy savings and peak demand reduction is a win-win scenario for consumers and utilities alike.
In our report, we discuss several smart home technologies that serve the major home energy uses: HVAC, lighting, appliances, and plug loads. These smart systems use energy only where and when it is needed, making our homes smart and efficient.
Smart technologies deliver cost savings, energy savings, and comfort
An efficient smart home takes advantage of the interactions of technologies, which can work together to optimize their operation and share their status and data with one another. For example, a smart thermostat can signal smart window shades to let in more sunlight in the winter. The lighting then dims or turns off in response to the increase in daylight, while any solar heat gained through the windows may supplement the home’s heating needs. In short, smart technologies that target major end uses can change the picture of household energy consumption.
Of the technologies we explore in this report, smart thermostats are most prevalent —  11% of US households have one. Smart thermostats respond to occupancy, local weather conditions, and other inputs and use programming algorithms to seamlessly heat and cool the home. Smart thermostats can reduce the HVAC energy consumption of a typical household by 6–10% on average. Similar to smart thermostats, smart water heating controls can learn household patterns around hot water use.
Home energy management systems (HEMS) make it possible to control multiple systems in the home simultaneously. They can analyze the energy performance of these systems and provide feedback to residents through user-friendly interfaces, yielding energy savings of 5–22%; actual savings depend on which end uses are controlled.
Generating energy savings from smart technologies is not always straightforward, because each home is as unique as its residents. Consumer behavior plays a role in energy consumption, and energy savings depends on how each of us interacts with the smart devices in our homes.
The potential for retrofits
Smart home technologies can be particularly effective in retrofit programs. A smart home retrofit holds the promise for improved energy management when compared to a typical home that relies on manual inputs and often goes unmanaged. Many smart technologies are battery-powered and wireless, making them retrofit friendly. They can generate their own energy consumption data and provide real-time feedback on project performance. Contractors and service providers can then leverage these data to identify additional energy efficiency opportunities and educate residents about their energy use and influence their behavior.
Technology adoption is influenced by incentives…
Smart technologies may communicate with distributed energy resources and the power grid for demand-side management. Utilities are incentivizing these technologies through their energy efficiency and demand response programs, often by providing rebates and energy bill credits for participation in demand response events. Some utilities deploy time-of-use rate structures to provide incentives to customers who voluntarily curb their energy use during peak demand periods. Utilities and third-party service providers administer demand response programs and often create customized energy efficiency solutions for customers.
…and also by barriers
However not all consumers are rushing to install smart technology in their homes. Upfront purchase costs and the perceived complexity of smart technology are the leading barriers to investment. Some consumers are hesitant to install smart home technologies because of looming cybersecurity concerns. For some populations — those without internet access — the smart home is not yet a viable option.
Making smart technology more accessible
To realize the full potential of smart technologies, consumer acceptance must evolve beyond early adopters and reach the broader population. Some Americans have been quick to equip their homes with smart devices that enhance safety and privacy, and many appreciate the convenience of controlling their homes through voice commands and customized schedules. However there are few comprehensive studies documenting the performance of smart technologies in US homes. Increased efforts to more fully analyze and translate smart technology data into meaningful, actionable findings could prove useful to home performance and energy efficiency programs, leading to a smarter energy future for utilities, policymakers, and, ultimately, all of us.

A budding opportunity for energy efficiency;"This year’s 4/20, the high holiday of marijuana culture, comes at a time of robust growth for the cannabis industry. All puns aside, this growth underscores the industry’s need for energy efficiency. As the market develops in states like California, where recreational sales began in January, and Massachusetts, which follows suit in July, and as additional medical and recreational markets emerge around the country, energy efficiency can help reduce the energy use and pollution associated with cannabis cultivation, processing, and distribution facilities. The cannabis industry has expressed interest in efficiency’s other benefits, such as increasing market competitiveness and achieving sustainability.
Indoor cannabis cultivation is an energy intensive enterprise. Initial estimates suggest that the average cultivation facility uses 10 times as much energy, per square foot, as the typical office building. To successfully grow cannabis indoors, cultivators must recreate ideal outdoor climate conditions. Doing so requires significant energy to operate high-intensity lighting, HVAC, and dehumidification systems. Efficient equipment and practices (such as LED lighting and advanced HVAC systems) can slash energy use relative to traditional indoor cultivation techniques. However, outstanding questions remain about the most appropriate ways to cut energy use while maintaining optimal growing conditions.
There are no comprehensive national statistics on energy use in the cannabis industry, but data from states with legal commercial cultivation facilities are eye-opening. In Colorado, cannabis grow operations consume an estimated 300 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity per year—0.6% of the state’s total electricity consumption. In Denver, the hub of the state’s cannabis industry, roughly 4% of electricity demand comes from such indoor operations. In Washington State, energy loads from indoor cultivation are forecasted to grow from an estimated 80-102 average megawatts in 2014 (about 1% of total demand in Washington) to 180-300 average megawatts by 2035. Over just a six-month period in Portland, Oregon, Pacific Power reported at least seven power outages due to indoor cannabis cultivation.
In the coming years, the number of cannabis grow facilities is expected to grow substantially and energy use will grow along with it. As of mid-2018, commercial cannabis cultivation for medical purposes is legal in 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Eight states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) have legalized the cultivation of cannabis for recreational, adult-use markets, and numerous bills to legalize cannabis are under consideration in other states. Some state and local governments are exploring ways to incorporate energy and other sustainability requirements into cannabis industry regulations and permitting.
The lack of good energy data in cannabis cultivation facilities presents a challenge to policymakers, utilities, regulators, and researchers seeking to better understand and manage industry energy use. The ongoing federal prohibition on cannabis has created a gap in research and data collection normally carried out through federally-funded institutions and programs. This leaves it to states, NGOs, and industry to contribute the bulk of the scholarship and expertise needed to advance energy efficiency. New public and private initiatives aim to address these data issues and provide guidance to growers on how to boost efficiency. For example, the Resource Innovation Institute has developed the Cannabis PowerScore tool, which gives grower participants insights into their energy use while developing a robust dataset on energy use in cannabis cultivation facilities.
As cannabis industry expansion continues, ACEEE is exploring numerous paths for reducing the industry’s energy intensity. We are tracking best practices in facility design and operation, industry sustainability initiatives, and state and local policy development. We are partnering with the Resource Innovation Institute on initial scoping and fundraising efforts for a full market characterization study to document how energy is used in cannabis grow operations, identify the leading barriers and challenges to energy efficiency within the industry, and present the best opportunities for efficiency. Based on our findings, we will develop recommendations for cultivators, equipment suppliers, policymakers, utilities, and others with an interest in improving the industry’s energy efficiency.
Better data are critical. They can help develop energy use intensity baselines, create reliable estimates of the savings potential of efficiency measures, incorporate cannabis cultivation into energy demand forecasts, and develop a consensus on appropriate responses to the sector’s energy use. We hope our work will plant the seed for greater engagement of energy efficiency professionals in reducing the cannabis inudstry’s energy use .

How energy efficiency can boost resilience;"Extreme weather events and natural disasters such as bomb cyclones, forest fires, the polar vortex, and hurricanes are wreaking havoc on buildings, the electric grid, and other critical US infrastructure. Some communities are still struggling to rebuild from last year’s disasters, even as another hurricane season approaches. In the wake of these events, many people are asking: how can we make our systems more resilient?
This question is extremely important, but with no common definition of resilience, answers vary widely. Resilience is often viewed as a system’s ability to withstand and recover from serious events. This broad definition can be applied to an individual facility, an energy system, a city, economic activity, or even a region.
In several upcoming reports and blog posts, ACEEE will examine how energy efficiency intersects with the need for more resilient facilities, cities, electric grids, and other systems. Here’s a sneak preview of these new resources and how they fit together.
Community Resilience and Rebuilding
City planners are fundamentally concerned with reducing and responding to threats to their communities’ homes, hospitals, businesses, and transportation systems. This includes short- or long-term losses of power due to extreme weather. A 2015 ACEEE report looked at the resilience benefits of efficiency measures (see table below) and the ways that local resilience planners can incorporate them.
  Source: https://aceee.org/research-report/u1508
Energy efficiency can also play an important role in near-term post-disaster rebuilding plans. In a blog post coming in May, we will look at how efficient energy systems like combined heat and power (CHP), microgrids, and district energy systems can be part of rebuilding efforts to provide customers with reliable and affordable energy. We recommend that state and local policymakers recognize the benefits of energy-efficient measures and systems and do more to enable energy-efficient systems. At the federal level, Congress should update our disaster recovery strategy for long-term rebuilding with energy efficiency at its core.
Resilient Distributed Energy Resources
Later this month, we will release a new report, Valuing Distributed Energy Resources: Combined Heat and Power and the Modern Grid, that suggests ways stakeholders can do more to promote those systems. While we know that distributed energy resources are often more resilient than traditional generation infrastructure, they still make up only a small portion of the nation’s energy infrastructure. Our upcoming report will describe how facilities, communities, utilities, and others affected by poor energy resilience can better assess the costs of disruptive events and the benefits of mitigation strategies. We will also suggest a proposed framework for measuring the resilience value of distributed energy resources.
Grid Operations and Wholesale Energy Markets
In 2017, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) began a process to examine resilience in the utility sector. The agency turned down a US Department of Energy (DOE) proposal aimed at subsidizing nuclear and coal energy plants as baseload resources to improve the resilience of the US energy system. Instead, it asked grid operators to define resilience and identify issues that are threatening it. For grid operators, this discussion is both nuanced and technical. In particular, they must consider how reliability — a term that is clearly defined by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and comes with strict performance standards and requirements — fits into broader grid resilience. For example, grid operators and FERC are working on changes to wholesale energy markets, which are used to meet reliability requirements.
This summer, we will issue a report that examines efficiency’s role in maintaining grid reliability, including its performance in wholesale capacity markets and its use in response to electricity crises. Recognizing the value of efficiency for grid reliability is important within the national dialogue around our resource mix and resilience.
Federal agencies, state regulators, grid operators, cities, and other stakeholders are all grappling with how to define and manage system resilience. Energy efficiency plays a critical role at each of these levels, and our upcoming publications and blog posts aim to ensure that efficiency takes center stage in the discussion. Stay tuned!

No crystal ball necessary: energy efficiency can help mitigate price volatility;"Electricity bills don’t make for terribly exciting reading, but as boring as they may look, there is much more going on beneath the surface. Whereas the price most people pay for electricity remains steady from month to month, electricity costs can change dramatically from one hour to the next for the utilities that send the bills. For example, weather can cause demand to spike, raising prices as well, and suddenly the cost of the electricity is much different from the price we see on our bill. It generally falls on utilities to manage this problem, and in our new report, Estimating the Value of Energy Efficiency to Reduce Wholesale Energy Price Volatility, we estimate the costs of the risks that come with this kind of volatility and show how energy efficiency can play a useful role in mitigating those risks.
Utilities have to make plans several years at a time, setting electricity prices (with approval from regulators) to make sure they bring in enough money to cover their costs. They know that the weather is going to be bad at some point, but they don’t know when or how bad. One option is just to pay high prices when they come, hope that they set prices right, and ask permission from regulators to cover the difference if they’re wrong. Alternatively, utilities can essentially buy insurance by entering into long-term contracts for electricity at a fixed price, or by using financial markets, buying options on futures or other markets that don’t deliver actual electricity but rather pay the utility a certain amount of money if electricity prices rise above a particular level. However, the price for electricity in a long-term contract is generally higher than current expected prices, and financial instruments cost money to buy. If electricity prices don’t rise high enough, the utility loses money.
In general, utilities tend to do some of both, but regardless of what they do, volatility in electricity prices imposes costs on the system, and the only question is how much.
The polar vortex as an example
The 2013–2014 polar vortex shows how much this matters. In the PJM service territory that covers a large section of the mid-Atlantic states, electricity prices typically run in the range of $40 per megawatt hour (MWh). But during the polar vortex, prices jumped to over $100 per MWh and stayed there, spiking to over $1500 per MWh for a few hours. Utilities that had to buy power in real-time (or spot) markets were facing costs over 30 times higher than normal. Managing the risks of price volatility is an important business.
In our report, we calculated the value at risk to utilities from energy price volatility for the 12-month period including the polar vortex (June 2013–May 2014) and again for the 12 months following. Looking at the day-ahead electricity market, we found that in the year of the vortex, price volatility created risk of as much as 25% of electricity costs. This means that if a utility knew the polar vortex was going to occur at some point in that year, they should have been willing to pay up to 25% extra over the entire year to avoid having to buy electricity on the day-ahead market. We also looked at the following year which had much more normal weather, and while the cost of risk was lower, it still averaged a substantial 14% of the wholesale cost of electricity over the entire year.
Efficiency can reduce exposure to price volatility and risk
Energy efficiency has many well-recognized and understood benefits: it is generally less expensive than electricity itself, it reduces pollution, and increases comfort. Investing in energy efficiency creates more jobs than producing the electricity it replaces. In addition to these and other benefits, energy efficiency also reduces exposure to electricity price volatility, reducing risk and its attendant costs.
Well-designed efficiency investments act similarly to long-term supply contracts. Once the investment is made, it saves energy over its useful life, and the price doesn’t go up and down with wholesale electricity prices. Every kilowatt-hour (kwh) of saved electricity is one less kwh that has to be bought on volatile wholesale markets or long-term contracts, or that has to be hedged through financial instruments.
Instead of buying electricity and the cost of mitigating risk on top of it, when utilities invest in energy efficiency, they avoid the costs of risk and pay less for the underlying electricity in the first place, a double benefit that utilities and other planners should be sure to include when making long-term decisions about how to provide critical services to their customers. Given that some extreme weather events are likely to become both more common and more extreme, it will be increasingly important to recognize this feature of energy efficiency and use efficiency investments to manage this growing risk.

Lights Out for Residential Lighting Programs? Not Just Yet;"LED light bulbs have transitioned from a fledgling technology to a major market player in recent years, with more than 450 million installed nationwide as of 2016. With Americans increasingly choosing LEDs, and federal standards set to increase efficiency levels for general service lamps (the most common type of screw-in light bulbs) in January 2020, many utilities and regulators are wondering whether it is time to leave residential lighting programs behind as they plan for the coming 2019–2021 program years.
Do the upcoming standards mean residential lighting programs will no longer be cost-effective? Or can programs gain another year or two of savings by promoting efficient light bulbs, which have long been the mainstay of residential program portfolios? These questions are at the forefront of utility program planning and regulatory agendas in many states. We find that for 2019, utility programs can achieve savings in most states by continuing to run programs for the full range of LED lamps. But the picture is more complicated for 2020 and 2021, and regional differences will also matter.
LEDs are gaining ground, but the race is not over
Overall, according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, LED lamps accounted for 36% of national light bulb sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, while halogen lamps still held 48% of market share. While the growth in LED market share is promising, these LEDs are largely displacing CFLs. The market share of halogens and conventional incandescents—both of which are much less efficient—has held steady, hovering close to 50% of sales since the end of 2014.
LED adoption varies across the states and even within states depending largely on the presence of successful lighting programs and the mix of retailers. For example, state standards are accelerating the transition even further in California. The map below shows LED market share by census region and highlights the striking differences across the country. Many states still haven’t reached 20%, while a small number of leading states have exceeded 40%.

Even in states where LED market share is already high (greater than 40%), continued investment in residential lighting programs is critical. Early evidence from New York and Massachusetts suggests that LED adoption slows when program activity is scaled back, arguing for continued promotion rather than premature retreat. Targeted programs that address specialty products may be a good fit for these states. For others, there are still cost-effective opportunities for utilities—if not for a full three-year program cycle, at least for a portion of the cycle.
What a difference a year makes
For many states, 2019 looks very much like 2018 or 2017.  New federal standards have yet to take effect and consumers continue to find a wide range of inefficient halogen and specialty incandescent lamps on store shelves. For 2020, the situation is much less clear. When the new standards come into effect on January 1, 2020 it will no longer be legal to sell most halogen and incandescent light bulbs, but there are several factors that could affect the initial implementation of the standard:
Legal uncertainty: While there is still some legal uncertainty regarding implementation of the 2020 standard, ACEEE and others are fairly confident the new 45 lumens per watt (lpw) standard will go into effect.
Sales prohibition: Unlike other federal standards, the federal backstop language triggering the lamp standard prohibits all sales of non-complying products as of the effective date. Virtually all other federal standards apply to the manufacture or import of products rather than sales, allowing for a transition period as retailers are allowed to sell their remaining stock of non-compliant products. This unique provision shifts enforcement to retail, creating uncertainty about the specifics and rigor of the enforcement process.
Product categories: The original standards for general service lamps enacted in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), along with the 2020 backstop provision, covered the most common screw-based lamps. DOE has since expanded the definition and extended coverage to many lamps that were originally exempted from standards.
Rather than pre-determining the final fate of programs while the transition plays out, programs should take more of a “wait and see” approach. Program administrators should closely track market conditions in their territory and make final program decisions for 2020 in the fall of 2019, and hold off on final decisions for 2021 until the fall of 2020. By 2021, we expect that many of these transition issues will be resolved, and as the market shift to LEDs progresses throughout the country, it is likely that residential lighting programs will no longer be cost-effective beyond 2021. The residential lighting market will have transformed from an incumbent technology, largely unchanged for more than 100 years, to an entirely new technology with unprecedented speed—a major energy efficiency success story.
Program opportunities
In the near-term, utility programs can achieve savings in most states by continuing to run LED promotions and incentives for the full range of LED lamps. There are also promising near- and mid-term opportunities for residential lighting programs, especially in states where LED sales are relatively high. Options include:
Underserved markets: While national home improvement and hardware chains offer a robust mix of LED products and boast strong sales, a 2017 Consumer Federation of America study found smaller independent, grocery, and discount stores are less likely to stock and promote a range of LEDs. This is particularly true for those serving rural and lower-income urban neighborhoods. Programs can find additional savings by targeting rural, elderly, and low-income market segments that have been slower to adopt LEDs.
Specialty lamps: Manufacturers have introduced LED versions of the most popular styles of specialty lamps including decorative, candelabra, globe, and reflector lamps, but market share for these lamps continues to significantly underperform general purpose LED lamps.
High quality lamps: An increasing number of “value” LED lamps are hitting the market, but while they boast similar efficiency to ENERGY STAR®-qualified lamps, they are typically shorter-lived and do not meet the quality and performance criteria required for ENERGY STAR certification.  Programs should consider continuing to promote high performance ENERGY STAR branded products.
Controls: Dimming and occupancy controls offer additional savings opportunities. Programs should consider promoting quality control solutions that are easy to install and operate to assure consumer acceptance and persistence.
Beyond lighting 
While there is still some life left in residential lighting programs, most of these programs will end in a few years. Programs must turn their attention to new opportunities to expand and diversify their residential efficiency programs. ACEEE has identified a number of promising opportunities that can help fill the gap left by lighting programs. Smart technologies, including smart thermostats, offer a new area for energy savings. Other opportunities include advanced HVAC and water-heating technologies (including improved HVAC installation and maintenance), efficient and better-controlled plug loads, and more. Energy efficiency has a leading role to play in providing targeted, low-cost savings in a distributed energy future.

EPA fails to do its homework on light-duty standards;"The “final determination” on light-duty vehicle standards recently issued by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Scott Pruitt has all the hallmarks of a bad book report. Despite the complexity of the subject matter, the formal rejection of the Obama-era greenhouse gas standards for model years 2022-2025 does not draw on an ounce of new EPA analysis.
The new determination is the sorry conclusion of a mandatory midterm evaluation process that the EPA, the US Department of Transportation, and the California Air Resources Board kicked off in 2016 with a 1,200-page draft Technical Assessment Report (TAR). The TAR contains a rigorous analysis of technologies that could be applied to improve vehicles’ fuel economy and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by model year 2025, as well as extensive discussions of consumer acceptance of those technologies and the economic and safety impacts of the standards. The TAR draws from extensive agency technical work: EPA alone contributed multiple vehicle “tear-down” studies to estimate technology costs, extensive benchmarking of engines and transmissions using 20 production vehicles, 15 Society of Automotive Engineers technical papers, and comprehensive vehicle fuel economy simulation in-house models. This was the technical basis for an earlier determination, issued in January 2017, that the model year 2022–2025 standards were appropriate. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, meanwhile, presented no new work in support of his reversal of the finding on April 2.
Indeed, the new determination appears to have been drafted by someone who has not read the TAR—and watched only the first 10 minutes of the movie. The document consists of 38 pages of uncritically recycled statements from parties seeking to weaken the standards, interspersed with brief mentions of opposing arguments. How this leads to a conclusion that the standards are not appropriate is left to the reader’s imagination. Here are some of our (least) favorite excerpts:
[T]he projections for fuel cost savings in the 2012 rule may have been optimistic, which increases the challenge manufacturers face in making fuel-efficient vehicles attractive to consumers. This consideration supports EPA’s determination that the current standards are inappropriate and should be reconsidered in a new rulemaking (p.27).
The TAR used 2016 price projections from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), which are very close to current projections. And it’s important to keep in mind that vehicle standards are most important when fuel prices are low: the standards ensure manufacturers keep improving vehicles, so that consumers and automakers are less vulnerable when prices climb back up. Let’s avoid a repeat of the domestic industry bailouts of 2009-2013.  
EPA also recognizes that there is significant uncertainty both in the pace of development of these technologies and in the degree of efficiency improvements they will ultimately be able to deliver (p.19).
Many of the technologies in question, including mild hybridization, lightweighting, and continuously variable transmissions are entering the market more quickly than anticipated. The standards promote consistent investment in efficiency technologies, which is key to the vibrancy and sustainability of the auto industry.  Regarding technologies’ efficiency improvements, this was the core of the TAR; that analysis was solid but conservative.
The Administrator believes that affordability of new cars across the income spectrum, and especially among low-income consumers, is an important factor… (p.24).
A recent study found that lower-income consumers will benefit most from the savings the standards deliver, both in new cars and eventually in the used cars they more frequently purchase. The uninformed airing of such concerns by an administrator not known for frugal use of taxpayer dollars is especially galling.
Mitsubishi expressed concern that it would have to add electrification to already efficient low-priced vehicles and the increased price could drive buyers to less efficient used vehicles (p.25).
Mitsubishi, the company that cheated on fuel economy tests in Japan for 25 years? While it hasn’t been a big player in the US market, Mitsubishi aims to change that. The company stands to benefit if US manufacturers lag on fuel efficiency technology as auto markets around the world tighten standards.
[U]sing GHG emission standards as criteria pollutant control measures is likely a less efficient mechanism to decrease criteria pollutants and those issues are already handled through the NAAQS implementation processes (p.29).
Dismissing air pollution as an issue “already handled” by other processes shortchanges EPA’s mission of protecting human health and the environment. Reductions in oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter are significant co-benefits of the standards. 
[I]ndustry cannot effectively plan for compliance with the current MY 2022-2025 GHG standards until it knows the outcome of the upcoming NHTSA rulemaking for MY 2022-2025 CAFE standards (p.35).
The final determination acknowledges the importance of a stable regulatory environment so that manufacturers’ multi-year product plans are not disrupted. Yet the action destabilizes that environment by interrupting a long upward trajectory of fuel economy set in motion under George W. Bush in 2007 and operationalized under Barack Obama. Changing standards today for model year 2022 would be disruptive in any case, but the fact is that such a move will be stuck in court for years to come. Going after the many states that have chosen more stringent standards, as the administrator is now threatening, will only make matters worse.
These are but a few of the misrepresentations regarding vehicle emissions standards in the new final determination. The administrator seems undeterred by the outrage caused by his earlier citing of an amateurish study in rolling back standards for “glider” trucks and is now pulling a similar stunt in the high-profile and high-stakes arena of light-duty vehicle standards. While auto manufacturers have played a highly counterproductive role in the process, more forward-looking industry players and other voices of reason should seek to redirect this process before the EPA takes another next step to roll back vehicle standards.

Buying an efficient home is about to get easier in Massachusetts;"Home buyers in Massachusetts may soon be able to better gauge the energy efficiency, or inefficiency, of their potential future homes. On Tuesday, Governor Charlie Baker introduced legislation that would establish energy performance ratings and disclosure requirements for homes across the state.
Tuesday’s proposal is the latest addition to a suite of successful policies undertaken by the state. Massachusetts has topped ACEEE’s State Energy Efficiency Scorecard for the past seven years, buoyed by strong utility policies, building energy codes, and state-led energy efficiency programs. But with California and Rhode Island nipping at its heels, the Bay State isn’t resting on its laurels. Instead, it’s working to integrate energy efficiency more deeply into its economy.
The legislation calls for the development of an energy scorecard, which would include a performance rating that must be disclosed to potential buyers of residential properties. The legislation also calls for a number of features to support implementation of the energy scorecard system, including trainings for home assessors, real estate professionals, and lenders.
By building energy performance information into residential real estate transactions, Massachusetts could significantly increase energy efficiency investments in existing homes, as many new homeowners look to make home improvements just after purchase. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies found that households that moved within the past three years spent about one-third more on home improvements than otherwise similar non-movers. Additionally, research has found that home energy rating systems can help demonstrate the value of home energy efficiency measures, leading 12-37% of home buyers to make recommended upgrades.
Currently, cities tend to lead the way when it comes to energy benchmarking and transparency policies for private buildings. ACEEE’s most recent City Energy Efficiency Scorecard identified 17 cities with residential or commercial benchmarking policies in place. Boston is one city tackling efficiency by making energy performance information on large commercial buildings public. Since 2016, Boston’s Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure ordinance has required that all buildings greater than 35,000 square feet in the city benchmark and report their energy and water use.
Portland, Oregon and Berkeley, California both have policies requiring that home energy ratings be provided when a home is listed for sale (Portland) or when the sale closes (Berkeley). Chicago, meanwhile, has a voluntary program to disclose energy bills to potential purchasers and has found that homes that provide this information sell more quickly and for a higher percentage of their asking price. In Europe, such policies are common and evaluations find that homes with higher ratings sell for 1-5% more than unrated homes.
Meanwhile, fewer than ten states have any sort of energy transparency policies in place, and the depth of these policies varies greatly. Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Maine require the disclosure of energy efficiency information at the time of lease or sale of residential properties. California and Washington, along with the District of Columbia, are the only states to require benchmarking and disclosure of energy usage information for private commercial buildings.
By integrating energy efficiency information into the residential housing market, Massachusetts can help homebuyers ensure that one of the largest purchases they may ever make is also smart and comfortable.

ACEEE Denounces Imminent EPA Rejection of Commonsense Light-Duty Standards;"Statement by Therese Langer, ACEEE Transportation Program director
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Scott Pruitt is expected to throw automotive progress in reverse by declaring that light-duty vehicle standards for model years 2022-2025 are no longer appropriate. Such a determination would be in direct conflict with the agency’s mission to protect human health and the environment, and with the administration’s promises of economic prosperity and a resurgence in domestic manufacturing. The agency has offered no new evidence that would support a decision to jettison years of rigorous and comprehensive analysis that has repeatedly demonstrated the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the standards. EPA’s action would pave the way for a regulatory rollback in the coming months.
Putting the brakes on these standards would be a costly mistake with long-lasting economic and environmental impacts. In giving their tacit support to the move, domestic automakers could ultimately undermine their own competitiveness globally, as they are facing similar or more stringent standards in major markets around the world. If US manufacturers lag in developing the fuel-saving technologies that  global markets demand, it could adversely affect our exports, as well as provide an opening for additional imports of more fuel-efficient vehicles the next time fuel prices spike.
ACEEE estimates that by 2035, the standards in question would save more than 10.4 billion gallons of gasoline annually. Even with today’s relatively low gas price projections, the owner of an average 2025 vehicle would save more than $1,000 dollars over the vehicle’s lifetime, due to fuel savings that far exceed the upfront cost of making the vehicle more efficient. These are on top of the major savings accruing from the program already, under standards in place through model year 2021.
The nation would be best served by steady advances in vehicle efficiency and emissions standards that save Americans money at the pump, reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions, and keep our auto industry relevant both here and abroad.

Award-winning programs improve health and cut energy waste;"In a promising trend that connects health and energy, a rising number of organizations have launched initiatives within the past 10 years to mitigate indoor health risks while reducing energy waste. Our new report, The Next Nexus: Exemplary Programs that Save Energy and Improve Health, recognizes the best by announcing the six winners of the new Health and Energy Linked Programs (HELP) Award.
Their work is invaluable because the buildings we live and work in have a direct effect on our health. Air pollution from power plants, allergens such as pollen, and cold and hot air can all find their way into homes, workplaces, and schools where they can exacerbate a host of health problems ranging from asthma to heart disease.
The HELP Award recognizes exemplary programs in this space and highlights their innovative practices and program design.
The 2017 HELP Award Honorees are:
Overall Excellence: The Zero Energy Modular (ZEM) Program builds zero net energy modular homes in Vermont using materials that are better for human health than traditional building materials.
Overall Excellence: The Green & Healthy Homes Initiative (GHHI) Asthma Reduction Program, headquartered in Baltimore, addresses the connection between unhealthy housing and occupant health through education and energy efficiency.
Overall Excellence: The Bronx Healthy Buildings Program — named for the New York City borough it’s based in — works with tenants and property owners in multifamily buildings to improve residents’ energy savings, health, and safety.
Innovative: SystemVisionTM builds new homes and offers guarantees for heating and cooling energy use and comfort in North Carolina.
Uplifting Communities: Serving Philadelphia neighborhoods, EnergyFIT Philly seeks to cut energy costs and improve the quality of home health and safety through weatherization, education, and bill payment assistance.
Reach: Vermont One Touch collaborates with several government agencies to assist low-income residents throughout the state with energy upgrades, education, and health and social services.
We solicited nominations from across the country and convened a group of public health and energy efficiency experts to judge the 49 programs nominated, nearly 80% of which were founded since 2008. The advisors selected six programs to receive four awards. Programs were recognized based on their reach, replicability, sustainability of funding, innovative techniques, lasting sector improvements, and significant energy savings and health outcomes.
Programs are employing a variety of innovative techniques to maximize their impact. For example, partnerships with local government agencies and community-based organizations result in a broader reach and greater access to resources. Additionally most programs performed pre-intervention audits or assessments. However, while many programs demonstrated the ability to assess energy impacts, many do not evaluate, measure, or verify health outcomes of their interventions in a meaningful way, despite publicly stated goals.
By developing collaborative, innovative, and sustainable health and energy linked programs that measure both energy and health impacts, program managers can substantially reduce energy waste, increase cost savings, and improve health for communities across the country. We will highlight the main themes of this report and discuss the full range of ACEEE’s Health & Environment work at our first Conference on Health, Environment, and Energy, to be held in New Orleans in December.

The path to fuel economy is clear, even with truck sales in high gear;"The Trump administration appears to be nearing a decision to roll back light-duty fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards. Automakers have promoted this reckless action by claiming that the standards are too tough now that consumers are buying larger vehicles, which typically use more fuel. Indeed, car sales have fallen over the past few years, while sales of light trucks — which include SUVs, minivans, pickups, and all-wheel-drive crossovers — have grown.
However the standards were designed to accommodate shifts in the market. Every vehicle sold in a given model year has a unique fuel economy target based on its size and whether it’s a car or truck. For example, a typical mid-size sedan meeting its 2025 fuel economy target will get about 41 miles per gallon in real-world driving, while a full-size pickup truck meeting its 2025 target will get about 26 miles per gallon. Furthermore not every vehicle a manufacturer sells has to meet its own fuel economy target, because a manufacturer’s overall fuel economy requirement is based on the sales-weighted average fuel economy target of all vehicles that it sells.
Consequently the current truck boom does not make the standards any more difficult to meet. Increased truck sales simply mean lower overall fuel economy targets for the manufacturers. In fact the truck standards are less demanding in relative terms; the rate of fuel economy improvements required for cars currently exceeds the rate for trucks. The most striking example is full-size pickup trucks, whose targets are set to increase very little between 2016 and 2020 (figure 1). Regulators went easy on pickups when they adopted the standards in 2012 to give automakers extra time to invest in fuel-saving technologies for these vehicles.
Percent increase in fuel economy targets for a car and a full-size pickup, model years 2012-2025
In the coming weeks, we’ll be homing in on this highly profitable segment of the vehicle market — one that is vital to domestic automakers — to understand what manufacturers have been doing with that extra time. We’ll take stock of recent fuel economy and technology changes for each major pickup line to find out whether manufacturers are delivering the cost-effective efficiency improvements that can save Americans thousands of dollars at the pump. Are manufacturers adopting the technologies identified by the agencies when they set the standards, and are the technologies delivering the expected fuel efficiency improvements? Or are these technologies being used for other purposes? For example, the 2018 Ford F-150  deploys fuel-saving technologies such as multiple fuel injectors and 10-speed transmissions, but the technology has also provided a considerable boost in power and torque as well – possibly at the expense of larger fuel economy gains.  We’ll share our findings in future posts.
In the meantime, watch for the administration’s next move on the standards. Rolling back fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards might look like a gift to automakers, but it would come at the expense of the future of the domestic auto industry and American consumers. By contrast, leaving the standards in place would support the global competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers, create jobs at home, and protect Americans’ health and financial well-being.

Good News: Congress Stands Up for Energy Efficiency with Omnibus Bill;"Statement by Lowell Ungar, ACEEE Senior Policy Advisor
Washington, DC— The 2018 omnibus spending bill is good news for energy efficiency. The bill, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, disregards the draconian cuts proposed by the administration and instead upholds or increases investments in many federal programs that help consumers and businesses save energy. That means more money in Americans’ wallets, a better bottom line for American businesses, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and a healthier US economy.
Overall, the bill increases funding for energy efficiency programs at the US Department of Energy (DOE) and maintains funding levels for efficiency programs at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Specifically, the bill maintains current funding levels for ENERGY STAR®, as well as SmartWay and other voluntary programs that give consumers and businesses the information they need to select energy-efficient products. EPA’s Ann Arbor laboratory, where all vehicle certification testing and standards development occurs, also appears to be level-funded.
DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will see an overall increase of 11%, with a bump in funding for almost all of the program offices. The Advanced Manufacturing Office (which includes the Industrial Assessment Centers) will see an 18% increase, while the Building Technologies and Vehicle Technologies Offices will each receive 10% more funding for FY18. The legislation also includes 10% increases for the Weatherization Assistance Program, which helps low-income families and seniors make home improvements that improve energy efficiency and health, and the State Energy Program, which helps state governments make critical energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy security investments.
We are encouraged to see that Congress recognizes the value of these key energy efficiency programs. The bill does cut DOE’s Equipment and Building Standards Program, which saves families nearly $500 on their energy and water bills each year, by 7% (it also includes the Building Energy Codes Program). However the lack of support by the administration for implementing these programs (including statutory obligations) is a much bigger problem. We strongly hope that Congress continues to support both of these programs. With consistent investments in these critical programs, Congress can ensure that energy efficiency continues to cut energy waste, create jobs, drive economic growth, and save money for American families and businesses.

Iowa bills threaten to roll back energy efficiency, putting consumer savings at risk;"With a critical vote coming as soon as Monday, Iowa is at an important crossroads as legislative efforts threaten to scale back energy efficiency. In recent weeks, legislators have introduced bills that would deprive homes and businesses of valuable programs that keep energy costs down, create jobs, reduce pollution, and defer construction on costly and excessive energy generation. While some attacks have been unsuccessful, Senate File 2311, which days ago passed out of a Senate committee, poses the greatest threat. The bill would significantly weaken established efficiency programs and possibly eliminate the requirement that utilities provide these programs to customers.
A history of success
Iowa first began requiring its utilities to offer energy efficiency programs under legislation passed in 1990. In 2008 the state legislature and Iowa Utilities Board strengthened these efforts by extending the requirement to municipal utilities and cooperatives and directing investor-owned utilities (IOU) to increase annual savings. Since then, utilities have saved 400,000 – 500,000 MWh from newly installed energy efficiency measures each year, and these savings add up over time. According to an Energy Futures Group analysis, since 2009 efficiency programs implemented by MidAmerican and Interstate Power & Light have provided approximately 10% of customers’ total annual electricity needs and produced lifetime savings equal to five years of total residential electricity consumption. For every $1 spent on electric energy efficiency programs in Iowa, residents and businesses have reaped $2 in benefits.
Future energy and cost savings in jeopardy
Iowa legislators have proposed bills that would drastically weaken the efficiency programs utilities provide to their customers. If the bills pass, customers can expect rebates for smart thermostats, energy-saving appliances, and home energy audits to be scaled back (or even eliminated altogether), despite public polls showing 97% of Iowans support increasing energy efficiency, and 82% support requiring utilities to increase investment in energy efficiency. The legislation would also deal a heavy blow to the 20,000 Iowans working in the energy efficiency sector and directly undermine one of the key objectives of Iowa’s recently published statewide Energy Plan — to promote widespread adoption of energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Rolling back efficiency efforts is also at odds with the findings of a September 2017 energy efficiency potential study completed for the Iowa Utilities Association, which determined that 17% of electricity use and 15% of gas use in the state could be saved cost-effectively through efficiency programs over the next decade. While MidAmerican’s goal to provide 100% renewable energy to its customers provides vital leadership toward a clean energy future, efficiency must remain a key pillar of this clean energy future. Saving energy complements efforts to shift toward renewable energy in important ways, such as by reducing energy demand, giving customers control over their consumption and costs, and reducing the investment required to meet the renewable energy goal.
Senate File 2311 (formerly SSB 3093) would effectively eliminate all funding for utility energy efficiency programs and allow future funding for programs only if customers voluntarily paid into the energy efficiency fund. (Imagine if utilities could pay for a power plant only if customers volunteered to do so!) Other weakening efforts include an arbitrary cap limiting efficiency and demand response expenditures to no more than 2% of an electric customer’s bill or 1.5% of a gas customer’s bill. This cap would prevent utilities from investing in a low-cost resource, even if investing in energy efficiency is a better deal for customers than any alternative resource. The bill would also change the state’s procedures for determining cost-effectiveness of programs, eliminating any consideration of the long-term societal benefits that energy efficiency provides to customers.
Meanwhile Senate Study Bill 3078, which remains in subcommittee, would eliminate the requirement that utilities offer efficiency programs. House Study Bill 595 would enable large industrial customers to opt out of energy efficiency programs altogether, allowing them to reap the grid and societal benefits of efficiency while shifting the associated costs to businesses and homeowners. While HSB 595 did not advance out of committee, its provisions could be resurrected in future bills. 
Iowa should expand access, rather than eliminating savings
Iowa legislators should be examining ways to increase energy efficiency and expand access to underserved customers, rather than looking for ways to eliminate efficiency programs that help Iowans save energy and money. The state’s current efficiency standard allows small public utilities and cooperatives to set only voluntary goals, meaning rural customers and others outside IOU service territories remain underserved by efficiency programs and miss out on the roughly $325 million in net benefits these programs produce each year. But rather than address this inequity, the legislation would further weaken efficiency reporting requirements for these smaller utilities and send a damaging ripple effect throughout the economy by dismantling programs that create local jobs and keep dollars in consumers’ pockets.
How to increase savings, instead of increasing bills
Detractors have sought to characterize efficiency spending as a hidden and gratuitous fee. While it is true that a surcharge funds these programs directly, they eliminate energy waste in homes and businesses, leading to energy bill savings by reducing consumption and the need for grid investment. This longstanding approach to energy efficiency in Iowa — and states around the country — is guided by the simple reality that the cheapest energy is generally the energy we don’t use.
Iowa utilities should follow the example of neighboring utilities, like Xcel in Minnesota. Xcel recognizes the benefits of energy efficiency, investing in efficiency even while Minnesota customer electricity bills are 14th lowest in the country. Analysis released last week by the Energy Information Administration shows that electric expenditures for Iowa customers are also below the national average, ranking the state 17th cheapest compared to other states. The low energy bills in both Iowa and Minnesota can be credited in part to energy efficiency. As ACEEE and others have found, energy efficiency is a low-cost energy resource, providing electricity at an average cost of 3 cents per kWh to help keep rates low.
By looking to the success of its neighbors and other states that have found ways to design stronger, more inclusive programs that bring additional customers into the fold, Iowa has an opportunity to build on its success rather than open the door to more energy waste. If keeping customer costs low is truly the driving goal of Iowa’s energy utilities, energy efficiency should remain a key strategy.

Save Energy, Protect Health: How Energy Efficiency Can Prevent 30,000 Asthma Attacks Each Year;"Washington, DC—Saving energy can reduce the number of asthma attacks and other harmful health effects of air pollution from power plants, according to Saving Energy, Saving Lives: The Health Impacts of Avoiding Power Plant Pollution with Energy Efficiency, a pioneering new report released by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) and Physicians for Social Responsibility that looks at the impact of energy efficiency on US states and cities. In fact, reducing annual electricity use by 15% nationwide would save more than six lives every day, prevent nearly 30,000 asthma episodes each year, and save Americans up to $20 billion through avoided health harms annually.
Here's how: When people and businesses save energy, less energy needs to be produced; the result is less power plant pollution. The money saved by reducing this pollution and the harmful health effects it causes would be enough to pay the annual health insurance premiums for nearly 3.6 million families, according to the report.
“The health effects of power plant pollution are well known, and our new research shows where energy efficiency can produce the most substantial public health benefits by reducing that pollution,” said Sara Hayes, ACEEE program manager for health and environment. “Wind patterns, the complexity of the electric grid, and other variables influence where health benefits crop up. This means that public health benefits will be greatest when cities and states work together to reduce energy waste.”
“The health benefits available from energy efficiency are impressive,” said Barbara Gottlieb, director for environment and health at Physicians for Social Responsibility. “Air pollution from power plants contributes to four of the leading causes of death in the United States: cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, heart disease, and stroke. We can use energy efficiency to save lives and help slow global warming. Those benefits are going to be felt now and for decades into the future.”
Specifically, Saving Energy, Saving Lives examines the potential avoided health harms — including heart attacks, respiratory illnesses and symptoms, premature deaths, and emergency room visits to treat asthma — that could be achieved with a 15% reduction in electricity use across the country. Using two US Environmental Protection Agency modeling tools to identify how much pollution would be avoided and to estimate potential health impacts, the report ranks states and the 50 largest cities by their potential health benefits.
Our ranking of cities, based on the dollar value of avoided health harms, shows that New York City would see the greatest benefits — more than $1 billion in avoided health harms — over a one-year period, followed by Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Detroit. Washington, DC, Cleveland, and the Dallas-Fort Worth area are next on the list, with Cincinnati and Atlanta rounding out the top ten.
In US$, potential avoided health harms in top 15 cities(low and high range) resulting from 15% reduction in electricity use
In US$, potential avoided health harms in top 15 cities(low and high range) resulting from 15% reduction in electricity use
The dollar value of avoided health harms would average more than $70 per person in 15 cities across the country, with Pittsburgh seeing the greatest per capita benefits — more than $200 per person on average.
Some of the greatest opportunities are in the upper Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Southern United States. Our ranking of states shows that Pennsylvania would see the greatest aggregate health benefits from a 15% reduction in annual electricity use, followed by New York and Ohio. Illinois, Texas, Michigan, Florida, Indiana, Tennessee, and North Carolina round out the top ten. West Virginia would see the greatest benefits per person — $184 on average.
Overall our analysis reveals an opportunity to significantly improve public health using energy efficiency. The benefits described in the report are based on the pollution avoided in a single year, but an energy efficiency measure typically results in energy savings over many years, meaning emissions would also be avoided year after year. Proven strategies such as energy efficiency resource standards, building energy codes, and appliance standards can produce these benefits.

As federal efforts lag, states are picking up the slack on appliance standards;"With a little more than a year elapsed since President Trump’s inauguration, progress on federal appliance standards has slowed to a crawl, while state efforts are picking up steam. Although the administration affirmed or completed several important Obama-era standards during its first months, others remain in limbo. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has now missed multiple legal deadlines and, in December, released a regulatory plan that puts the government on track to miss many more in 2018 and beyond. State policy makers have not wasted any time stepping into the breach; this year is already shaping up as a big one for state standards. 
Status of standards at risk
With President Trump and Congress both focused on cutting regulations, 2017 opened with all eleven standards finalized during the last year of the Obama administration on the chopping block. Some good news: seven of these standards are now safe from rollbacks and efforts to protect the other four are underway. Here’s the rundown:
Manufacturers, consumer groups, and environmental advocates all urged preservation of four major standards developed through the negotiated rulemaking process. In spring 2017, after reviewing public input, the administration affirmed new standards for central air conditioners and heat pumps, beverage coolers, swimming pool pumps, and walk-in coolers.
Three standards developed through the more common, non-negotiated rulemaking process were on some target lists for repeal by Congress. But deadlines for Congressional repeal passed with no action to remove the new standards for ceiling fans, battery chargers, and dehumidifiers.
Four other standards remain in limbo. Although signed and issued in late 2016, final standards must wait 45 days for publication in the Federal Register to allow stakeholders to identify errors, and this error-correction period spanned the change in administrations. The only error correction request filed was non-substantive, yet a year later the Trump administration has still not officially published standards for portable air conditioners, air compressors, commercial boilers, and uninterruptible power supplies.
In mid-2017, state attorneys general and consumer and environmental groups sued DOE to compel publication of the four standards in limbo. In addition several states are considering their own standards for some of these products. More on that below.
According to DOE’s analyses, the eleven standards combined will save consumers and businesses about $30–75 billion over 30 years, even after taking into account DOE’s estimated impact on up-front product prices.
Forward DOE progress slows
Although DOE did advance some work in 2017 — for example, initiating several test procedure reviews — it had missed eight legal deadlines for reviewing standards by the end of the year. Then, in December, DOE quietly released a regulatory plan that moved work on 20 standards and 17 test procedures to “long-term action” status, meaning the agency had no plans to work on these within the next year. Beyond 2018 DOE listed the plan for nearly every item as simply “TBD.”
Missing deadlines violates the fundamental compact between states and the federal government enshrined in the national appliance standards law. National standards generally preempt state standards, with some narrow exceptions. But in taking over responsibility for efficiency standards from the states, Congress tasked DOE with keeping the standards up to date. DOE must review each existing standard at least once every six years and determine if improved standards are “technologically feasible and economically justified.” If DOE finds that a revision is warranted, a final rule is due two years later.
DOE last fell behind on so many deadlines during the mid-2000s. Congress initiated oversight and state attorneys general and consumer and environmental groups filed lawsuits, compelling DOE to develop a five-year plan to catch up.
Delay not only hurts consumers — ASAP and ACEEE have estimated that the next round of updates to current national standards could save up to $43 billion annually by 2035 — it also harms manufacturers. Some complain that when DOE falls behind on deadlines, it throws their planning out of whack. Instead of a predictable, steady cadence of reviews and potential updates, manufacturers will likely face a crunch of updates compressed into a short period at some point in the future.
State action ramps up
While DOE progress has slowed, some states have stepped in to fill the void. Vermont got the ball rolling last spring, becoming the second state after California to put all federal standards into state law as a protective measure against federal rollbacks. A number of other states, including Washington, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts have joined Vermont in actively considering new standards legislation in 2018. In January, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, citing an “abdication” of federal leadership, announced a plan to develop state-level appliance standards. New York intends to work in coordination with other states to “provide certainty to manufacturers that appliance efficiency standards must be met across the United States.”
California, active at the state level for many years, has kept up its long-standing leadership role. The California Energy Commission (CEC) completed new standards for computers and monitors and advanced several others. In January, California identified another half dozen products under consideration, including several of the products left in limbo by DOE. Analysis published by ASAP and ACEEE in 2017 is helping to inform these various state efforts.
It’s not surprising that states are picking up the baton; many have been down this path before and know efficiency standards are an effective way to address a range of state policy goals. Sixteen states already have standards laws on the books. Included on the list: Texas, where then-Governor Rick Perry (now US Energy Secretary) signed standards for water-using products into law in 2009 to help address long-standing drought problems in his state. 
Light bulb standards advance
No update on appliance standards would be complete without touching on light bulbs. Congress’ 2007 law, which established the first efficiency standards for common household light bulbs, has proven both consequential and far-sighted. Initial standards took effect in 2012-14, eliminating the most inefficient versions of incandescent light bulbs. Congress required DOE to develop stronger standards, but given DOE’s past difficulty in complying with Congressional requirements, established a “backstop” standard. If DOE failed to comply with a series of procedural steps or to set an adequately strong standard, Congress provided that the standard would default to 45 lumens per watt in 2020.
That backstop requirement provided certainty to the market and set the United States on a long-term trajectory that helped spur big investments in LED technology. Those investments have produced the wide array of high-quality LED light bulbs on store shelves today that can cost less than $5 and last ten years or longer.
DOE has acknowledged that the backstop standard was triggered. But some manufacturers have argued the opposite, creating some uncertainty. In late December, a federal judge denied a request from manufacturers for a court order preventing California from implementing the light bulb standards two years early, as permitted by law. The standards are now in effect in California. If the Trump administration attempts to scale back or fails to enforce the federal standard, it’s a good bet that litigation will ensue. The law also provides authority for state attorneys general to step in to enforce the federal law.
For more information on light bulbs, check out my colleague Chris Granda’s article in this month’s AESP Strategies newsletter.
What’s next
We expect that states will be the most promising venue for progress in 2018 on new energy- and water-saving standards. The number of active states will only grow with the federal slowdown. Although DOE is missing deadlines, the agency will work on some topics. For example, DOE has begun a process to revise its procedures for developing standards. We remain hopeful that DOE will choose to advance negotiated standards, such as the agreement for new circulator pump standards completed in 2016, and initiate new negotiated rulemaking proceedings. Most likely, litigation over missed deadlines will be filed sooner or later, and, in time, DOE will get to work catching up on missed deadlines. All in all, a year after President Trump’s inauguration, work to defend national standards, ensure DOE complies with the law, and advance new, cost-effective state-level appliance standards is as active as ever.

As electric vehicles gain favor, utilities can accelerate EV adoption;"As new models with longer ranges, state-of-the-art features, and lower prices enter the market, 2018 is widely expected to be the year of the electric vehicles (EV). US auto companies now offer more than 40 plug-in vehicle models, with more to come, and consumer interest in EVs has only grown with the arrival of these new models. What’s more, large-scale EV adoption would be a win for consumers, automakers, utilities, and the environment. EVs can significantly reduce US transportation sector energy use and associated emissions, leading to large consumer and societal benefits, and the utility industry recognizes that large-scale adoption represents an opportunity for load growth at a time when many are forecasting declining sales.
Utilities can plan for — and guide — EV growth in ways that also benefit society at large, ensuring that potential environmental benefits of EVs are fully realized while taking advantage of the new business opportunities they present. Today, ACEEE released a report, Strategies for Integrating EVs into the Grid, that examines how utilities and other stakeholders are responding to this new opportunity, and how their actions relate to broader environmental goals. The report focuses on five categories of utility strategies: rate design, smart charging, charging station investment and ownership, vehicle purchase incentives, and coordination with state and local efforts. To provide insight into these strategies, the report includes case studies of three utilities that have implemented multifaceted EV integration plans: Southern California Edison, Indianapolis Power & Light, and Georgia Power Company.
Adequate charging infrastructure is an important prerequisite for EV adoption. Southern California Edison will invest customer funds in EV charging equipment that benefits both the grid and its customers, especially in underserved communities. Other utilities have also explored the possibility of partnerships to make EVs accessible to all potential users, whether through ownership, carsharing, or ridesharing. In partnership with Nissan, Georgia Power and Indianapolis Power & Light offered a $10,000 discount on a new Nissan Leaf for customers and employees in 2017.
Additionally, certain electricity rate structures can benefit both EV owners and utilities by creating an incentive to charge EVs when electricity demand is low. Georgia Power Company provides the cheapest super off-peak rate (1¢/kWh) for EV customers, allowing EV drivers to charge their vehicle for less than $0.50. Utilities can also help to maximize EVs’ pollution reduction benefits by using rate structures that promote EV charging with electricity from renewables or other low-carbon generation sources. For example, Hawaiian Electric Company provides a super off-peak rate at mid-day when it has abundant solar energy in the grid.
State and local government involvement with utilities is critical to ensuring that EVs do not create an added burden on transportation and utility systems. They can ensure that EVs support the reliable and efficient use of electricity infrastructure by requiring resource-planning activities from their respective utilities and coordination with other key stakeholders. Finally EVs’ place in the transportation system needs to align with each city’s or state’s vision for its transportation future.
California’s Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program and action plan are the gold standard for supporting EV deployment. To achieve the ambitious targets of the ZEV program and California’s greenhouse gas reduction law (AB 32), the state directed its Air Resources Board, Public Utility Commission, Energy Commission, and many other state agencies to collaborate with the Plug-In Electric Vehicle Collaborative, which included all the major utilities in California.
EVs are gaining a foothold in the transportation sector, and more utilities are approaching this new business opportunity in ways that provide optimal benefits to their customers. Further, utility coordination between states and cities can result in environmental gains from EVs. By designing policies that encourage EV adoption, utilities can facilitate a scenario in which EVs complement conventional transportation choices and create a more sustainable, equitable, and low-cost transportation system in the United States.

The proposed federal budget: Friday the 13th Part 2;"The Trump administration’s proposed budget for energy efficiency is a bad sequel to the slash-and-burn budget it proposed last year. It would cut to pieces many effective energy efficiency programs. Like last year’s budget proposed, it would eliminate help for low-income families and seniors from the Weatherization Assistance Program, and help for states and emergency preparedness from the State Energy Program. It would cut overall new funding for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by more than 70%, and would end the effective Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. Fortunately, it looks like the Congressional audience is not going to buy tickets to this movie.
If adopted, the budget would attack programs that accomplish the administration’s own goals: creating jobs, driving economic growth, and ending wasteful spending. It would end TIGER grants, which are model transportation infrastructure investments. And it would cut the Federal Energy Management Program, which helps save billions of taxpayer dollars.
One difference in the sequel is that it would not kill ENERGY STAR®; instead, it would fund the program entirely from fees. We’re glad they now see the value of helping consumers recognize efficient products and buildings. But relying on fees would still threaten the independence and the reliable funding that are essential to the great success of ENERGY STAR.
Today we are releasing a set of fact sheets that show the impact of some of the programs under attack. They estimate both what the programs are saving now, and what would be lost if the attacks succeed. The fact sheets also include a few stories about people who have benefitted from these programs.
These fact sheets describe the value of seven key programs:
The Department of Energy (DOE) appliance standards program sets minimum efficiency levels for about 60 consumer and commercial products. It already saves the average family almost $500 each year in energy and water bills.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) vehicle emissions program sets emissions requirements and fuel economy labels for cars and trucks. If allowed to take effect, the 2017–25 standards will help Americans save $370 billion through 2030.
The DOE Building Energy Codes Program helps states and local governments develop and implement energy codes for homes and commercial buildings. It saves the average family with a new home $260 in energy bills each year.
The ENERGY STAR® program labels efficient products and runs efficiency programs for homes, commercial buildings, and industry. It saves as much electricity as 30 million homes use in a year.
DOE Industrial Assessment Centers train college students to help small and medium-sized manufacturing plants save energy. They have assisted more than 18,000 plants.
The DOE State Energy Program helps state governments advance energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy security. Additional investments could save as much as $7 billion through 2040.
The DOE Weatherization Assistance Program (with added funding from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program) makes energy efficiency improvements to the homes of low-income families. The families save an average of $4,200 in lifetime utility bills.
Energy efficiency saves consumers money, makes businesses more competitive, reduces energy imports and strain on energy supplies, cuts air pollution, and helps grow the economy. Federal programs have been an important contributor to these benefits in several ways. Federally funded research and development at national labs and universities have enabled today’s light bulbs, refrigerators, and building controls. The ENERGY STAR label and other voluntary programs like Industrial Assessment Centers help consumers and businesses learn how to save energy and money. Assistance programs like the State Energy Program help others make the needed investments. Fuel economy and appliance efficiency standards protect consumers and the environment by setting minimum efficiency levels for new vehicles and products.
These programs succeed by addressing market barriers that prevent consumers and businesses from adopting beneficial energy efficiency measures. They use national labs to do pre-commercial research that the varied industries could not do on their own. They provide credible information on measures that cannot be seen. And they ensure that consumers, including renters and home buyers who often cannot choose the energy efficiency features in their homes, are not saddled with excessive energy bills. These programs also are highly cost effective. From a small federal investment, they leverage billions of dollars of market investment, which in turn yields trillions of dollars in savings on energy bills.
What does that mean for Americans? Elena Chrimat started a small business, Ideal Energy, that does home energy upgrades in Tucson, Arizona with help from Home Performance with ENERGY STAR. Debra Gann learned to teach students about the science of energy and energy conservation at an energy education camp the State of Tennessee put on with help from the State Energy Program. The Boral Bricks plant in Muskogee, Oklahoma got expert assistance in saving energy from Oklahoma State University, one of 28 Industrial Assessment Centers around the country.
We haven’t seen the final reel for 2018 yet, as Congress has still not passed appropriations bills for this year, and the 2019 sequel has barely begun. The House and the Senate both proposed milder cuts, and the new budget deal should make more money available. We still hope these vital programs will escape with some cuts and bruises or even be able to bulk up. So, we invite your help to make sure that people like Elena Chrimat and Debra Gann, and companies like Boral Bricks, do not become victims of these budget cuts.

Going for green with energy efficiency at this year's Olympics;"Later this week, athletes proudly wearing their countries’ colors will fill the winter sports arenas of PyeongChang, South Korea, as they compete in the 2018 Olympic Winter Games. But one color — green — will be present throughout the games, thanks to the PyeongChang Organizing Committee’s (POCOG) sustainability and energy efficiency efforts.
These efforts — including a high-speed railway, electric vehicles, and efficient buildings — explain why the Nigerian women’s bobsled team won’t be the only team making history at this Olympics. PyeongChang 2018 is the first Winter Olympic Games to receive the ISO 20121 certification, a sustainability standard for entire events. It is only the third Olympic Games to be certified, along with the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Summer Olympics.
New railway saves energy
The South Korean government and its citizens have long prioritized public transportation. Seoul’s subway is the third-busiest metro system in the world — touted as among the best in the world, as well. So it’s no surprise that public transit is a key part of the POCOG’s sustainability plan for the Winter Games.
With both the Games and overall accessibility in mind, the Wonju-Gangneung High-Speed Railway was constructed to connect the Incheon International Airport, located outside of Seoul, to PyeongChang and nearby Gangneung. The railway is energy efficient, using less energy and boasting a carbon footprint one-eighth that of gasoline vehicles. It is also time efficient, cutting travel time between Seoul and Gangneung to less than two hours, as compared to six hours on the Mugunghwa train. In fact, the newly constructed railway is expected to prevent more than 6,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions if 420,000 visitors choose the express railway over personal vehicles.
Locally, electric vehicles will be used to transport participants and visitors, while also cutting energy use and carbon emissions. The Korea Electric Power Corporation agreed to provide 150 electric vehicles and 24 additional charging stations to be used during the Games.
International collaboration brings comfort and efficiency
Just as the Olympic Games bring together athletes and visitors from around the world, POCOG is working with international partners, including the Dow Chemical Company, to make its sustainability efforts a success.
Using energy-efficient materials, POCOG constructed a variety of new buildings needed for the Games. Many of the buildings utilize cutting-edge materials, such as Dow’s advanced polyisocyanurate panels, which insulate facilities ranging from the Modular Houses that will accommodate event drivers, to the Olympic Plaza and the International Broadcast Centre. In all those buildings, the panels will optimize energy use and cut heating costs by keeping warm air in, and cold air and moisture out.
In some instances, however, insulation will increase energy efficiency by keeping a building cold. The Olympic Sliding Centre uses a polyurethane spray foam to ensure the luge, bobsled, and skeleton track stays frozen. The venue also has a variety of other energy-efficient features, including LED track lighting, that enabled it to be one of six G-SEED (Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design) Certified facilities built for the Games.
Going for the gold (or green)
The Olympic Committee’s measures reflect South Korea’s commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency. In ACEEE’s 2016 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard, South Korea tied with the United States for the 8th spot. The nation also ranked 6th in the transportation section, setting it apart from the United States, where transportation is currently the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions. On the other hand, South Korea ranked 13th in the buildings section, so it is good to see POCOG going the extra mile on building efficiency.
We at ACEEE welcome the efficiency efforts of the Games and the country as a whole. We will be updating our rankings of South Korea and other countries with the June release of our 2018 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard. The scorecard will be grist for our upcoming International Symposium. Stay tuned for details and have fun watching the Olympics.

Energy efficiency can clean the air we breathe (third part of video series);"In a new three-part video series, ACEEE explores how energy efficiency can improve people’s health. We hear the stories of homeowners in three states. Our first part explored efficiency’s impact in rural West Virginia, and our second part looked at the impact in the city of  Baltimore, MD. Part Three takes us to Pittsburgh, PA.
Pollution from dirty power plants and steel mills is part of Pittsburgh’s history. Will Allen, founder of the Will Allen Foundation and former Pittsburgh Steelers player, remembers what the city was like in the 1970s. “You couldn’t walk down the streets during the day because of the soot and the waste from the coal plants and the steel mills,” he said, adding, “When you wore a white shirt, you had to change your shirt,” earning Pittsburgh the nickname “two-shirt city.”
Despite progress, city residents still experience poor air quality.  
  “Many Pittsburghers felt we had kind of conquered air quality because we rid ourselves of our smoky past,” said Laura Nettleton, sustainable design architect at Thoughtful Balance. Yet, she said, the city has some of the worst air quality in the country today. “So while it’s not dark and smoky the way it used to be, it still has an impact on our health.” In a recent American Lung Association study, Pittsburgh ranked among the dirtiest US cities for pollution that triggers serious problems with the lungs and heart.
Energy efficiency is helping to improve Pittsburghers’ lives, both inside and outside the home.
Reducing energy waste lessens the need to burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. Those cuts deliver big gains in health, because pollutants from burning fossil fuels contribute to four of the leading causes of death in the United States: cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, heart disease, and stroke.
Energy efficiency also improves air quality indoors, making people healthier and more comfortable inside their homes. Efficiency improvements can remove health risks such as carbon monoxide from backdrafting appliances and eliminate exposure to extreme temperatures. Cathy Guilli and her family experienced these benefits firsthand after participating in a local weatherization program. She suffers from fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder intensified by cold temperatures and temperature swings. After the program replaced the family’s 37-year-old furnace, Cathy noticed a change: “Having the new furnace on and having heat everywhere was just so much different this year. And I just felt so much better.” After installing a dehumidifier in her daughter’s room, Cathy said, “it seemed that she wasn’t sick continuously like she was before.” The weatherization program kept the home warm in the winter, eliminated its cold drafts, and improved its indoor air quality.
By continuing to advance energy efficiency, Will Allen said, Pittsburgh can improve the lives and health of residents. “A city like Pittsburgh has all the pieces to be a great example at the national level.”
ACEEE’s video series is part of its new Health and Environment program, launched last year to explore the linkages among health, environment, and energy efficiency by conducting original research and educating policymakers. To showcase this research and promote the work of prominent experts in this growing field, ACEEE will host the first-ever Conference on Health, Environment & Energy in New Orleans in December 2018. And stay tuned for a series of forthcoming ACEEE reports that will further explore the health and environmental benefits of saving energy. In March, our Mission Attainment: Incorporating Pollution Reductions from Energy Efficiency in State Implementation Plans report will highlight areas across Pennsylvania and other states where reducing energy waste can help reduce harmful pollutants and meet federal air quality regulations, helping Pittsburghers and residents across the state to breathe easier.

Affordable Tech Marvels Dominate Greenest Vehicles List;"Washington, DC—For those who like clean vehicles with state-of-the-art technology or simply want to reduce their environmental footprint, today’s market has good news. A slew of affordable, efficient, tech-smart cars and trucks are now on the market, giving American consumers plenty of options for buying a greener vehicle. Today at greenercars.org, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released its 21st annual GreenerCars vehicle ratings to help consumers make that choice.
For the second year, the mid-sized Hyundai Ioniq Electric takes the top spot on the Greenest List, achieving the highest-ever Green Score of 70. The Ioniq brings high efficiency in a practical size, earning its place at the top of our Greenest List. The Mercedes-Benz Smart Fortwo Electric Drive, BMW i3 BEV, Kia Soul Electric, Ford Focus Electric, and Honda Clarity also earn places among the greenest vehicles for sale today.
Perhaps the most buzzworthy automotive news of the last year was the introduction of the all-new Tesla Model 3, which joins the Chevrolet Bolt (ranked sixth) as the second electric vehicle (EV) that consumers can purchase for less than $40,000 (before tax credits) and drive more than 200 miles on a full charge. The Model 3 Long Range claims the fourth spot with a score of 67. 
The following vehicles make up the Greenest List for 2018, representing the most environmentally friendly cars for sale today. Each car is given a Green Score based on an environmental damage index (EDX), which reflects the cost to human health from air pollution associated with vehicle manufacturing, the production and distribution of fuel, and vehicle tailpipes.       
The automotive industry is producing a variety of cars and trucks with highly efficient electrified drivetrains. Electrified drivetrains incorporate an electric motor and battery, driving entirely on electricity in the case of a pure EV, or in conjunction with a traditional gasoline or diesel engine in the case of hybrids and plug-in hybrids.
”Automakers have brought an impressive number of highly efficient vehicles to market, giving American consumers more choices, whether they are looking for a compact car or a fully-loaded pickup,” said Eric Junga, Transportation Research Analyst at ACEEE. “And as electric vehicles become more affordable and more enticing thanks to increased range and state-of-the-art features, sales are really picking up steam.”
Hybrids also make an appearance on the Greenest list, with Toyota’s Prius lineup and Hyundai’s Ioniq hybrid variants performing well. The Kia Niro plug-in hybrid, using the same drivetrain as the Ioniq, and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in with an impressive 53-mile electric-only range, both return to the Greenest List, as well.
For the third consecutive year, the Greenest List is populated completely by vehicles with some form of electric powertrain and contains no vehicle with an internal combustion engine (ICE) alone. Manufacturers have made impressive strides in the efficiency of ICEs, but adding a small degree of electrification can further reduce environmental impact over the life of a vehicle. Even when considering the emissions from the production of batteries, electrified cars and trucks take claim as the most environmentally friendly vehicles available today.
Greenercars.org also identifies practical options in each class among the top widely available automatic transmission gasoline or diesel models, because vehicles on the Greenest list may not meet the needs of every individual or may not be widely available. The Greener Choices List includes both conventional vehicles and traditional hybrids, but excludes plug-in hybrids and pure battery electric vehicles that require the availability of a charger to maximize efficiency.
  The Greener Choices list demonstrates that consumers can make greener choices, even if their vehicle needs aren’t met by those on the Greenest List. The new Toyota Camry Hybrid, which just misses the Greenest List, shows up on the Greener Choices list as a high-scoring option for buyers looking for a midsize car. Greener Choices also highlights green options for trucks and SUVs for those buyers who need the extra space, including the rear-wheel-drive 2.7-liter Ford-150 and Honda CR-V. The Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon Diesel earned a score of 42, and the Chrysler Pacifica minivan returns with a score of 41. While plug-ins are excluded from Greener Choices, it’s worth noting that the Pacifica plug-in hybrid option scored an impressive 55 and is cost-competitive with the gasoline-only version when federal incentives are factored in.
Greenercars.org also provides a Meanest List, populated this year — as usual — by large SUVs, well-equipped pickup trucks, heavier medium-duty vehicles, and European luxury cars that are the least friendly to the environment.
Green Scores of the 1,500+ configurations of all model year 2018 vehicles are available for free in the greenercars.org interactive database, along with each configuration’s fuel economy, health-related pollution impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions. Visitors to the database can build custom lists for comparing vehicles. Greenercars.org also features a write-up on model year 2018 market trends, a consumer primer on vehicles and the environment, and advice on how to buy green when shopping for a new car or truck.
Updates to this year’s methodology include new estimates of emissions associated with electricity production, as well as updated emissions from the manufacturing and recycling of vehicles.

This year's Super Bowl stadium can withstand snow and save energy;"All those watching the Super Bowl this weekend, take heart: there’s a good chance the Minneapolis stadium roof won’t collapse — as its predecessor the Metrodome’s did in December 2010.
That’s because U.S. Bank Stadium, which opened in 2016, features a sleek, practical roof made of a material that lets the snow fall into a gigantic snow gutter. This transparent material, Ethylene Tetrafluoroethyl (ETFE), also saves energy. It allows natural sunlight into the stadium, giving the venue a natural, outdoorsy feel, while also allowing solar thermal heating that redistributes warm air in the winter and pumps cold air in the summer.

The unique high-tech roof is only one of the stadium’s many green features. U.S. Bank Stadium was the first NFL stadium to be built with LED sports lighting, which consumes 75% less electricity than the metal halide lighting typically used in the dark ages (pun intended). The facility was also constructed with a plethora of other energy-efficient features, including high-efficiency motors and advanced air-handling units, all of which combine to cut U.S. Bank Stadium’s energy use to 92 thousand British thermal units per square foot (kBtu/sf), compared to the Metrodome’s 104 kBTU/sf, and enabled the stadium to be certified LEED Gold last November by the U.S. Green Building Council.
This is all part of a larger effort by college and professional sports teams across the country to save energy. In fact, U.S. Bank Stadium is just one of 80 LEED-certified sports venues in the United States. Seattle’s CenturyLink Field, for example, reduced its annual utility costs by 21% thanks to a variety of energy efficiency measures. Nationals Park, located in Washington, DC, was the first MLB stadium to earn LEED certification and was projected to use 15% less energy than a comparable ballpark.
The largest energy savings are often achieved through a team effort, and the construction of Minneapolis’ U.S. Bank Stadium was no different. Ranked ninth in ACEEE’s 2016 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, Minnesota has a number of policies in place to encourage energy savings. The state’s Sustainable Building 2030 standards call for energy consumption reductions of 60% for any building built after 2010, with the ultimate goal of reaching net zero in 2030. All state buildings are required to meet the State of Minnesota Sustainable Building Guidelines — also known as the B3 Guidelines — and U.S. Bank Stadium uses the B3 Benchmarking tool to track its actual energy use.
Beyond the stadium, the state requires electric and gas utilities to invest a portion of their revenues in energy efficiency through the Conservation Improvement Program (CIP). These and many other energy-saving measures and initiatives enabled Minnesota to achieve the 10th highest electricity savings in the United States in 2016.
The City of Minneapolis, which ranked eleventh in ACEEE’s City Energy Efficiency Scorecard, also understands the value of teamwork. Building on a century-long partnership, Minneapolis, Xcel Energy, and CenterPoint Energy recently agreed to a first-in-the-nation leadership framework called the Minneapolis Clean Energy Partnership that aims to help the city reach its Climate Action Plan and Energy Vision for 2040 goals.
Whether the Patriots or the Eagles win this Sunday, one thing is certain: everyone wins with energy efficiency. With strong policies, evolving technologies, and a lot of teamwork, we can all save money and energy in our offices, at home, and in sports arenas across the country.

Utilities can do more to reap energy-water nexus benefits;"Many utilities are missing out on additional energy and water savings—and related benefits—despite beginning to place more value on the link between water and energy, according to our new report, Saving Watts to Save Drops: Inclusion of Water Efficiency in Energy Efficiency Programs. The report examines energy utilities’ efforts to capture and value the water savings achieved through their energy efficiency programs. It builds on earlier ACEEE research regarding best practices for jointly managed energy and water programs and energy intensity of water and wastewater services.
Although the policy world often considers energy and water to be two independent and distinct areas of resource management, they are inextricably linked. It takes water to provide energy for cooling and heating our homes, and it takes energy to transport and treat the water we drink. This relationship means that energy efficiency and water conservation go hand in hand, with energy savings translating to water savings and vice-versa. Typically referred to as the energy-water nexus, this dynamic is the subject of our new report.
Making progress, with room for more
While still relatively limited in practice, utilities in at least a dozen states are accounting for avoided costs or indirect energy savings from reduced water consumption achieved through their energy efficiency programs. However we find that many energy utilities are estimating these water savings conservatively.  
Stakeholders in places like California, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, meanwhile, are digging deeper to incorporate the full energy intensity of water into their valuation of energy efficiency portfolios. These efforts are typically spurred by a mix of utility commission-level leadership, availability of data, and competition for water resources. But many energy utilities do not track or value avoided costs from water savings, missing out on the opportunity to account for and promote the full benefits of their energy efficiency programs.
Utility efforts to pursue savings at the energy-water nexus come in a variety of forms, depending on local conditions and customers served. These include calculating savings from measures directly installed by utilities in homes and businesses, forming innovative partnerships to address hard-to-reach customers, and more advanced efforts to utilize smart technologies that promote water-saving behavior changes by accessing real-time consumption data. A number of utilities, particularly in California, even operate joint energy-water programs that leverage the respective strengths of the energy and water utilities. By combining programs and defining roles and responsibilities through a memorandum of agreement, these utilities reduce their administrative costs.  
How utilities can seize additional savings
States and utilities are increasingly making an effort to fully assess and value the energy embedded in water use, and many utilities are indeed making progress in integrating the value of water into their programs in ways that work for them. However significant challenges — such as data limitations; variations in water quality, abundance, and infrastructure; and the need to build consensus among the many players involved in making decisions about data collection and policy approaches — still remain. If states, utilities, and other stakeholders can work together to overcome these challenges, they can more effectively track and maximize the benefits of water savings in their energy efficiency portfolios.

ACEEE Supports Smart Manufacturing by Partnering with Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute;"Washington, DC—ACEEE today announces that it has joined the Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII). ACEEE now joins the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC), the U.S. Department of Energy, and numerous academic, industry, and nonprofit partners in their effort to enable the development and deployment of smart manufacturing technologies that can increase energy productivity, economic performance, and workforce expansion in American manufacturing.
“Smart manufacturing makes it possible for companies to reduce their energy use and save money on their energy bills by optimizing their manufacturing processes. In fact, increased investments in Smart Manufacturing could save American manufacturers $15 billion in annual electricity cost savings by 2035,” said Ethan Rogers, ACEEE’s industry program director. “ACEEE is proud to partner with the Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute to make those energy and cost savings a reality.”
“Through innovative research and development projects CESMII is poised to create new ways for factories and facilities to increase their productivity and lower their energy costs,” added CESMII CEO Jim Wetzel. “And we will reach our ambitious technology and workforce goals with expert partners like ACEEE.” The institute was created to spur advances and to accelerate the enabling business, technology, workforce, and infrastructure practices that lead to the integration of advanced sensors, controls, platforms and modeling to transform the energy efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness of advanced manufacturing in the United States.
Previous ACEEE research found that companies could see a 20% reduction in energy intensity, on average, from smart manufacturing investments. As a consortium member, ACEEE will provide technical advice to help bring those energy intensity reductions to fruition, while also supporting the consortium’s workforce development efforts.
CESMII’s goals include a 50% reduction in cost and time to deploy Smart Manufacturing (SM)—the business, technology, infrastructure, and workforce practice of optimizing manufacturing through the use of engineered systems that integrate operational technologies and information technologies (OT/IT)—in existing processes within 5 years. CESMII’s focus is the development and integration of advanced sensors, controls, platforms and high performance computational models to help companies of all sizes across a variety of manufacturing industries and technology providers realize the benefits of SM and make U.S. manufacturers more competitive. 
About CESMII
The Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII), in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office, brings over $140 million in public-private investment to enable Smart Manufacturing technologies and systems to become the driving, sustainable engine that delivers real-time business and energy improvements in U.S. manufacturing. CESMII’s mission is to radically accelerate the development and adoption of advanced sensors, controls, platforms, and models for U.S. manufacturing through integrated industry-led Smart Manufacturing (SM) technical, business and educational methodologies. http://www.cesmii.org/

Vehicle standards spur fuel economy gains. A rollback would throw us into reverse.;"With the threat of a rollback looming, two new reports from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) show that federal fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles are working. Furthermore, new models, such as those on display at the Detroit Auto Show this week, show that additional gains are within reach.
Celebrating and lamenting fuel economy trends
EPA released the new Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends report last week, showing that average fuel economy of new vehicles increased 0.1 miles per gallon from model year 2015 to model year 2016. Should we celebrate that fuel economy is increasing, even as consumers buy bigger vehicles? Or should we lament the slow pace of progress, despite advances in vehicle technology appearing in the news almost daily?
Both, of course. That fuel economy continues to rise is unquestionably the result of tightening fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards. As the Manufacturer Performance Report showed, automakers stayed in compliance with greenhouse gas emissions standards, despite the paltry increase in average miles per gallon, by spending some of the credits they’d accumulated through over-compliance in prior years. And they have plenty left in the bank: the industry spent only 11% of available credits to comply with the model year 2016 greenhouse gas standards.   
Why such slow progress on average fuel economy?
Many people are buying crossovers, which consume more fuel than cars do. Had consumers maintained 2015 buying patterns in 2016, fuel economy would have increased 0.3 miles per gallon. But this is still less than one-third the efficiency gain anticipated for model year 2016 when the standards were adopted.
As it turns out, cars and pickup trucks separately increased their average fuel economy by only 0.1 mpg in 2016. In the case of pickups, one might expect manufacturers to emphasize that 2016 was not a year of major redesign for the big pickup brands. They might point to exciting upgrades to the Ram and Silverado/Sierra pickups coming in 2019. Or to the 37-mpg F-150 with an Achates opposed-piston engine on display at the Detroit Auto Show, expected to hit the market around 2020, beating the model year 2025 standard by 12% at an incremental cost far below EPA’s projected compliance costs.
Instead, manufacturers are citing their meager fuel economy gains in 2016 and 2017 as evidence that the standards need to be rolled back. They’ve got the administration’s ear: an earlier determination that rising standards through model year 2025 remain appropriate has been reopened, and a new proposal is expected on March 30th.
Data are key to continued progress
In the meantime, it’s a relief to see EPA’s venerable Trends Report appear this year, only months after the Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Lab that produces these reports—and generates the data underlying them—faced a near-death experience in the FY 2018 budget process. The reports, which are models of adept data analysis and transparency, are the authoritative source of information on these timely issues.
Fuel economy matters. An extra mile per gallon would have saved drivers $13 billion at the pump last year, even at the relatively low average gasoline price of $2.40 per gallon—and those prices won’t last. If the administration decides to roll back these valuable vehicle standards, consumers, the environment, and the US economy will pay the price.

Energy efficiency can help address childhood asthma (second part of video series);"In a new three-part video series, ACEEE explores how energy efficiency can improve people’s health. We hear the stories of homeowners in three states. Our first part explored efficiency’s impact in rural areas. To look at its effect in urban areas, Part Two takes us to Baltimore, MD.
In the large mid-Atlantic city of Baltimore, where summers are hot and winters cold, Keyona Ball had a problem with her house. Some rooms were really hot and others stayed cold. Her seven-year old son suffers from asthma, and weather extremes—whether hot and humid or cold and dry—can trigger his attacks. After her home was weatherized, she found that better insulation and air sealing improved the situation. “The heat is more consistent throughout the house,” she said. “I did notice this past winter that he didn’t have to have as many breathing treatments.”
  Nikia Pickett, another Baltimore mom whose young son has asthma, tells a similar story. She learned from a weatherization program that poor air sealing was allowing allergens and other outdoor air contaminants into her home. With proper sealing, she said, “We went from him having an asthma attack once every four to six weeks to twice this year.”
These women are dealing with a serious and increasingly common illness. More than six million US children have asthma. Children are particularly vulnerable, because they have smaller airways than adults. Asthma attacks can be fatal so proactively addressing the illness is crucial.
Energy efficiency improvements can help. Installing insulation and sealing gaps or holes can reduce a home’s indoor humidity, cold drafts, air pollutants, and allergens such as mold—all asthma triggers.
These triggers can result in a trip to the emergency room or even a hospital admission. Asthma can’t be cured, but it can be controlled. While there is no substitute for the care of a physician and prescription medications, preventive actions such as installing weather stripping or replacing leaky windows can reduce the incidence of asthma attacks.
The Green and Healthy Homes Initiative (GHHI) in Baltimore is one of several programs in the United States doing this kind of work. In March, ACEEE will detail similar programs nationwide in a report, The Next Nexus: Exemplary Programs That Save Energy and Improve Health. Additionally, ACEEE will host the Conference on Health, Environment & Energy (CHEE) in New Orleans in December to explore how energy choices can affect our health and the environment.

New York Governor Cuomo Announces New Energy Efficiency Targets and Appliance Standards;"Steven Nadel, Executive Director
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in connection with his State of the State address today, announced a plan to create new energy efficiency targets and appliance standards. He directed the state’s Department of Public Service and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to propose new 2025 energy efficiency targets by Earth Day, April 22, 2018, and also announced the state’s plans to develop new appliance efficiency standards for products not covered by federal standards, coordinating efforts with other states. According to the Governor, the targets will be “achieved through cost effective implementation strategies and innovative approaches from both utilities and the [New York State] Clean Energy Fund.” With this announcement, the discussion should move from whether to set new targets (a subject hotly debated in the state for several years) to what the specific targets will be and how to hold utilities and other implementers accountable for meeting the targets.
Prior ACEEE research has found that energy-savings targets are perhaps the most important state policy for achieving large energy savings. However, in recent years, following the expiration of a 15% savings by 2015 target, New York State has fallen behind many other northeastern states on the level of energy efficiency investments and savings. As a result, and as other states in the region set aggressive targets, New York slipped from third place in the 2013 ACEEE State Energy Efficiency Scorecard to a tie for seventh in the 2017 Scorecard.
With these announcements it appears that New York may be reinvigorating its energy efficiency efforts. Governor Cuomo noted that the new target-setting and standard-setting processes will engage both public and private stakeholders. ACEEE stands ready to support the development of strong, implementable, and enforceable targets and standards.

2018 will be a year of seizing opportunities and facing challenges;"The past year has been eventful for energy efficiency, bringing progress in some areas and backsliding in others. We have made significant progress and are poised for more, particularly at the state and city levels. Meanwhile, we face substantial challenges at the federal level, and will continue to emphasize defense in 2018, while also working to develop new strategies for progress.
Given 2017, we have reasons to be optimistic about continued progress in energy efficiency:
Energy-saving technologies and practices advance. LED bulbs accounted for about 30% of screw-in “A-line” lamp sales in the first half of 2017 and smart thermostat sales increased about 19% per year according to one estimate.
Investments in energy efficiency continue to grow. The International Energy Agency estimates US efficiency investments of $41 billion in 2016, and total global investments of $231 billion, a 9% increase over the prior year (2017 figures are not yet available).
States move forward. They enacted new energy efficiency legislation in Colorado, Maryland and Nevada, and took steps to implement 2016 legislation in Illinois and Michigan. In Ohio, a moratorium on savings targets expired and utilities are proposing new programs.
Local governments became more active, including more than 300 that have pledged to meet the Paris climate change goals as part of the We Are Still In campaign. Several cities are establishing new building retrofit policies. For example, Mayor de Blasio of New York City announced plans to require major efficiency upgrades for 14,500 large, inefficient buildings. Likewise, 30 cities jointly informed vehicle manufacturers of their interest in purchasing 114,000 electric vehicles for their fleets.  
Total savings from utility energy efficiency programs increase, with savings of more than 220 billion kWh in 2016 (the last year with data available), which is about 6% of 2016 electricity consumption (see figure below).
Source: ACEEE 2017 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, p. 26.
The new federal tax legislation increased the incentive to upgrade when existing equipment and roofs need repair. The bill, enacted in December, allows some new HVAC equipment and roofs to be immediately expensed, instead of depreciated over 39 years.
However, there are also potential roadblocks and challenges to keep in mind:
Efficiency gains from appliance standards are at risk. After affirming several new consensus appliance standards negotiated during the Obama administration (e.g., for pool pumps and for residential central air conditioners and heat pumps), further work on establishing new standards has ground to a halt. The last time this happened (during President George W. Bush’s first term), states and environmental groups successfully sued; the settlement set a schedule for the Department of Energy (DOE) to issue standards after President Barack Obama took office. In December, the administration put more than 20 statutorily-required appliance efficiency standard updates on hold indefinitely, in addition to opening a proceeding that could make it more difficult to update product efficiency standards. Other appliance standards developments will be discussed in a forthcoming blog post by Andrew deLaski.
Key federal efficiency programs are on the chopping block. Over the past year, the administration has proposed eliminating ENERGY STARÔ, rolling back vehicle fuel economy standards and the Clean Power Plan, in addition to proposing deep cuts to federal energy efficiency budgets. As of this writing none of these proposals have been adopted, but we expect some to advance in 2018.
Federal implementation efforts are also being scaled back, as a result of the current administration’s preference for “pre-commercial” research and development over implementation efforts.
The administration is working to weaken fuel economy and emissions standards for passenger vehicles and medium and heavy trucks. We have discussed these developments in prior blog posts (see here and here). We expect the administration to make additional regulatory proposals, but final rules and court challenges will extend into 2019 if not beyond.
Efficiency programs were challenged in several states, including a raid on energy efficiency funds in Connecticut to help balance the state budget.
The Path Forward
Looking into the new year, we will have both opportunities and challenges.
We see local and state policy as a substantial opportunity. The “We Are Still In” communities now need to identify, adopt, and implement policies to achieve these goals. Several states will be establishing new energy savings targets, undertaking integrated planning processes, and expanding programs in response to recent legislation. We are also hoping for additional efficiency progress in New Jersey and Virginia, where governors supportive of energy efficiency were recently elected. For example, both states are considering joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
With the pause on new federal efficiency standards, several states are considering new state efficiency standards. Likewise, California is expected to pursue light- and heavy-duty greenhouse gas emissions standards in 2018, and other states may choose to adopt the California standards.
We are primarily focused on preventing backsliding at the national level, while also developing a positive agenda. ACEEE and other organizations are pushing back against proposed budget cuts to efficiency programs at DOE and other federal agencies as well as Environmental Protection Agency programs such as ENERGY STAR, WaterSense and SmartWay. We expect to see modest budget cuts rather than the draconian cuts proposed by the administration. Final funding decisions are due by January 19.
We will support positive reforms, while opposing efforts to eliminate or weaken efficiency standards and programs. Congress is considering changes to efficiency laws that would weaken fuel economy and appliance standards, ENERGY STAR, and building energy codes. We are discussing more modest reforms to ENERGY STAR and appliance standards with those seeking changes, but we will oppose major changes that would reduce the impact of these programs.
New legislation generally needs 60 votes in the Senate, requiring some bipartisan support. Furthermore, the possibility that any legislation will be enacted shrinks as we move into the 2018 campaign. Still, smaller efficiency measures are in play in the Senate energy bill and other measures could be included in post-disaster federal rebuilding efforts or an infrastructure package (Senate Majority Leader McConnell has indicated that infrastructure could be on the Congressional agenda).
Our Resolutions for 2018
All in all, efficiency is making progress at the local and state levels, but strong headwinds remain at the national level. Minimizing slippage at the national level while expanding state and local policies and programs will be critical. Through our research and outreach, ACEEE will continue to tout the benefits of energy efficiency for a strong US economy, and will work to ensure that American families and businesses continue to see the greatest energy efficiency benefits possible.

What the tax bill may mean for energy efficiency;"Although the tax bill passed by Congress today will bring the largest changes to taxes (and government revenue) seen in decades, we don’t expect the bill to have such a dramatic impact on energy efficiency.
The greatest impacts, both positive and negative, will likely come from the broad changes to tax and revenue. Some companies and families will have more money to spend on efficiency improvements (or on energy-using activities) as a result of the tax cuts; others will have less. The deduction for state and local taxes will be capped, which could make it more difficult for state and local governments to invest taxpayer dollars in efficiency upgrades and programs. Federal deficits will go up, which could increase pressures to cut agency spending, including on efficiency programs.
In addition, two specific provisions will have a relatively direct impact on energy efficiency investments, also both good and bad:
The bill eliminates one type of support for state and local energy efficiency and clean energy projects by ending authority for new tax credit bonds, including Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs), effective January 1. QECBs are state and local bonds subsidized by the federal government that finance energy efficiency improvements to public buildings, green community programs, mass commuting, and certain renewables projects. As of May, $1.3 billion in QECBs had been issued, but $1.9 billion in additional authority remained.
It also expands business expensing by raising the cap on deductible business investments to $1 million, and makes HVAC equipment and roofs installed in commercial buildings eligible. Although businesses depreciate, or capitalize, most investments over a number of years, they can expense investments including computers and equipment—and now HVAC systems and roofs—up to the cap, deducting the full cost from taxable income in the first year. Unlike in the earlier House-passed bill, there is no efficiency requirement, but the new equipment and roofs will generally be more efficient.
At least as important to energy efficiency is what the bill will not do. A number of other provisions, once again both good and bad, were in the earlier House-passed bill but were dropped in the final negotiations:
The bill does not extend the orphaned tax credits for combined heat and power, fuel cells, ground source heat pumps, and other technologies that were left behind when the tax credits for wind and solar power were extended. The proposed extension has now been pushed to discussion of a broader tax “extenders” bill.
It does not end the tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles, a credit that supports continuing innovation and market growth.
It does not end private activity bonds, tax-exempt bonds that are used to finance low-income housing and some energy efficiency improvements, among other purposes.                                    
The new year is just days away, and will likely bring additional tax efforts, including the potential extenders bill. That bill could propose extending expired tax incentives for efficient home improvements, new homes, and new and improved commercial buildings, in addition to the orphaned tax credits mentioned above.
We will continue to work to advance energy efficiency through tax policy.

Smart buildings save energy and improve occupant comfort;"Smart technologies can reduce a building’s energy use by nearly a fifth and yield additional benefits, such as increased worker productivity, according to our new report, Smart Buildings: a Deeper Dive into Market Segments. This report documents how many types of buildings — not just the biggest and ritziest — can benefit from the latest interconnected technologies, from simple occupancy sensors to complex energy management and information systems. It builds on our report from early 2017, Smart Buildings: Using Smart Technology to Save Energy in Existing Buildings.
So far, large showcase buildings with robust budgets have been the first to embrace smart technologies. Yet to achieve substantial energy savings in the commercial building sector others will need to adopt them as well. We calculate that smart technologies will save an estimated 8-18% of total energy consumption in subsectors that include Class B offices, small chain and independent retail stores, middle-tier franchise hotels, and regional nonteaching hospitals. Of course, actual savings will depend on a variety of factors; we provide estimates of average expected savings based on publicly available information and EIA’s Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey data. 
The four subsectors we studied — office, retail, hotels, and hospitals — already demonstrate notable differences in their use of smart technologies. For example, almost three-quarters of the health care sector use a building automation system, while less than 40% of hotels contain them. We find that some subsectors may save more energy than others, but given the wide variety of emerging technologies, all can benefit. Below is a snapshot of each subsector, including its average estimated energy savings from adopting smart technologies.
How do buildings benefit from being “smart”?
Offices (18% average savings) come in all shapes and sizes, and technology is dramatically changing how employees use these buildings. Improved audio and video technology means that office workers telecommute more often. Smart technologies like occupancy sensors, smart thermostats, and HVAC and lighting controls can help reduce energy usage in unoccupied offices, conference rooms, and other spaces. Smart systems have been shown to improve worker productivity and even increase property value.
Retail stores (14% average savings) are undergoing their own transformations to stay competitive with online retailers, often focusing on improved customer experience and engagement. Smart energy management systems, thermostats, and lights can help reduce energy consumption and create a more comfortable and attractive environment for customers. Certain types of occupancy sensors, like indoor positioning systems, can also provide a retailer with valuable data on customer behavior in the store.
Hotels (8% average savings) have embraced technologies like guest management systems and mobile check-in. These technologies can work hand in hand with energy-saving smart technologies that control guest room HVAC systems and window shading. Smart controls can also help reduce energy from lighting and HVAC in conference areas and pumps in pool and spa areas. Smart hotels use apps and other technologies to provide guests with a more customized experience, which in turn can improve the hotel’s revenue.
Hospitals (14% average savings) increasingly use technology to ensure patient safety, from electronic health care management systems to wearable health monitors. Because hospitals typically operate 24/7 and rely on significant mechanical equipment to maintain patient health and comfort, they are also the most energy-intensive type of commercial building. Smart technologies can help address the long operating hours and high equipment loads. For instance, smart lighting systems can reduce energy use and increase patient comfort by better matching light output to occupancy and user needs. Without wasting energy, smart sensors and ventilation controls can maintain the ventilation needed to prevent the spread of diseases.
What does the future hold?
Industry, government, and program administrators will need to collaborate to overcome barriers to smart buildings, such as interoperability, cybersecurity, and workforce training. To increase uptake in the market, we recommend that efficiency program administrators leverage the data that smart devices are already collecting. (Some in the industry say that the most valuable resource may no longer be oil, but data.) Smart buildings of the future will seamlessly integrate into our everyday lives, saving energy and optimizing occupant experience and comfort. As more buildings become smart, they will connect to smart grids, smart vehicles, and other components. Our report describes how incorporating smart technologies into commercial buildings now can help create smart cities of the future.

Statement of ACEEE and ASAP on Federal Plans to Put Updates to Appliance Standards on Ice;"The US Department of Energy has indefinitely deferred action on 20 appliance energy efficiency standards, based on yesterday’s Fall 2017 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. By deciding not to honor statutory deadlines for these standards, DOE is jeopardizing billions of dollars in savings for American families and businesses, while also creating uncertainty for manufacturers and markets.              
The efficiency standards completed through 2016 are already saving the average American household about $500 on its energy bills each year, and by 2035, the required updates could save consumers and businesses another $43 billion annually.
Periodically updating these standards, as required by law, guarantees that all consumers gain the benefits of technological progress that deliver dramatic energy savings. In order to ensure additional energy savings for families and businesses, as well as continued reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, DOE must fulfill its legal obligations to update energy efficiency standards.
  The Appliance Standards Awareness Project organizes and leads a broad-based coalition effort that works to advance, win, and defend new appliance, equipment, and lighting standards which deliver large energy and water savings, monetary savings, and environmental benefits.
  The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.

Mayors tout the importance of energy efficiency in meeting climate goals;"At the North American Climate Summit this month in Chicago, city officials from several countries recognized energy efficiency as an important emissions reduction strategy. Many described how they are making it part of their climate action plans.
The summit brought together mayors and other officials from 50-plus municipalities, including large cities like Austin and Phoenix and smaller communities like Pittsboro, North Carolina. Officials from the United States, Canada, Mexico, and other countries gathered to sign the Chicago Climate Charter and discuss strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Signatories of the Charter committed to several provisions, including decreasing their communities’ emissions by the same percentage as the reduction that their nations agreed to in the Paris Agreement.
Mayors discussed their cities’ methods for reducing emissions, such as increased recycling from the waste sector and greater reliance on renewable energy. They prominently cited energy efficiency. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel pointed to the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge as a driving force behind Chicago’s 7% emissions reduction between 2010 and 2015. When accepting a C40 award for Retrofit Chicago, he said energy efficiency should be treated as an energy source, alongside other resource options.
Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett touted the Milwaukee Energy Efficiency program (Me2). “For a lot of regular people, when you talk about climate change, their response is, ‘What about the climate in my neighborhood?’ So we talk about how our energy efficiency programs help people save on their on energy bills, finance new systems like insulation and furnaces, and create local jobs,” said Mayor Barrett at the Summit. “Our Me2 home energy efficiency program and our comprehensive Better Buildings Challenge program for commercial buildings really demonstrate how energy efficiency can improve the value of buildings and help building owners be more profitable, while also reducing greenhouse gases and pollution at the community level.”
Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto described how his city’s District Energy Initiative plans to change energy generation. As part of the initiative, the city agreed to work with the US Department of Energy to expand the city’s district energy systems and microgrids. (Mayor Peduto discusses this in further detail at the 1-hour mark here.) 
What did other mayors think about reducing energy waste? Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski touted the city’s recent building energy benchmarking ordinance at a session hosted by the City Energy Project. Austin Mayor Steve Adler and Knoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero touched on low-income weatherization and the importance of making energy efficiency opportunities available to all. Former San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, who died this week, pointed to the importance of a sustainable transportation system that includes options for transit, biking, and walking.  
City leaders at the Summit understood the prominent role energy efficiency can have in mitigating climate change impacts. Efficiency is a win-win for communities, helping households and businesses save on energy bills while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The next step for cities is taking action and holding themselves accountable. Initiatives including Retrofit Chicago and the Milwaukee Energy Efficiency Program indicate cities are moving forward. While our City Scorecard shows that cities have increased their energy efficiency efforts over the last two years, it also shows that cities can do a lot more to save energy. Based on the strong local leadership I saw at the Climate Summit, cities seem poised to take on the challenge.

"We can harness markets to scale energy efficiency; Our report shows how";"During the holiday season, we are inundated with marketing messages as well as goods and services — hallmarks of our market economy. Popular products include holiday lights, once made only with incandescent bulbs but now mostly with LEDs. This shift to efficient LEDs is an offshoot of a much larger market transformation in lighting, which has saved vast amounts of energy.
Our new report examines such successes and looks at ways to harness market forces for increased energy efficiency across a broad spectrum of products and services. It also identifies several promising markets in the early stages of transformation, such as smart thermostats, zero energy buildings, and strategic energy management.
What is market transformation?
Market transformation is rooted in the early experience with utility customer energy efficiency programs and appliance efficiency standards. In the late 1970s, California established the first standards for making appliances more efficient. Early utility programs demonstrated customer interest and savings potential by reducing energy waste in homes, businesses, and industry. Building on these initial successes, many thought leaders saw a much greater potential for energy efficiency. They observed that many products, such as clothes washers, lightbulbs, and windows, wasted energy. They proposed strategically intervening in selected markets to transform them to make energy-efficient products the norm.
This idea came to be called “market transformation” and became a model for many energy efficiency programs delivered by utilities and other state and regional entities beginning in the early 1990s. It showed how efficiency can be expanded and some of its gains locked in by setting standards and codes.
ACEEE has been actively engaged in market transformation since its inception. We conducted early research and helped develop some of the foundational concepts and practices. Many of our allies have been leaders in the field. For 20 years, ACEEE and the Consortium for Energy Efficiency convened the National Symposium on Market Transformation so program practitioners and key stakeholders could share experiences and best practices.
We document successes and lessons learned
While there have been dramatic changes in some markets and technologies over the past 25 years, recent ACEEE research finds that the market transformation program model is still very relevant. In our new report, we present case studies of successful market transformations, including residential lighting, clothes washers, and high-performance schools, and draw lessons that can be applied to new opportunities.
Market transformation is complex, requiring a long-term commitment and collaboration among a large and diverse set of key stakeholders — typically at a regional or national scale. For example, transforming the market for front-loading clothes washers involved national leadership by the US Department of Energy and the Consortium for Energy Efficiency, along with collaboration from manufacturers, a group of western utilities, and selected cities. The approaches and strategic interventions vary; they typically include performance specifications, marketing campaigns, incentives for suppliers or retailers, product labeling, training, and/or demonstration projects. They also need a transition or exit strategy, which can include establishing or upgrading codes and standards.
The market transformation model, however, is not suited to all types of products and services. For example, it has had limited success with home energy efficiency retrofits because of challenges faced by consumers and contractors.  
Where to go from here?
Despite successes, market transformation is not currently the prevalent model for customer energy efficiency programs. More common are “resource acquisition” efforts that save energy measure by measure or customer by customer. Utility programs can use both approaches, which can complement and build on each other.
Regulatory support remains the biggest challenge to transforming markets. Its interventions occur over a long period and do not sync with shorter utility and regulatory program cycles. Another challenge is establishing market baselines for measuring impact. Market transformation requires different approaches to evaluation, measurement, and verification to demonstrate impacts and garner support.
As our utility industry is being transformed, we can apply market transformation to continue to increase the efficiency of products, services, and practices. Numerous forces shape the markets all around us. Market transformation can be one force to guide markets toward higher energy efficiency, which saves consumers energy and money.

Our new three-part video series explores the health impacts of energy efficiency;"In a new three-part video series, ACEEE explores how energy efficiency can improve people’s health. We hear the stories of homeowners in three states. To look at efficiency’s impact in rural areas, Part One takes us to McDowell County, West Virginia.
In the southernmost tip of West Virginia, where the state’s poverty rates are highest, Brenda Kelsor struggles with chronic breathing problems. She has bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and her home — an old trailer — was only making matters worse. It lacked central air conditioning and insulation so she found it difficult to breathe in both summer and winter, noting, “It’s hard to breathe ... if it’s too hot or too cold.” After her home was weatherized, its indoor temperature remained pleasant and her utility bills decreased. “Oh, my god, it feels good in here,” she said about the difference. “This is going to help.”
Like Kelsor, many residents of rural areas such as McDowell County have inefficient homes with high energy bills. Efficiency upgrades not only save homeowners money but also can improve their health. Curtis Lindsey, the weatherization program coordinator for the Council of the Southern Mountains, said many local residents can’t afford to move or fix their homes. “They are freezing every winter. They’re burning up every summer. And weatherization can help people in that situation.”
The conditions inside a home can have a big impact on a person’s health, affecting exposure to indoor air pollution, allergens, disease-carrying vermin, and other hazards. Energy efficiency upgrades can make buildings safer and healthier. Weatherizing a home involves sealing up holes and cracks that can allow cold air — or pests — into the home. A residential energy efficiency program typically also repairs or upgrades appliances. This can reduce utility bills and eliminate health hazards caused when malfunctioning furnaces and hot water heaters spew carbon monoxide into a home.
Professionals like Mr. Lindsey who deliver weatherization services are typically trained in building systems and sciences. They identify hazards in a home and fix them.  For example, they identify causes of moisture and ensure proper ventilation so that when the home is tightly sealed, air quality is maintained and mold doesn’t grow. These benefits are especially significant for vulnerable individuals such as the elderly, children, and people with respiratory illnesses, including asthma. By reducing a family’s utility bills, these efficiency improvements can also help those struggling to put food on the table.
In coming weeks, ACEEE will release the second and third parts in our video series on how energy efficiency is protecting health and changing lives. We look at outdoor air pollution in Pittsburgh and childhood asthma in Baltimore. These three videos will be posted on our new Health and Environment webpage. We will continue this discussion throughout 2018 with groundbreaking research and a first-ever Conference on Health, Environment, and Energy in New Orleans. We invite you to become part of the discussion as we explore the health and environmental impacts of saving energy.

The hidden gem of wholesale energy markets: Energy efficiency;"A recent federal proposal puts a spotlight on an uncommonly popular topic: wholesale energy markets. Our new research shows that energy efficiency has provided steadily increasing value to grid operators and customers in two such markets. Our report, Energy Efficiency in Capacity Auctions: A Historical Review of Value, finds that since they have been included, efficiency resources have almost tripled in the Mid-Atlantic auction and almost quadrupled in a similar auction in New England.
Capacity auctions: overview
Grid operators — known as independent system operators (ISOs) or regional transmission organizations — hold auctions to procure future energy resources at the wholesale level. The grid operators for the Mid-Atlantic and New England, PJM and ISO-New England (ISO-NE), procure such resources through mandatory auctions where providers bid on selling capacity to the grid at the auction’s clearing price. Across the country, these providers are mostly electricity generation sources like natural gas or coal plants, solar farms, and hydroelectricity facilities. In the case of PJM and ISO-NE, they also include demand-side resources such as energy efficiency and demand response. We explore how the inclusion of energy efficiency in these auctions reduces system-wide prices and retail customer rates. We use an example from Baltimore Gas and Electric to look at how efficiency in capacity auctions translates directly to bill savings for residential customers.
As more energy efficiency clears these auctions, its providers gain revenue and incentive to invest in additional efficiency. The figure below shows how much energy efficiency has cleared in each auction (this does not include any demand response resources).
Energy efficiency cleared in the PJM and ISO-NE capacity auctions
How does load forecasting fit in?
These growing energy efficiency resources, as well as those not bid into the auctions (which are captured in the region’s load forecast), reliably reduce the amount of energy demanded in the PJM and ISO-NE areas. Low-cost efficiency reduces both the number of units procured in the capacity auctions and the price paid to all resources. This ultimately lowers prices for customers and can accrue to large savings across a region. One analysis showed, for example, that using energy efficiency to meet Ohio’s regulatory standards would save $1.3 billion through the year 2020. We highlight historical and current issues in how efficiency is represented (or underrepresented) in load forecasting methodologies, as well as examples of the benefits of accounting for efficiency in both the load forecast and the capacity auctions.
Efficiency’s future: the value proposition
Evaluating the effects of energy efficiency in wholesale markets is especially important right now. In September, the US Department of Energy asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to create a rule to provide financial rewards for resources with long-term reserves of fuel onsite. This was intended to give an advantage to resources like coal and nuclear power in wholesale energy markets. The guidance has caused many energy market actors to evaluate the needs of the grid and how different resources might meet them. Our report highlights reasons efficiency should be expanded in these markets, rather than reduced (as might be the case if other resources receive new financial incentives), and the beneficial role that efficiency resources are increasingly playing in wholesale markets.

ACEEE Statement in Appreciation of Marc Ross;"The ACEEE family is saddened to learn that ACEEE’s founding board member Professor Marc Ross passed away this week. Marc was a beloved giant in the energy efficiency community who made a significant and lasting impact. He was a professor of physics at the University of Michigan and senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. Marc worked on the theory of fundamental particles until 1972 when his interests shifted to energy use and its environmental implications, leading him to help organize ACEEE.
Marc served on the ACEEE board from 1980 until 2005, and as board member, served as ACEEE’s first research director. He was instrumental in the establishment of our Transportation and Industry research programs while mentoring many of the staff. Marc’s work in the 1990s demonstrated the enormous potential to improve the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engine vehicles. In the 2000s, he brought basic principles of physics to bear in debunking the claim that higher Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would make vehicles less safe. He thereby helped set the stage for the first increase in the standards in 30 years in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.
Marc would show up regularly in Washington DC and make the rounds, visiting ACEEE, Department of Energy, Public Citizen—in fact, anyone ready to roll up his or her sleeves on the energy problems of the day. He was a delight to speak with, always doing something useful and novel, and always genuinely interested in getting one’s input. He had a twinkle in his very blue eyes and a smile on his face. He was truly a kind, gentle man. Marc’s legacy in energy efficiency lives on today in the work of ACEEE and many others in the efficiency community.
  The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.

New data, same results – Saving energy is still cheaper than making energy.;"Keeping the lights on for customers is every electric utility’s top priority. To do so, utilities have choices. They can build power plants to convert fossil fuels to energy. They can capture renewable resources like solar and wind. And they can work with their customers to more efficiently use energy, meeting demand by saving energy rather than generating it.
ACEEE research has shown a dramatic growth in energy efficiency’s role in the electric sector. We estimate that today it’s the United States’ third largest electricity resource – contributing more to our grid than nuclear power. But it’s not just one of our most common resources, it’s also typically the lowest-cost way to meet customers’ energy needs. New data by Lazard on levelized costs of electricity supply resources released in November 2017 confirms that by helping customers install efficient appliances, insulate their homes and buildings, and refine operations and maintenance practices, utilities are still investing in the lowest-cost energy resource out there.
Levelized Cost of Electricity Resources
Energy efficiency investments aimed at reducing energy waste cost utilities two to five cents per kilowatt hour (an average of about three cents), while generating the same amount of electricity from sources such as fossil fuels can cost two to three times more. It isn’t a surprising result that energy efficiency continues to stack up as the lowest-cost resource. Recent research from ACEEE found that even among utilities achieving the highest levels of electricity savings from efficiency, the cost of saved energy has remained consistently low. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has found similar results.
Investments in energy efficiency can have a big effect. In fact, the investments we’ve made in energy efficiency between 1990 and today have helped us to avoid building the equivalent of 313 large power plants and have delivered cumulative savings of nearly $790 billion to customers across the country.
Energy efficiency has a host of other benefits, too. It’s clean, readily available, and reliable. It can increase comfort in homes and offices, and spur economic development in cities and towns. Utilities that invest in energy efficiency do so because it makes financial sense for them, but the payoffs accrue to everyone.

New technologies are poised to track the many benefits of saving energy;"Intelligent efficiency technologies such as learning thermostats and smart watches are making it easier to track and quantify the many benefits of saving energy. Fitness trackers are allowing researchers to evaluate the health benefits, new software apps are enabling building managers to check occupant comfort, and social media posts are helping utilities address resiliency concerns by assessing the scope of power outages.
Our new report, Use of Intelligent Efficiency to Collect and Analyze Nonenergy Benefits Information, explores how new technologies and Big Data can be used to analyze energy efficiency program benefits. These technologies reduce the time and expense of a robust cost-benefit analysis of a program’s nonenergy benefits (NEBs), and thus can attract additional program funding. By making energy efficiency more attractive, they can help boost energy savings for individuals, utilities, and society.
We examine how automated data collection and processing — enabled by smart devices, inexpensive sensors, networks, and cloud computing — can quantify how energy efficiency improves a range of attributes, such as worker productivity, building occupant health, and the environment. We show how such NEBs data can boost program marketing and customer relations.
This report builds on prior ACEEE research on intelligent efficiency and the multiple benefits of energy efficiency. We look at the potential impacts of new techniques for data gathering on energy efficiency programs. Not surprisingly, we found that some applications may change how NEBs are included in the evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) of energy efficiency programs, a topic we have touched on in previous work.
One new opportunity is assessing and responding to occupant comfort in office buildings while also optimizing energy use. Comfort can be assessed by monitoring indoor air quality and tracking occupants via software, motion detectors, and wearables with biometric monitors such as smart watches and fitness trackers.
Worker comfort influences productivity, which influences an employer’s likeliness to stay in a building or facility. Higher tenant satisfaction and lower energy costs can improve a property owner’s return on investment.
Researchers are also using these technologies to assess occupant health. Energy efficient buildings have been shown to have healthier indoor air and by saving energy, they improve outdoor air by reducing the need for fossil fuels and associated emissions. Utilities are using geospatial software programs and analyzing social media posts to assess the scope of power outages, which can pose health risks to occupants and economic hardship for communities. Evaluators may soon be able to leverage all of these technologies to assess even more societal benefits.
New technologies and practices can lower the costs of data collection and bring to scale many energy savings measures. Improved analysis and dissemination of NEBs information can broaden support for energy efficiency programs, make them more effective, decrease energy use, and as a result, improve the US economy and environment.

Stories behind the rankings: These successes reveal benefits of saving energy;"Residents and businesses across the country are saving energy and money thanks to smart state policies. Their stories help explain why some states climbed in our 2017 State Scorecard or maintained strong standings. This year for the first time, we included stories of individuals and communities in our state-specific score sheets. We found schools that improved lighting and taught students about sustainability, state facilities that secured more reliable electricity, and senior citizens who improved the comfort of their homes. These stories demonstrate the impact of energy efficiency policies and programs on our wallets, local economies, productivity, and quality of life.
Schools
Idaho was one of the most-improved states in the 2017 Scorecard, partly because utilities have increased spending on energy efficiency. In late 2016 the University of Idaho leveraged a utility rebate to convert more than 66,000 fluorescent lights to more-efficient LEDs (light emitting diodes). The program employed 22 students and installed higher-quality lights that minimize ultraviolet radiation and reduce the university’s carbon footprint. The project is expected to save the university more than $355,000 annually and reduce energy use by 5.6 million kilowatt hours. It had a side benefit as well. It showed Peter Handel, a student employed by the project, the value of energy efficiency and sparked his longer-term interest in the field.
Similarly, in southwest Oregon, the Medford School District used Energy Trust of Oregon incentives and services to upgrade lights, renovate and construct energy-efficient school buildings, and improve occupant energy consumption practices. The school district used this program as a tool for teaching students about saving energy.
Homes
Another impressive story occurred in Kentucky, where the Ivy Knolls Senior Living Community replaced lighting and made energy efficiency upgrades to its elevator and heating and cooling system. The Ivy Knolls project was the first in the state to leverage Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing, which the Kentucky legislature enabled in 2015. Ray Schneider, the president of Ivy Knolls, was excited to improve resident comfort, reduce energy use by 37%, and save more than $12,000 annually.

In Nevada, homeowner Michael Jones replaced his windows and insulation through that state’s Home Energy Retrofit Opportunities for Seniors (H.E.R.O.S.) program. Now when his area gets windy, his house no longer rattles and he sleeps better at night. 
Public Buildings
Illinois also rose in this year’s State Scorecard rankings, in part because of its Public Sector Combined Heat and Power (CHP) pilot program. In 2017 the state brought three CHP plants online. One of these systems replaced a 50-year-old coal and natural gas plant at Argonne National Lab and will supply 20% of the lab’s electricity and 80% of its steam heat. This plant has provided a more-secure power supply for sensitive experiments and will save the lab more than $52 million over 15 years. Another CHP plant at the Glenbard Wastewater Treatment Plant has already begun to save energy and reduce operating costs.
Delaware is another state that has led by example in reducing energy use in public facilities. In 2017, as the result of an executive order charging state agencies to lead on sustainability, a 146-year-old agency building became the first Delaware-owned building to become LEED certified in the category of Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance. It has reduced energy use by 40%.
These are just a few of the stories that show how energy efficiency has served people and businesses. From farms to firehouses, airports to art museums, and houses to hospitals, it makes buildings more affordable to operate, easier to maintain, and more pleasant to occupy. By enacting energy efficiency policies and investing in efficiency programs, states can deliver this value to their citizens. Want to hear more stories about what your state is doing?

More fun than solar: The sun shines on ACEEE's energy efficiency conference in Arizona;"ACEEE’s 2017 National Conference on Energy Efficiency as a Resource, held October 30-November 1 near Phoenix, Arizona, explored several emerging areas in the field, such as the health-related benefits of saving energy. This ninth biennial ACEEE “EER” Conference, like prior ones since 2001, featured a packed agenda. ACEEE has posted all the presentations on our web site, available for free public access.
Arizona proved to be a terrific host site. Welcome remarks were provided by a representative of the Arizona Governor’s office as well as by the chairman of the Arizona Corporation Commission. Over 325 attendees heard an opening keynote speech by Pat Vincent-Collawn, president and CEO of PNM Resources and recently elected chairman of the board of Edison Electric Institute, who shared her perspective as a key industry executive and head of the primary electric industry trade association. Attendees also enjoyed the second day luncheon keynote by Chris Benjamin, chief sustainability officer of Pacific Gas & Electric. His topic, “The Utility Sector as a Climate Solutions Provider: Harnessing Energy Efficiency,” seemed particularly timely in a year that saw multiple unprecedented weather disasters in the United States.  
The agenda also featured presentations from more than 90 professionals in the utility energy efficiency field, who covered a wide array of topics during 25 breakout sessions. Examples include key state policies to encourage utility energy efficiency efforts, energy efficiency as a transmission and distribution resource, innovative and emerging energy efficiency approaches, measuring the resource value of energy efficiency, and examples of highly successful energy efficiency programs for each customer sector.
Several new areas of focus drew particular attention. With regard to the health-related benefits of energy efficiency (Session 2D), an area of growing interest in the field, presenters provided practical examples and current tools for quantifying those effects. Other sessions explored the increasingly important related issues of energy efficiency as a distributed resource (Session 2C) and the time-sensitive aspect of valuing energy efficiency as a utility resource (Session 4A). Another session focused on new developments in cost-effectiveness testing (Session 3D), including a presentation on the recently released National Standard Practice Manual (NSPM). We encourage readers to check out these and other conference presentations at http://aceee.org/conferences/2017/eer.
This year’s EER conference documented once again that energy efficiency continues to be the lowest-cost (and cleanest) utility system resource across the United States. ACEEE expresses a hearty “thank you” to all who supported and participated in this conference! (And stay tuned for future announcements about our 2019 EER Conference.)

Fuel economy is going up. Vehicle prices are holding steady.;"n responding to an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action on vehicle standards, ACEEE found that average vehicle prices have remained essentially flat over the past 15 years, even as average fuel economy improves. The finding rebuts multiple claims from the auto industry that boosting vehicle fuel economy makes cars and trucks unaffordable for American consumers. Our analysis is once again relevant as federal agencies, acting on the Trump administration’s decision to review fuel economy standards, have resumed evaluating the appropriateness and feasibility of existing regulations and greenhouse gas emission requirements of cars and light trucks. Our finding complements the agencies’ 2016 technical report, which found that savings at the pump from better fuel economy would far offset the cost of the technologies needed to meet the standards. Bottom line: Consumers are saving money, and affordable vehicle choices remain.
Fuel economy naysayers have seized on vehicle price trends, often ignoring essential features of the data. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which pushed the Trump administration to reopen the standards, has claimed repeatedly that the average car today costs 60% more than the average car in the early 1990s, driven partly by the standards. Among recent industry comments to the EPA, Global Automakers claims that prices “continue to climb,” and that further increases will jeopardize new vehicle sales, pricing some out of the new vehicle market entirely. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy think tank, asserts that fuel economy regulations increased the cost to purchase a model year 2016 vehicle by at least $3,800 and that future standards will put new cars out of reach of millions of lower-income households.
But after nearly a decade of growth since the recession and back-to-back years of all-time record sales, the claim that Americans are being priced out of the market warrants a closer look. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has collected data on consumer expenditures for new cars going back to 1967 and for new light trucks since 2002. We use the consumer price index to adjust the BEA data for inflation, leading to the information presented in the figure below. Outside of the Great Recession, the average price of vehicles purchased by consumers in real dollars has in fact remained nearly flat since 2002.
The average price paid for new vehicles reflects many factors, but consumer preference for better-equipped vehicles and longer loan terms that decrease monthly payments are two of the primary drivers. The price dip during the recession reflects fewer sales of expensive cars and trucks in favor of more modest vehicles. The effect on average prices of 2009’s federal “Cash for Clunkers” rebate program is also apparent, where average expenditure dropped with the generous rebate. More recently, consumers are buying more trucks instead of cars, and trucks are typically more expensive than cars. If Americans had continued to buy the same mix of cars and trucks as they did in 2009, the average vehicle purchase price of the entire light-duty fleet (represented by the orange line) would have been roughly $1,900 lower during the first months of 2017 than it was. In fact, average vehicle price could have been at its lowest point, outside of the recession, since BEA began tracking truck prices in 2002.
For cars alone, prices have been on a downward trajectory since 1998, well before the recession or the increase in fuel economy requirements. The claim by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers that car prices have increased by 60% since the 1990s just doesn’t hold up — unless you ignore inflation and prevalent consumer incentives offered by automakers. The figure below shows that, in real dollars, the average price for a car “out the door” (what people actually pay, including rebates and fees) is 16% lower today than in the early 1990s. 
For trucks, the data show that the average transaction price has increased by about 7% from pre-recession levels. Many consumers are choosing to buy vehicles that simply didn’t exist a decade ago, such as $67,000 luxury pickup trucks with massaging seats and Wi-Fi, which further inflates the average price of trucks.
That doesn’t mean affordable new vehicles have disappeared, however. Consumers Union recently found that the price of entry-level vehicles is largely unchanged over the past 10 years. Despite increasing fuel economy requirements, affordable vehicle options remain. Policymakers need to remain diligent in scrutinizing the industry’s misleading claims and ensure continued progress towards clean, efficient vehicles.
The auto industry has a history of crying wolf when required to make changes that  preserve our health, wealth, and safety. While new technology costs money, such costs are typically lower than predicted and, in addition, come down over time as the technology matures. There simply has been no vast increase in the average price of new vehicles, and affordable options remain. The industry continues to produce new vehicles that are safer, cleaner, and more fuel efficient, and with an extensive array of new comfort and entertainment features. Even though high truck sales are slowing gains in average fuel economy, new vehicle buyers — even those buying trucks — are saving money thanks to the standards.

Millions of people work to save energy: Here are some of their stories;"In every state, across industries and technologies, millions of people work to save energy in the United States. To highlight this diverse and growing workforce, ACEEE is releasing today a multimedia project, People Who Save Energy. We tell the stories of some of these workers, who describe how energy efficiency changed their lives and those around them.
Consider the Tate family. Richard Tate, who had been struggling to find a job, found out about a six-week weatherization class after his mom’s home was weatherized. He earned a perfect score in the class and landed a full-time job weatherizing homes. “It’s just a beautiful thing to see the smiles on their faces and know you’re causing them to save some money,” he said of his customers.
Richard's mom, Blanche Tate-Lee, saved enough money on her reduced utility bills to buy Christmas presents for her grandchildren. She also helped spur the US economy by using her energy savings to install blinds, paint the house, and make one other renovation: “I gave my husband his man cave.”
While Richard's family lives in Winston-Salem, NC, its story can happen anywhere in America, from small towns to big cities. At least 2.2 million people work all or part of their time on energy efficiency, according to a 2017 report for the US Department of Energy. They outnumber the 1.9 million whose jobs produce electricity, coal, natural gas, and gasoline. And DOE projects that the efficiency workforce will continue to increase, by 9% this year alone.
For ACEEE's People Who Save Energy project, we visited North Carolina to explore the wide range of efficiency work. We met manufacturers, builders, designers, trainers, weatherization workers, and the beneficiaries of their efforts, including a church pastor. All of them are passionate about saving energy.
  Harriet O'Rear
“We want to bring advanced building materials to the residential market,” said Charles Leahy, CEO of Eco-Panels, which makes structural insulated panels. When Harriett O’Rear built her home in Snow Camp, NC, she chose the factory-built, airtight SIPs over stick-frame construction: “It’s easy, it’s efficient, it’s not particularly costly.”
More than half of direct energy efficiency jobs are in construction. The others are found in manufacturing, professional and business services, or trade, distribution, and transport. In addition, DOE reports another 0.7 million jobs that focus on vehicle fuel economy and alternative fuel vehicles, plus 3 million jobs that sell efficient (and other) appliances and building materials.
Taylor Fearrington
“My main job is to help developers and builders design, build, and ultimately sell a more efficient home,” said Taylor Fearrington of Southern Energy Management. Another person we talked to, Vince DiFrancesco of Everblue Training, teaches people to build more efficient, comfortable, and healthier homes. He said more and more builders are interested in energy efficiency because they can market its multiple benefits.
Energy efficiency creates indirect jobs, too. By reducing energy use and utility bills, it lets consumers like Blanche Tate-Lee spend or invest their savings elsewhere in the economy. The savings from energy efficiency often yield more jobs than the efficiency work itself.
Rob Rogers takes pride in the money his company, ESRA Facility Management & Consulting, Inc., saves customers through energy audits and retrofits. One of those beneficiaries is Reverend Jemonde Taylor, the rector of St. Ambrose Episcopal Church in Raleigh, NC.
“We can look from 2012 to 2017 and see how our energy use has gone down because of certain things we have done,” Taylor said, noting the repair of cracked stained-glass windows and the HVAC system. “Over time the congregation will be able to save money and live with a clean and clear conscience that we are doing something positive.”
  Tiffany Perrin
A retired US Air Force officer, Rob Rogers also takes heart in putting people like Tiffany Perrin to work. Perrin, who has experience as a residential carpenter, said weatherization has improved her craft: “A carpenter’s a joiner. So you’re learning how to more properly join . . . and why it’s so important for the house to be sealed.”
Perrin said her work helps some people from becoming homeless by making it easier for them to pay utility bills and other expenses. And their homes are less drafty and more comfortable. “People need to know what we really do, especially the . . . health benefits of it,” she said. “I appreciate what this field is about. I’m hoping that eventually it will spread and get a lot bigger.”

Rollback of truck standards is bad news for fuel efficiency and air quality;"The Environmental Protection Agency is taking the first of possibly several steps that could set back fuel efficiency for heavy-duty trucks, increase air pollution, and create market uncertainty for the trucking industry. At issue is the second phase of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) standards for heavy-duty trucks, adopted in 2016. These standards are estimated to save 800,000 barrels of oil per day by 2040, thereby reducing fleet operating costs and hence the cost of goods.
Within the past week, the Office of Management and Budget received an EPA proposed rule to repeal emissions requirements for “glider vehicles”. A glider vehicle is a tractor chassis with frame, axle, cab, and brakes that becomes a highway truck when engine and transmission salvaged from earlier model years are installed. Repealing the glider provisions would allow trucking companies — contrary to Phase 2 of emissions standards — to install an older, outdated, high-emitting engine into a new truck body and avoid regulations that would apply to an entirely new truck.
This provision is especially damaging for air quality, since most glider manufacturers use remanufactured diesel engines from 2001 or earlier, which emit 20-40 times as much nitrogen oxide and particulate matter as today’s new diesel engines. Exposure to particulates can affect both our lungs and our hearts, while nitrogen oxide exposure could lead to development of asthma and increase respiratory infections.
The EPA has also said it plans to revisit the trailer standards in the Phase 2 program. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, in August, wrote to the Tractor Trailer Manufacturing Association (TTMA): “EPA has decided to revisit the Phase 2 trailer provisions in general, and the issue of the EPA’s authority to regulate trailers in particular.” Meanwhile, TTMA has challenged the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 heavy-duty standards in court and asked for a stay order. Trailers account for a big chunk of the truck standards’ GHG savings, as we highlighted in a recent blog post. We estimate that, should the trailer standards get rolled back, future tractor-trailers would consume approximately 40,000 additional barrels of oil per day by 2025. Trailer standards rely on readily available technologies that pay for themselves within two years.
Aside from causing a sharp increase in air pollution, reopening the Phase 2 standards will introduce uncertainty to the industry. The American Trucking Association supported the successful Phase 1 rule and worked closely with EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to build on that success with Phase 2. The association expressed concern that reopening Phase 2 could set the stage for California to impose a more stringent trailer standard. Indeed, California is already on track to adopt a state rule that will largely harmonize with the federal Phase 2 standards. “The lawsuit and reconsideration of the trailer provisions however, does not affect California’s authority to establish standards for trailers hauled by heavy‐duty tractors and CARB is accordingly proposing to establish specific requirements for trailers,” the California Air Resources Board asserted in a recent workshop. In the event of a federal rollback, California will consider new requirements on fleets operating in California that their trailers incorporate efficiency improvements that the Phase 2 program, as originally adopted, would have delivered.
Absent standards, many trailer manufacturers will decline to invest in efficiency improvements in a market where upfront cost and split incentives can blunt the demand for efficiency. Removing trailers from standards would also jeopardize a major remaining fuel efficiency opportunity, namely aerodynamic improvements through integration of tractor and advanced trailer. The Department of Energy’s SuperTruck program demonstrated that such integration could increase fuel savings by over 20% beyond Phase 2 levels. In the absence of trailer regulation, future standards will work hard to eke out 3-5% fuel savings from engine improvements while forgoing large, relatively low-cost savings from aerodynamics.

Low-income efficiency programs that work;"Energy efficiency programs are especially important for low-income customers. Well-designed programs can help relieve the significant energy burdens faced by low-income families and also provide benefits like increased comfort and healthier homes. But getting these programs right takes careful planning. Low-income customers face several major barriers to participation in utility efficiency programs, ranging from lack of resources for efficiency upgrades to aging housing stock that may need health and safety improvements.
In a new report, we highlight utility programs that are successfully reaching a large number of low-income customers and delivering deep energy savings to participants. These programs are located across the country and serve both electric and gas customers. They are delivered to customers by utilities, community action agencies, and statewide administrators. By conducting interviews and digging through data on participation, energy savings, and program spending, we distilled the key factors to which low-income program implementers credit their success. These factors include the following:
Simplifying interactions by assigning a single point of contact for customers and for contractors. Some programs work with only a single contractor, simplifying communication and ensuring a strong relationship between contractor and utility. Others noted that simplifying customer-facing communication is key. In Ohio, agencies implementing the Home Weatherization Assistance Program also deliver ratepayer-funded electric and natural gas efficiency programs, making comprehensive efficiency upgrades convenient and accessible for customers.
Offering targeted programs to different market segments. Several of the utilities and program implementers we interviewed offer a portfolio of low-income energy efficiency programs that focus on the unique needs of different customer types, including high energy users, elderly customers, renters, and owners of multifamily buildings. CenterPoint Energy in Minnesota, for example, offers five programs in its portfolio of low-income programs, including programs focused on non-profit affordable housing, multifamily housing, and single-family housing.
Emphasizing quality control and training. Several program administrators have strict quality control requirements for all projects rather than just a sample of projects, and many dedicate funding to ongoing training of contractors and partners. In Massachusetts, lead community action agencies in the Low-Income Energy Affordability Network (LEAN) employ full-time trainers to work with subcontractors across the state. LEAN also does quality control on every completed job.
Leveraging diverse funding sources to focus on comprehensive fuel-neutral upgrades. Many programs combine funding from several sources to address a comprehensive set of measures at each project site that might not be feasible with only a single funding source. Energy Outreach Colorado provides services to low-income residents in utility territories across the state, combining funding from utilities, the federal weatherization program, state and regional efforts, and private donations. This allows the nonprofit to deliver a comprehensive set of efficiency measures and address health and safety issues that might not be eligible for improvements using utility funding alone.
Forming partnerships to better market and deliver services to hard-to-reach customers. Many of the utilities we surveyed noted that they have formed partnerships with food banks, health organizations, and nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity. DTE Energy, in Michigan, also partners with the Alliance for Deaf Services to help promote its programs in American Sign Language and equip installers with technology that helps them communicate with deaf customers.
Other keys to success also rose to the top in our report, including coordinating statewide program delivery, accommodating health and safety measures, and prioritizing measures that achieve deep savings.
The programs we profile have had significant success, but many program implementers still noted the trade-off between maximizing participation and delivering deep savings to each program participant. Some have addressed the issue by including both low-cost direct-install measures and deep-retrofit programs in their low-income energy efficiency portfolios. Ultimately, however, many of these programs are limited by funding and need to choose the best way to direct their dollars and maximize impact.
Utilities seeking to deliver quality programs to low-income customers can look to the proven strategies described in our report to expand program reach and deliver deep savings. Regulators and lawmakers have a role to play, too. They can ensure that utilities are adequately funded to get the job done, providing a reliable funding source for low-income energy efficiency programs over the long term.

Innovation in evaluation accelerates as energy efficiency programs grow;"As gas and electric utilities increasingly rely on energy efficiency as a resource, innovative ways to evaluate its impacts are emerging. Our new report Recent Developments in Energy Efficiency Evaluation, Measurement, and Verification presents examples of what pioneering states and utilities are doing to address challenges and take steps to evolve in a changing utility landscape.
Over the past decade the use of energy efficiency as a utility resource has increased considerably. Consequently, rigorous evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) has gained importance as a way to help ensure that the resource is valid and the impacts are appropriately valued. ACEEE’s report assesses and documents recent developments in the field.
One of the most visible trends affecting EM&V is the proliferation of advanced technologies for generating and analyzing large amounts of energy consumption data. Particularly significant is the widespread implementation of advanced metering infrastructure (known as smart meters), together with other devices such as smart thermostats and various energy management systems. These technologies and the data they make available have made possible new approaches to energy data analytics, energy efficiency program designs, evaluation methods, and policy approaches.
We also identify states leading in EM&V.  Not surprisingly, many states leading in energy efficiency also invest heavily in program evaluation. For example, Massachusetts and California are consistent leaders in utility energy efficiency as well as EM&V policy and regulation. Several other states are tackling evaluation challenges and developing refined and collaborative approaches.
In a closely related development, often as a result of state policies, utilities are examining how they can best employ advanced measurement and verification, often called “M&V 2.0,” to estimate savings, better understand and engage customers, and target program marketing more effectively. In certain program applications of M&V 2.0, energy savings can be determined faster and in more detail. This faster performance feedback is enabling more agile and responsive program implementation.  
Another trend is the growth and enhancement of technical reference manuals (TRMs). TRMs are centralized repositories of energy efficiency savings values, methodologies, and parameters, usually built and maintained at the state level. More states and regions are adopting TRMs and enhancing the accuracy and consistency of their deemed savings values. They are benefitting from transparent, collaborative multi-stakeholder efforts to update efficiency measures and calibrate savings values. Jurisdictions are increasingly using the results from program evaluations to update TRMs in a cycle of continuous improvement.
Some aspects of EM&V practice have not changed as rapidly but are also important. To estimate energy savings, we need to first determine the baseline of energy consumption, which considers how much energy would have been used without efficiency measures. These baseline methods are crucial to EM&V’s work in a changing world, and we examine one such approach — the common practice baseline (CPB).
The methodologies and technologies used to apply EM&V to the energy efficiency resource are complex and rapidly evolving. Our report highlights recent developments in a few key areas of EM&V. The community faces many other challenges and opportunities as the utility industry evolves, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory recently reviewed them. While new techniques and approaches emerge over time, the fundamental objectives for EM&V are enduring: to document impacts and provide information for program improvement. Given the vast energy efficiency resources available, the future looks bright if EM&V policy and practice continue to advance.

The proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan shortchanges the benefits of energy efficiency;"The Environmental Protection Agency, in its proposal this week to repeal the Clean Power Plan, ignores the full benefits of energy efficiency — a key strategy for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Much of the repeal language focuses on a legal interpretation of the Clean Air Act that, if upheld, would likely take some of the best options for reducing emissions off the table.
The EPA also changes the calculus for determining the costs and benefits of the Clean Power Plan, an Obama administration effort to limit emissions from power plants. Many of the changes are nuanced, but overall, the new analysis would increase the plan’s estimated costs and reduce its benefits—notably, the health benefits.
The new EPA analysis overlooks the fact that by reducing energy waste, we cut not only carbon but also dangerous particulate emissions, soot, and mercury. These pollutants cause and worsen a variety of diseases affecting the heart, lungs, and brain. Reducing these pollutants protects public health and saves lives, but the EPA analysis turns a blind eye to many of those benefits.
Environmental groups and several states are expected to challenge the repeal proposal in court. In spite of a previous court decision requiring the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, it’s unclear whether the EPA will issue an alternative rule any time soon to address them.
The good news: Despite the EPA’s latest attempt to roll back environmental protections, the United States is moving to protect public health and address climate change. Coal plants are being retired and replaced with cleaner sources of electricity. More than 380 mayors have pledged to uphold the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. Many states and cities are taking action to limit carbon emissions, and are incorporating energy efficiency into their efforts:
California’s cap and trade program was recently extended through 2030. It cites the statewide doubling of energy efficiency as a central part of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In the Northeast, states are working together to limit emissions as part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. RGGI targets were also recently extended through 2030. These states recognize that energy efficiency is critical to meeting RGGI goals. Six of the nine RGGI states ranked in the top 10 in our most recent State Scorecard.
New York City, a “We’re Still In” city, has already delivered a plan to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. The plan accelerates the city’s reduction of emissions in line with the agreement. It relies heavily on increasing energy efficiency in buildings and transportation.
Boston mayor Martin Walsh, as part of his city’s efforts to be carbon neutral by 2050, committed to adhering to the Paris Climate Agreement. Energy efficiency remains a leading strategy to meet these goals.
As communities struggle with unprecedented flooding and fire, we will increasingly need solutions that improve electric reliability, reduce pollution, and eliminate health and safety risks. City and state leaders recognize that they can’t afford to wait while the EPA tinkers with its math. Recognizing the inevitability of regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions, Ted J. Thomas, chairman of the Arkansas Public Service Commission, might have put it best: “You can either be prepared or unprepared,” he added, “and that’s a pretty simple choice.”

Why do people invest in home energy upgrades? We have answers;"It’s not just about money. People invest in home energy upgrades for a variety of reasons, including reconstruction after heavy storms. Our new report explores their motivations and unveils, based partly on a representative survey of nearly 2,000 homeowners, the best strategies for encouraging them to invest in energy efficiency.
People who invest in home energy upgrades want to save money on their utility bills, but they also want to improve their health, make their homes more comfortable, protect the environment, or mitigate climate change. In some cases, they are more likely to invest in upgrades when home energy assessors explain the nonfinancial benefits.
Our report, How to Talk About Home Energy Upgrades, shows that the framing of these messages matters. For example, the terms comfort or health may not motivate homeowners, but homeowners are motivated to get rid of cold drafts, remove mold, reduce allergy symptoms, and insulate against noise, among other issues.
  The optimal messaging is customized to the homeowner. We found that residents of the Southern United States, for example, responded best to messages highlighting the specific health and comfort benefits of upgrades. In different regions, other messages are sometimes more effective.
In addition to studying which benefits to highlight, we also tested subtle message-framing strategies. Homeowners were more interested in home energy updates under the following conditions:
They were already committed.  When homeowners were asked to imagine that the total cost of energy efficiency upgrades was $3,800 (rather than $2,500), but that they were also already committed to $1,300 in necessary repairs, they were significantly more likely to opt for the additional efficiency upgrade. The total efficiency upgrade cost was still only $2,500, but the willingness to upgrade increased by a small but significant amount when homeowners were first asked to think about the combined $3,800 price tag. This simple reframing shows that the cost of upgrades, in itself, is not the only factor in homeowner decision making.
A webinar discussing the report's findings 
Our webinar will discuss the latest research on the best ways to frame home energy upgrade recommendations, including results from our recent homeowner survey. Read more about this topic in the most recent report by Dr. Reuven Sussman and Maxine Chikumbo in the Behavior and Human Dimensions program at ACEEE.
Register for the webinar here!
  People make decisions by comparing their options to other similar options. If home energy assessors can influence homeowners’ frames of comparison, then they can influence their home upgrade decisions. This partly explains why the $2,500 efficiency upgrade decision presented above seems more appealing — we encouraged a comparison to a $3,800 option rather than nothing.
The “no-brainer” upgrades were removed from the list and replaced by “stretch” upgrade options. We found a similar result when we showed homeowners a list of potential home efficiency upgrades that might be recommended after an audit. Some upgrades had savings-to-investment ratios 12 times higher than the next highest on the list. What effect might this have on a homeowner’s perception of the other items? Well, we found that when we removed those “no-brainer” items from the list, homeowners were significantly more likely to pick the items that were previously neglected.
Nonfinancial benefits were also presented. Financial factors in home energy upgrade decisions might be less important than commonly thought. When we framed the benefits of home upgrades as being purely financial, homeowners were significantly more willing to invest in them than if we presented no specific benefits of upgrading (a control condition). However we found a similar effect when homeowners read a message about the health or comfort benefits of upgrading. Selling home energy upgrades based on their health or comfort benefits may be just as effective as touting their financial benefits in some cases.
Indeed, some home energy efficiency experts, marketers, and contractors have suggested for years that home upgrades should not be marketed purely on their cost-saving value. In many cases, the nonfinancial benefits of home upgrades are greater than the financial benefits, and focusing the conversation with homeowners on finances may limit their options.
The best way to encourage home energy upgrades is to listen to homeowners and learn what motivates them. Recommending upgrades that address their specific concerns maximizes the chances of investment.

Contractors and home energy assessors may want to download our tip sheet for quick info. We will also host a panel on this topic at the Behavior, Energy and Climate Change conference in Sacramento on October 1 as well as a webinar to explain the results in greater detail on November 7.

Energy efficiency can keep housing affordable for Maryland’s low-income families;"Energy efficiency retrofits for entire homes and buildings can substantially reduce energy bills for low-income and multifamily residents. These upgrades can also keep families in their homes by helping them avoid eviction, get through storms, and live longer and healthier lives.
For several years, Maryland’s Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) has delivered programs that improve the energy efficiency of homes for limited-income residents and keep rents affordable. Our new report chronicles the development, achievements, and challenges of these programs. This report comes at a critical time. The Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) is currently reviewing DHCD’s proposed program plan for the next three years.
To inform our research, we collected information from key Maryland stakeholders, reviewed program filings, and discussed program operations with energy efficiency professionals in Maryland and around the country. We also include lessons learned from our past research of low-income and multifamily programs.
Maryland’s Commitment to Saving Energy for Low-Income Families
After Maryland’s state legislature passed the EmPOWER Maryland Energy Efficiency Act in 2008, the Maryland PSC directed the state’s utility energy efficiency programs to focus on serving limited-income residents. In 2012, the PSC transferred administration of these programs to DHCD, citing its success in delivering weatherization and affordable housing programs. Since that time, DHCD has overseen two EmPOWER programs — the Low Income Energy Efficiency Program (LIEEP) for single-family homes and the Multifamily Energy Efficiency and Housing Affordability (MEEHA) program that targets affordable apartment buildings.
Achievements and Opportunities for Improved Program Performance
Throughout the last five years, households participating in LIEEP and MEEHA have seen significant energy savings because of DHCD’s commitment to comprehensive whole-home and whole-building upgrades. Still, each program’s participation numbers can increase.
Customer participation in LIEEP has been inconsistent over the past several years. To address this, we make several recommendations:
Increase spending or allow more flexibility in addressing home health and safety issues
Increase coordination with community groups
Strengthen engagement with owners of rental properties
MEEHA program participation is low compared to similar multifamily programs described in our recent low-income programs assessment. Energy savings per participant have also been declining over the past several years. Our report highlights several ways these issues can be addressed:
Deliver program incentives to master-metered multifamily buildings
Provide more support for multifamily applicants who are planning an energy efficiency project
Provide new training opportunities for multifamily contractors
Lastly, our report discusses several changes that can pave the way for future success in both programs. DHCD has very limited funding to improve the efficiency of natural gas equipment, but natural gas utilities, with support from the PSC, can direct greater resources to DHCD’s programs.
Program staff can also use new program performance metrics and information from third-party evaluations to guide future program decisions. With such new data, the PSC will be able to set informed energy savings and spending goals for DHCD’s programs.
Lessons for All
According to a recent National Low Income Housing Coalition study, Maryland is the fourth most-expensive state in the country for rent and utilities. Many of the state’s low-income families struggle to pay their bills and need energy efficiency programs like those administered through DHCD. Maryland ranks 10th in this year’s State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, and it is well positioned to decrease the energy burdens faced by so many low-income residents. However, these challenges are not unique to Maryland. Rent and energy costs are rising across the nation, while those with the lowest incomes see little or no increase in their pay. Our report offers valuable lessons for low-income program administrators and regulators in any state.

In Run on Less roadshow, trucks topped 10 mpg in real-world driving;"The first-ever Run on Less roadshow demonstrated just how fuel-efficient a tractor-trailer can be in real-world operation. Seven Class 8 Freightliner, International, and Volvo tractor trucks drove 50,000 miles across the country, carrying more than 55,000 lbs. of goods on average, and converged in Atlanta on Sunday for the grand finale. While roadshow organizers North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE) and Carbon War Room were aiming for 9 miles per gallon, the trucks averaged more than 10 miles per gallon — in real-world operation and in real weather, including encounters with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
Some major takeaways from the event:
Tractor trucks can achieve high fuel efficiency using today’s commercially available technologies. All seven participating trucks achieved more than 10 miles per gallon during the roadshow, and two trucks topped 11 miles per gallon. These trucks were equipped with 2014-2018 model year engines, automated manual transmissions, and 53-foot trailers with skirts and trailer tails (except one truck). No doubt, the participation of some of the best drivers in the profession — NACFE Executive Director Mike Roeth dubbed them “the Jack Nicklauses of trucking” — bumped up the miles per gallon substantially. Nevertheless, today’s emerging truck technologies can help all drivers approach the results of the masters.
Run on Less validates Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation’s Phase 2 standards for tractor trucks. National standards adopted in 2016 would improve average new tractor-trailer certified fuel economy to 8.2 miles per gallon in 2027 from the present level of 6 miles per gallon, assuming current efforts to undermine the standards are unsuccessful. Run on Less trucks handily beat the 2027 target with today’s commercially available technologies. While roadshow trucks were not operated in the precise conditions specified in the standards, exceeding 2027 fuel economy levels in on-road driving is a highly significant achievement. In fact, Run on Less trucks approached the 12 miles per gallon efficiencies demonstrated in DOE’s SuperTruck program with the help of technologies not yet commercialized.
Truckers can save big at the pump. Many tractor-trailers drive 120,000-150,000 miles annually and can be on the road for 10 years or more. Consequently, a one-mile-per-gallon increase can provide big bucks for their owners/fleets. Run on Less trucks achieved an average fuel economy that is 66% higher than the national average for new trucks. With this level of improvement, a new tractor truck could save almost double the $150,000 purchase cost in its lifetime.  
Integration of engine, tractor, and trailer is key. The high fuel efficiency achieved by the roadshow participants came from the combination of engine, transmission, aerodynamic and tire technologies, and their integration. Aerodynamic drag, the biggest factor in fuel consumption for tractor trucks at highway speeds, was reduced by the addition of skirts, tails, and gap reducers (figure 1) and optimal pairings of tractor and trailer. Trailers contributed substantially to achieving these double-digit fuel economy values, confirming that EPA and DOT got it right when they brought trailers under the Phase 2 standards.

  Run on Less showcased very high fuel efficiency under realistic loading profiles and road grades, using expert drivers and some of today’s best technology. Trucking fleets will be inspired to explore these and other new technologies, adopt the best practices of these drivers, and set new fuel economy targets for their operations. The grand success of Run on Less demonstrates that fleets investing in fuel-efficiency technologies will save a lot of fuel — and money.

ACEEE State Energy Efficiency Scorecard: ID, FL, VA Three Most-Improved States, MA Still #1;"Washington, DC—As more states struggle with extreme weather events, the 2017 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard gives state-level policymakers a road map for building stronger and more-resilient communities. This 11th annual report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), released today, shows which states are doing the best on energy efficiency — a critical tool for withstanding and recovering from storms and economic shocks. To download the State Energy Efficiency Scorecard online, go to http://aceee.org/state-policy/scorecard.
Idaho, Florida, and Virginia are the three most-improved states in the newly released report. Massachusetts broke its 2016 tie with California by holding on to the No. 1 ranking, while the Golden State slipped to No. 2. As national leaders, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Oregon round out the top five in the ACEEE Scorecard. Idaho posted the most gains by far in 2017, surging past a number of mid-ranked states in ACEEE’s comparative index of efficiency policies, best practices, and other metrics. Idaho advanced seven spots, from 33rd to 26th place. The balance of the 10 most-improved states are Virginia, Oklahoma, Florida, Utah, Nevada, Louisiana, Oregon, Washington, D.C., and Kentucky. While they show promise, all states can improve. 
Storm-hit Florida and Texas rose in the rankings. Florida is among the top 10 most-improved states for energy efficiency. In late 2016 the state began its new Farm Renewable and Efficiency Demonstration (FRED) Program, which provides free energy evaluations to farmers and grant reimbursements for proposed efficiency measures. In addition, Florida is preparing to implement a stronger state building code with a major emphasis on energy efficiency. Both Florida (jumping three spots on the Scorecard to rank #22) and Texas (improving to #26) can continue to place greater emphasis on energy efficiency policy and implementation as they rebuild in the wake of the recent hurricanes. 
“States hit by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma will need to rebuild, and energy efficiency can help them do so smartly, including improved building codes and promotion of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems,” said Steven Nadel, executive director, ACEEE. “By pursuing energy efficiency policies, states can save residents and businesses billions in the long term. There is a lot of overall movement in the 2017 Scorecard. Some states that have gone for years without much change have made incredible strides.”
Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, said: “As Massachusetts continues to make historic investments and progress in clean energy development, energy efficiency remains the most cost-effective method of reducing ratepayer costs and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Massachusetts is proud to lead the nation in energy efficiency policies and programs, and over the last year our administration has focused on increasing access for low- and moderate-income ratepayers, while investing in innovative peak demand reduction projects that will provide significant environmental and economic benefits to the Commonwealth.”
Terry McAuliffe, governor of Virginia said: “I am encouraged that ACEEE continues to recognize the excellent work we are doing in the Commonwealth to advance energy efficiency through innovative programs such as the VASaves Green Communities Program and Energy Performance Contracting for public agencies. While we have made progress in these areas, there is still much to be done to grow utility-sponsored programs and encourage strategies like Combined Heat and Power. Energy efficiency is a win-win for Virginia’s economy and our environment, and we must build on the momentum generated over the last four years.”
Gina Raimondo, governor of Rhode Island, said: “From the nation’s first offshore wind farm to the thousands of clean energy jobs we’ve created over the past few years, I’m proud that Rhode Island is leading the nation in the green economy. These programs help all of us — including residents, businesses, cities, towns and State government — to save money on our energy bills, reduce our carbon footprint and add to the 15,000 clean energy jobs in our economy. Rhode Island’s third place ranking in this report, up from fourth last year, demonstrates that our investments in electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs are paying off.”
Butch Otter, governor of Idaho, said: “Idaho is committed to using energy and all our precious resources in the most efficient way possible. The ACEEE report shows that we’re making real progress in capturing cost-effective energy efficiencies, which helps reduce power bills for ratepayers and the need for more costly and less sustainable forms of energy generation.”
OTHER KEY FINDINGS
California, Massachusetts, and New York continue to lead the way in energy-efficient transportation policies for the second consecutive year. California’s requirements for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have prompted several strategies for smart growth. Massachusetts promoted smart growth development in cities and municipalities through state-delivered financial incentives. New York, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont are among the few states in the nation to have a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reduction target.
No. 3 Rhode Island achieved a perfect 20-out-of-20 score in the utility programs category for the fourth year in a row, thanks again to its ambitious Three-Year Energy Efficiency Procurement Plan, which has helped to drive electric utility savings to levels approaching 3%, among the highest in the country. In December 2016, the Governor’s Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4) issued the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan to help cut emissions 45% by 2035 under the Resilient Rhode Island Act.
Vermont and Oregon ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, both posting increases to their nation-leading levels of electricity savings and showing strong performances across nearly every policy area. In the top 10 again this year were Connecticut, New York, Washington, Minnesota, and Maryland. Each of these states has well-established efficiency programs and continues to push the boundaries by redefining the ways in which policies and regulations can enable energy savings.
Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Vermont were the leading states in utility-sector energy efficiency programs and policies. These three states also topped this category in 2014, 2015, and 2016. With records of success, all three continued to raise the bar on cost-effective programs and policies.
California continued to lead in efficient buildings policies, with its latest building energy code updates taking effect in January 2017 and moving the state closer to its goal of achieving net zero energy use for all new residential buildings by 2020 and commercial buildings by 2030. Other leaders include the District of Columbia, New York, and Washington, all of which have adopted the latest model codes and enforce mandatory building energy benchmarking and transparency policies for the commercial or residential building sector.
Multiple states in the lower tiers also showed progress. Louisiana moved up three spots to 44th, with savings continuing to increase as its utilities transition from the three-year “quick start” phase of their energy efficiency programs to the more comprehensive second phase. Mississippi, which also kicked off quick-start programs in 2014, held proceedings to guide the evolution to full-scale portfolios this year as well.
METHODOLOGY
The 2017 Scorecard assesses state policies and programs that improve energy efficiency in our homes, businesses, industries, and transportation systems. It examines the six policy areas in which states typically pursue energy efficiency: utility and public benefits programs and policies; transportation policies; building energy codes and compliance; Combined Heat and Power policies; state government-led energy efficiency initiatives; and appliance and equipment standards.
An update to the Scorecard report methodology in 2017 gives new consideration to state policies designed to improve energy efficiency programs that serve low-income customers. This new scoring metric arises from ACEEE research that shows low-income US households spend three times as much on their household energy bills as a percentage of their income as other households.

Help us save watts and drops by taking our new survey;"Energy and water resources have long been recognized as interdependent, but policymakers have rarely addressed their interaction in any formal way. The energy-water nexus has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners.  Their goal is to better understand how water is used to produce energy and generate electricity; how energy is used to move, heat, and treat water; and how policies can successfully address the technical challenges of efficiently managing these resources together.
Since 2005 ACEEE has been engaging leaders in the energy-water field to raise awareness of the energy intensity of water and wastewater services and the research opportunities for strengthening coordination between energy and water programs. Past research has demonstrated that closer coordination has the potential to unlock new levels of energy savings through saving water, and vice versa. This fall, ACEEE is examining new and existing efforts by utilities and program administrators to implement programs that address water and energy together. We are requesting your participation in a brief survey to learn more about current water-energy utility programs in your area.
Past research on exemplary programs and new efforts
We have collaborated with the Alliance for Water Efficiency to highlight exemplary programs that promote collaboration among energy and water utilities to improve efficiency.  Our research identified a limited but promising patchwork of these programs that included innovative energy performance contract design in Boulder, Colorado, synergistic water-energy sustainability efforts in Massachusetts, and crosscutting water and energy incentive programs for multifamily buildings in Austin, Texas. The analysis also identified a variety of challenges and areas for additional research. However opportunities remain to identify best practices for successful collaboration among water, electric, and natural gas utilities. And embedded energy savings from water efficiency still needs to be identified and measured to reach savings goals.
In an update to our 2013 research, we are revisiting these challenges and confronting them head-on. We will conduct an analysis of recent trends in this rapidly emerging field. Our research will document successful policy examples, best practices, and lessons learned by energy utilities designing programs. We will also look at evaluation methodologies that track both energy and water savings. We will focus on utility-led energy efficiency programs, the types of policies and guidance currently driving leading efforts, and the factors influencing their success.
Help us by taking our survey
Are you running a program focused on both energy usage and water? Do you know of a great example? Please take our survey to help us highlight electric or natural gas utility efficiency programs in your area that track energy and water savings achieved from energy efficiency programs, including programs administered jointly between energy and water utilities. Your feedback will help us better understand recent advances and opportunities in the field and highlight achievements and best practices from successful programs.
Please submit your survey response by Monday, October 16 with any information or feedback you might have or feel free to reach out to me directly at wberg@aceee.org. We look forward to hearing from you!

Multifamily benchmarking can save energy — with the right support;"Many cities have started benchmarking initiatives to reduce citywide energy consumption. This could be good news for people living in apartments and condominiums, because many are renters and low-income residents who would benefit from lower energy bills. Low-income families can struggle to find affordable and energy-efficient homes. The apartments they rent are often in need of repairs, have older appliances, and operate with less-efficient heating and cooling equipment, which partly explains their higher energy bills. On average, low-income multifamily residents spend 5% of their income on utility bills, which is more than triple what other households spend. Improving the energy efficiency of multifamily buildings can be an effective strategy for reducing these high energy burdens.
We’re beginning to see exactly how benchmarking initiatives can improve the energy efficiency of multifamily properties. Benchmarking provides building owners and tenants with information on how their buildings’ energy consumption compares to that of similar buildings. This knowledge allows owners to identify and prioritize potential investments in energy-saving equipment and operational changes. Our new local policy toolkit item, Benefits of Benchmarking Initiatives in the Multifamily Market, reviews the existing research on how these initiatives can facilitate energy efficiency investments.
City-led initiatives to support benchmarking
Several trends are contributing to the uptick in benchmarking of multifamily properties. Voluntary programs are widespread, but an increasing number of cities are requiring benchmarking. Eighteen cities now require owners of multifamily buildings to benchmark their energy use. With mandatory ordinances, cities require owners to benchmark their buildings and make the results accessible to the public. Online portals, such as the one hosted by Elevate Energy in Chicago, allow the public to easily compare the energy performance of large buildings. 
When adopting mandatory ordinances or voluntary initiatives, cities must engage many community stakeholders and address the availability of whole-building energy use data for multifamily owners. Property owners need access to these data to participate in benchmarking, but many utility companies do not currently provide this information. It can be difficult and time consuming for owners to collect energy data for an entire building without utility support because they must secure each tenant’s authorization to access his or her energy data.
Fortunately, several utilities are addressing this concern and adopting standard practices for providing anonymized aggregate tenant data to building owners. Here are the paths that three cities have taken in working with utilities to make these data available:
Timeline sources: Philly | Salt Lake City | Washington, DC
Energy efficiency outcomes
Increasing evidence suggests that benchmarking can lead to substantial energy and cost savings within multifamily buildings. A recent national study of more than 50,000 multifamily buildings found that benchmarking and support services could save 4% of energy and water use in a building after one year. Those that pursue a retrofit can save double that amount.
While benchmarking increases owners’ or managers’ awareness of their building’s energy use, this increased awareness does not necessarily lead to energy savings. Cities, utilities, and community organizations must provide additional support to reduce the energy waste of apartments and condos. In addition to helping owners collect and report detailed whole-building energy data, our research has found that the most effective benchmarking initiatives provide:
Full-time staff to help owners understand and use their energy data
Low- or no-cost energy audits to identify potential efficiency upgrades
Assistance with securing financing or other forms of funding for retrofits
Kansas City’s Clean Energy Resource Center provides an example of how city stakeholders can collaborate to provide such support. The community’s two major local utilities – Kansas City Power and Light and Laclede Gas – fund the work of the center with space and staff provided by area nonprofits. Center staff offer one-on-one training for building operators, commission building energy audits, identify financing for retrofit projects, and verify projects’ energy savings. While these no-cost services are helpful for the entire multifamily sector, they are especially critical for affordable multifamily properties that want to reduce energy use but have limited funding for efficiency projects.
Resources for cities
The growing number of cities facilitating the tracking and transparency of energy data in multifamily buildings can serve as models for other cities. In addition to the examples in our new toolkit, ACEEE recently highlighted several cities with multifamily benchmarking initiatives in our 2017 Energy Efficiency Scorecard. As more cities implement community-wide energy-savings and climate goals, they should view benchmarking as a low-cost strategy for engaging multifamily building owners in achieving community-wide energy-savings and climate goals.

Cool tech tools can conserve energy in surprising ways. Explore with us.;"The extreme weather events sweeping the United States, from wildfires in the West to hurricanes in the South, are causing untold personal suffering and damaging US infrastructure. We want to help residents and businesses get back on their feet, and we see a smart use of energy as integral for long-term recovery.
Here’s why: These events can disrupt energy production and distribution, spiking prices and making it costlier for businesses to rebuild. Hurricane Harvey, for example, temporarily shuttered oil and gas refineries in Texas, a hub of fossil fuel production. We’ll need to do better with existing resources. An energy-efficient community is more resilient, less affected by supply swings, and more financially able to invest in recovery.
The good news is that technology is spurring innovative ways to do more with less. We’d like to share some of what we’re learning.
On Tuesday, Sept. 19, ACEEE is hosting three half-day “tutorial” workshops at VERGE, the premier US conference where technology meets sustainability. We have an amazing lineup of speakers who are leaders in government, business, academia, and utilities.
We’re exploring how smart devices, sensors, real-time data, and data analytics can help save energy—something ACEEE has dubbed “intelligent efficiency.” These tools can put fewer demands on US energy production and make better use of the nation’s power grid, power plants, utilities, roads, buildings, and other infrastructure.
Consider, for example, smart meters, learning thermostats such as Nest, or connected appliances such as Wi-Fi-enabled refrigerators. New software enables smoother integration of these devices so they can automatically adjust to changes in temperature, power prices, or energy demand.
In the “Yes, You Can!” workshop, business leaders will discuss the latest data analytic techniques for mining information from smart devices, as well as ways to target, track, and measure energy use.
Our “Smart Logistics” workshop will explore how the latest energy-saving tech tools can reduce emissions, in a time of rising freight volumes and demand, for quicker delivery. These tools allow shippers to share networks, consolidate loads, and assign route/mode in real time. We’ll get updates from leading shippers and fleets, including Walmart and Home Depot. An MIT expert will discuss how companies can reduce emissions through high-resolution, fuel-based routing.
The “Understanding People” workshop will focus on customer behavior and engagement. It’ll look at how better data and new tracking tools give businesses a clearer view of the energy-efficient products or services their customers will use. We’ll hear case studies of successful partnerships with startups like ecobee, which has granular data on building conditions, and Enervee, which tracks consumer shopping habits, as well as established businesses such as Sears. Federal and state officials will discuss effective public policies.
As US communities rebuild, we hope you’ll join us in exploring energy-efficient, resilient solutions. Our best wishes go to those families and businesses struggling to recover from the recent and ongoing extreme weather events.

The second Energy Efficiency Day is fast approaching. Here’s what you can do.;"Looking to get involved in the second annual Energy Efficiency Day on October 5th? Last year’s first-ever national event was a big success, and we welcome your help in expanding the reach of this year’s event.
Energy Efficiency Day is a collaborative effort of regional and national organizations that promote energy efficiency. More than 175 government agencies, companies, utilities, cities, and other organizations were official supporters in 2016. This year we are amplifying our efforts with a website, a Facebook account, more official declarations, and a challenge to save energy in homes and businesses.
Here are four ways you and your organization can spread the word about the benefits of energy efficiency.
Visit our new website and sign up. You can sign up as an individual or as an organization. As we get closer to EE Day, we’ll send you more ideas on how to get involved, including fun facts to share on social media.
Take the Lightbulb Challenge or the Office Lighting Challenge. By taking the challenge, you agree to replace at least one light bulb with an LED. If each US household purchases just one LED bulb, consumers could save $500 million annually. Share your experience with friends and colleagues.
Encourage mayors/governors to officially proclaim October 5 Energy Efficiency Day. In 2016, Hawaii Governor David Ige did so, and this year Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto has already followed suit. Check the link above for a sample proclamation that you can share with your mayor and governor.
Create and share your own content. You can share the news about Energy Efficiency Day and the benefits of saving energy—and money—through blog posts, emails, newsletters, and social media. Tell your own energy efficiency success story with videos, photos, graphics, or other content. Or share this blog post. When you sign up on the EE Day website, we will send material you can use.
Last year, EE Day participants generated more than 5,000 social media posts that were seen by millions of viewers. We were blown away by the creativity and humor of the 2016 posts, and can’t wait to see what everyone comes up with next month. We believe we can make an even bigger impact this year with your help. Send any questions to me at pkiker@aceee.org.

New and improved self-scoring tool can help cities reduce their energy use and carbon emissions;"The federal government’s plan to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord galvanized many cities. Within hours of the announcement, 369 mayors signed on to the Mayors National Climate Action Agenda, which aims to uphold the US commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) under the Paris Agreement. So, what comes next for these cities? What strategies will they use to meet their commitments, and what role will energy efficiency play?
Energy efficiency can be a significant component of city plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is a cost-effective GHG reduction strategy, saving cities money while creating healthier communities. Today’s release of our updated Local Energy Efficiency Self-Scoring Tool provides cities of every size a resource to help them develop policy roadmaps to increase energy efficiency and reduce GHGs in the process.
Using energy efficiency to reduce emissions                                   
Energy efficiency policies, programs, and technologies reduced annual carbon dioxide emissions by 490 million tons in 2015, an amount equivalent to the annual emissions from 129 coal-fired power plants. This reduction cost, at most, one-half of other resources such as wind, natural gas, and solar. Energy efficiency a cost-effective strategy for reducing emissions and can also stimulate local economic growth. About 1.9 million (full- and part-time) people were employed in the energy efficiency sector in 2015, almost ten times as many as the oil and gas industries.
Many cities already see energy efficiency as a core strategy to reduce emissions. Chicago recently announced that more energy-efficient buildings played a role in reducing community-wide GHG emissions by 7% within a five-year span. In New York City, 3,000 large buildings that were benchmarked consistently from 2010 to 2013 used six percent less energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by eight percent fewer. Some cities such as Pittsburgh are even calling out efficiency in their GHG reduction commitments in response to the Paris Agreement. The city recently reaffirmed one of its 2030 objectives to reduce energy consumption citywide through several energy efficiency initiatives.
Cities of all sizes can use the self-scoring tool to chart a path for efficiency
Cities are often leaders of innovation, and all communities, large and small, have the potential to lead. We have seen this in our 2017 City Scorecard, which evaluates large cities on their energy efficiency efforts. The scorecard helps us recognize leaders and helps cities identify opportunities to increase their efficiency. But we have also seen that innovation and leadership are not limited to large cities.  
So today we’re giving all localities opportunities to evaluate their progress and determine next steps to increase their efficiency with the updated Local Energy Efficiency Self-Scoring Tool.
Scoring your community
Communities get their scores by answering multiple choice questions about energy efficiency efforts in local government operations, community-wide initiatives, buildings policies, energy and water utility policies, and transportation policies. Does your community have an energy savings goal or GHG reductions goal? How about a building energy benchmarking initiative? Answer all the questions, and your community gets an overall score, just like the cities in the Scorecard.
After completing the tool, your community can compare itself to the median score of the 51 cities evaluated in the City Scorecard to see where it stands. We have also embedded Arlington County’s and Oakland’s self-scoring tool results in the user guide, along with a discussion about their highlights for further comparison. If that’s not enough, you could work with and encourage other small-to-large cities in your state to complete the tool, which would provide you with a better apples-to-apples comparison and possibly, the beginning of a rivalry.
Submitting your results
If you score your community, we encourage you to return the results to us by sending the completed Self-Scoring Tool to cityscorecard@aceee.org. We will verify the data (time and resources permitting), and may even include policy information and scores for your community in the State and Local Policy Database. The database showcases the energy efficiency program and policy information for over 60 local jurisdictions.
As cities re-commit to GHG reductions, this tool can help communities of all sizes institutionalize energy efficiency into their efforts and chart a path forward.

Run on Less roadshow takes a national tour to showcase the next level of tractor-trailer fuel efficiency;"In September, seven Class 8 tractor-trailers equipped with recent-model-year Freightliner, International, and Volvo trucks will participate in the first Run on Less roadshow to showcase fuel efficiency technologies. Organized by the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE) and Carbon War Room, the event will demonstrate how today’s tractors-trailers use new technologies to achieve best-in-class fuel economy. These tractor-trailers will run their actual cross-country routes, report fuel savings and carbon emissions reductions in real time, and converge in Atlanta on September 24th at the North American Commercial Vehicle Show. Top drivers will represent diverse trucking fleets, hauling heavy loads through varying terrain across the country.
Tractor-trailers consumed 1.9 million barrels of oil per day in 2016, about two-thirds of all heavy-truck fuel used. While they represent a relatively small percentage of US vehicles, they drive well over 100,000 miles annually in their first few years on the road and have high fuel consumption per mile. Thanks to the recently-adopted federal fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards, tractor-trailer fuel economy will improve by 40% in 2027 from its current average of 6 miles per gallon. This improvement will come from technological advances in engines, transmissions, aerodynamics, tires, and trailers.
Run on Less has set a goal of 9 or more miles a gallon for participants—one-and-one-half times today’s average new tractor-trailer fuel economy, and higher than the standards for Class 8 tractor-trailers in the model year 2027. What’s more, these tractor-trailers will be running in real-world driving conditions, making their ability to outperform the standards even more impressive.
The fuel efficiency feats of Run on Less tractor-trailers will point the way toward even greater heights. DOE’s SuperTruck program, a major public-private truck technology innovation partnership, gives us a preview of emerging efficiency technologies on track-tested tractor-trailers. The Cummins-Peterbilt SuperTruck, for example, achieved almost 11 miles per gallon, while Daimler’s SuperTruck demonstrated a whopping 12 miles per gallon in on-road vehicle testing over a 312-mile round trip.
Demonstrating the real-world use of today’s best tractor-trailer technologies is key to accelerating their adoption, especially in smaller fleets. Run on Less will showcase fuel efficiency under various loading profiles and road grades, and with various drivers. It will help promote advanced truck technologies that can go a long way toward improving on-road tractor-trailer fuel efficiency.

How can we increase energy efficiency investments? Here are 10 suggestions;"This is the final post in a three-part series on understanding and increasing investments in energy efficiency by businesses and individuals. In the first post, we estimated these US investments total about $60-115 billion per year. In the second post, we discussed what motivates many households and businesses to invest in energy efficiency. This post builds on the first two and discusses approaches that could increase such investments in the future.
No more than one-fourth of households and businesses, on average, adopt efficiency measures (see the second post). If this number seems surprisingly small to you, we agree. These upgrades save money, improve health, and increase productivity, so why aren’t investment levels much higher?
Based on her surveys, Suzanne Shelton suggests there are four key reasons: (1) most people prefer to spend money on aesthetics; (2) homes and buildings are meeting expectations (e.g., 79% of business decision-makers and 47% of homeowners think they are already efficient); (3) some efficiency home improvements don’t save money (e.g., payback periods may be long or non-existent); and (4) even if they care about the environment, they are not prioritizing homes and buildings, even though homes and buildings often have the largest impact on their energy use.
Other factors may explain why businesses don’t invent in efficiency. Based on several years of interactions with hundreds of public- and private-sector partners, Maria Vargas, the director of DOE’s Better Buildings Challenge, suggested to us five important reasons: (1) more efficient technology is seen as expensive, riskier, and harder to maintain and operate; (2) facility managers and building operators don’t have time to implement energy efficiency strategies or are short-staffed and without a team of experts to help; (3) there are challenges getting senior leadership on board; (4) information on building energy performance is either non-existent or hard to access; and (5) a lack of financing and/or up-front capital makes it difficult to make long-term investments.
How do we address these challenges? On the one hand, annual efficiency investments of $60-115 billion are nothing to sneeze at. We’re doing some things right and can — and should — build on what is working. On the other hand, to reach people and businesses not embracing efficiency, we also need to try new approaches. Here are 10 suggestions to increase investments in those two categories.
Doing What We’ve Been Doing but Better and Deeper
1) Work with customers with a predilection to make efficiency investments
Some customers, such as large businesses and the well-to-do, are investing more in efficiency than others. We can work from our core by encouraging these customers to do more while also working on adjoining groups of customers such as medium-sized businesses and middle-income consumers.
2) Document and promote the non-energy benefits of energy efficiency
Financial messages can be a double-edged sword (see second post), and we should not overly emphasize them. Health, comfort, worker and factory productivity, and environmental protection can be important as motivating factors. These benefits should be better documented and promoted more, often breaking them down into specifics that people care about, such as less-drafty homes or reduced worker sick days.
3) Improve motivational tools and marketing
Benchmarking performance, such as for large buildings (as many cities are doing) and individual households (as many utilities are doing) helps owners with below-average performance identify themselves and can motivate improvement. Just like people use Fitbits to count their daily steps and get in shape, building operators can keep track of their buildings’ performance and improve their buildings’ fitness. More cities should take action and extend benchmarking to smaller buildings, including homes.
Many purchase decisions are made from the heart, not the brain. Making links to things people care about, such as their kids and communities, telling stories people can relate to, and highlighting social norms (“good citizens are doing it”) can all help. For example, Graziano and Gillingham have documented the influence of neighbors in the spread of solar photovoltaic system adoption, and Noonan, Hsieh, and Matisoff have shown how the adoption of zoned HVAC systems spread among neighbors “like a contagion.” We can do the same for other energy efficiency investments, as the City of Takoma Park, Maryland, is trying to do by placing signs that recognize sustainability champions (see photo).
4) Expand availability of easy-to-use and affordable financing
A common barrier to investment is upfront costs, and financing can help. A variety of easy-to-use financing strategies, such as on-bill financing (OBF) and property-assessed clean energy (PACE) financing, are gaining currency in a few areas but should be expanded substantially. OBF includes a variety called Pay As You Save (PAYS), which has been particularly popular with rural electric co-ops. Another creative solution used by some large customers is internal revolving funds, in which capital is provided or raised for an initial project, and the money saved is put into a revolving fund to finance additional energy-saving projects (for example, this approach has been successfully used by the Spectrum Healthcare Sustainability Fund). And yet another creative option is to combine solar and energy efficiency financing as PosiGen is now doing in Connecticut and Louisiana for moderate-income households.
5) Continue and expand policies that are proven to work
Building codes, appliance and vehicle efficiency standards, utility-sector efficiency programs, ENERGY STAR®, and energy saving performance contracts are all effective energy savers. These policies should be continued and expanded in regions of the country such as the Southeast and the Great Plains that presently have only limited efforts.
Trying New Approaches
To reach people and businesses not embracing efficiency, we also need to try new approaches. For example, smaller businesses and moderate-income households are less likely to make efficiency investments and may particularly benefit from new approaches (see second post). There is also growing interest among efficiency practitioners in various energy efficiency services that have the potential to reach new customers.
6) Provide new services
Most small businesses and households have limited time and expertise to think about energy efficiency. The same applies to many larger customers. For these customers, simple services provided by someone else would be useful – all the customer needs to do is say “yes.” For example, PG&E is experimenting with pay-for-performance weatherization, whereby the utility will reimburse contractors based on the energy savings they achieve. A start-up, Forgitit, is offering residential energy monitoring services for $30 per year, including rate monitoring, usage monitoring, energy efficiency monitoring, real-time billing monitoring, and automatic rate-switching when rates change. In Europe, Energiesprong has developed approaches for mass retrofits to public and other types of multifamily housing; NYSERDA is working with Energiesprong to bring the approach to the US.
For commercial users, firms such as Agilis Energy, AtSite, Energy Savvy, and FirstFuel offer energy use analysis, remote monitoring, and troubleshooting services. A field study on three buildings that were already ENERGY STAR® certified found 13% average energy savings for one of these services, achieving performance substantially beyond the qualifying levels for the ENERGY STAR® Buildings Program. Also, there are new private-sector start-ups that are offering financing and other services for small and medium-sized commercial customers, such as Joule Assets, Lime Energy, Noesis, and SparkFund. Going a step further, the German government is offering funding for new “smart” energy monitoring and savings systems provided to customers in the residential, commercial, or industrial sectors. The goal is to create systems that measure actual savings using metered data. A few ventures have been funded, but it is too early to say how they are doing.
7) Take advantage of home and building purchases and refinancing
Recent home purchasers and households with children are more likely to make home improvements (see second post). Energy efficiency services can be specifically targeted to them. Another opportunity is to offer efficiency upgrades to households during major events, such as moving to a new home or refinancing a mortgage. Refinancing happens roughly every decade for many commercial buildings. The New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation, for example, has had some success with this approach. Perhaps the same could be done with residential refinancing, although such loans may move too quickly to add an efficiency package. Another interesting idea is being tried in Belgium, France, and Germany, where homeowners are given a comprehensive energy audit. The data are used to develop a multi-year renovation plan that can be gradually implemented. Online “passports” are being set up to store information, so it is easy for homeowners and their contractors to take the next step.
8) Encourage continuous improvement
For large industrial and commercial energy users, the International Standards Organization (ISO) 50001 process has been established to encourage firms to make investments in ongoing programs that manage their energy use, including making commitments to continuous improvement. The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) 50001 Ready initiative has resources to assist. Going a step further, several governments in Europe have given firms tax reductions for implementing energy management programs (see here and here). As a result, as of 2015, there were nearly 6,000 ISO 50001-certified firms in Germany, compared to about 50 in the United States.
9) Work upstream
Instead of working home by home and building by building, sometimes it is possible to work with manufacturers and trade associations to serve many customers at once. For example, DOE offered the Rooftop Challenge to spur manufacturers to develop and market improved-efficiency rooftop air conditioners. Several manufacturers developed products. DOE also worked with large purchasers such as Target to make substantial purchases. In the past, similar efforts have focused on residential refrigerators and clothes washers. Likewise, in Europe, several countries have entered into voluntary agreements with industrial trade associations. The associations, on behalf of their members, agree to undertake various energy management actions to meet specified improvement targets, with the governments providing assistance of various sorts.
10) Increase local leadership and community action
While past US efficiency efforts have often been at the utility or state levels, there is great potential to do much more at the local level, where many people and businesses have a strong connection. For example, ACEEE prepares a biennial City Energy Efficiency Scorecard to look at large US cities. Boston has perennially ranked first and features efforts such as the Renew Boston program and building energy benchmarking and transparency requirements. But smaller communities can also do a lot. Notable examples include Charlottesville, VA, which offers a special tax rate for select energy-efficient residential and commercial buildings, and Hood River, OR, Marshfield, MA, and Bainbridge, WA, where energy retrofits have been intensely marketed as part of a community-wide initiative, achieving much higher participation rates than normal in the process.
Conclusions
US businesses and households are investing roughly $60-115 billion in energy efficiency each year. These investments were 8-9% higher in 2016 than in 2015 (see first post). To continue and accelerate this growth, we need to continue doing what we’ve been doing (but better and deeper), and also try new approaches such as encouraging new service offerings. This post provides some starting points, but we encourage additional creative ideas. Please comment on this blog and share your ideas with us.

Here’s how Southeastern states can reduce the energy burden of low-income households;"Southeastern residents currently face historically high poverty rates, and low-income households spend an average of three times as much on energy bills, as a portion of their monthly income, than other families. Energy efficiency investments could help lower energy bills, but low-income residents in the region often lack access to energy-saving upgrades.
In two recent surveys of large electric utilities, ACEEE found that most utilities in the Southeast spend less on targeted low-income efficiency programs per residential customer and see fewer savings than those in other parts of the country. This lack of investments means that Important economic development and poverty reduction strategies are underutilized. But it’s not too late. States can help their low-income residents get a leg up by emphasizing smart programs and policies crafted for them. Our new series of Southeastern state fact sheets shows how.
Steps for serving low-income households in the Southeast
Our new fact sheets use ACEEE and Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance data to offer a quick overview of current utility low-income energy efficiency efforts. We also provide strategies that states can use to scale up resources for this population. Our research shows that utilities, regulators, and policymakers in Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia have many options to reduce the energy burden of low-income households.
State legislatures and public service commissions can enact policies to encourage or require efficiency investments in these communities. They can also revisit cost-effectiveness tests and exempt low-income programs (as many Southeastern states already do) or capture the numerous non-energy benefits, such as improved participant health, that these programs deliver. Southeastern utilities, in turn, can offer programs that address both electricity and gas usage (as Georgia Power does) and design programs to reach both owners and renters. Also, utilities, state officials, advocates, and members of the low-income housing community can form stakeholder working groups to continuously reevaluate the best opportunities for serving these populations (for example, Tennessee’s Energy Efficiency Information Exchange). By taking these steps, states can bolster local economies and alleviate energy poverty.
Looking forward
ACEEE will continue to explore best practices for cities, states, and utilities to increase efficiency investments and improve program delivery to low-income households. From our recent baseline assessment, we will dive deeper into low-income program best practices, as well as rural energy burdens and efficiency opportunities. ACEEE is available to help state and local partners deepen energy savings for this underserved population. If you would like to know how we can help, please contact me at mshoemaker@aceee.org.

Energy efficiency and industry: the national trend;"The industrial sector is unique among end-use sectors in that its energy intensity has declined consistently in recent decades, decreasing 45% from 1977 through 2016. The decline occurred even though the sector’s energy use has fluctuated, its output has almost doubled, and economic activity has risen and fallen with economic cycles.
This trend is promising because the industrial sector accounted for slightly more than 30% of the US gross domestic product in 2016. The sector also comprises dozens of individual industries spanning agriculture, forestry, fisheries, construction, mining, and manufacturing.
Industrial energy consumption, value of shipments, and energy intensity, 1977–2016
Source: ACEEE analysis based on various EIA sources
The graph represents a composite of these industries. (Graphing data for individual industries is impractical because of shifting definitions, numbers, diversity, and business cycles.) For the industrial sector as a whole, an inverse relationship exists between intensity and value of shipments. When utilization of capacity increases, intensity decreases. (“Value of shipments” measures the economic value of all products shipped from industrial plants in an industry.)
Some of this change results from structural shifts in the industrial sector, but much of it can be attributed to technology and practice improvements in energy-intensive industries, which account for more than four-fifths of the sector’s energy use. For example, the steel industry has made major modernization investments that resulted in a 28% reduction in Btus per ton of steel produced between 1990 and 2004. A large factor in this improvement has been a shift toward more reliance on secondary steel (recycled steel) and less reliance on primary steel (from iron ore through a reduction process). Importantly, this shift from primary to secondary product was enabled by the development of technology that allows the use of scrap to produce high-strength steel alloys.
Also contributing to reduced industrial energy use are system approaches, such as combined heat and power (CHP). CHP is an energy-efficient method of generating both electricity and useful thermal energy in a single, integrated system that is used in many energy intensive industries. A CHP system saves energy by recovering heat from power-only generation that would otherwise be wasted and using it to satisfy on-site thermal energy needs. The chemical industry has reduced energy use per unit of product by about 40% since 1980 by expanding CHP installations and modernizing process technology.
As the adoption of new techniques, such as smart manufacturing and intelligent efficiency, continues, so should industrial energy intensity’s downward trend.
ACEEE began assembling this data for a 2007 research report. It has made regular updates as new data become available.

US cities are starting to expand transportation options for low-income residents;"Many urban residents today can choose from a wide range of travel options. Public buses and trains, car-sharing options like Zipcar, on-demand ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, and bike-share programs are available in major cities. However, many of these options are not widely available in low-income neighborhoods because they can be physically inaccessible or unaffordable to their residents.
Additionally, as many cities have spread outward and the distance between jobs and residential centers has grown, fewer residents are served by affordable and efficient transportation options, and daily commutes can be long and expensive. This is particularly true in low-income neighborhoods, where transportation options are often few and far between.
New urban mobility options must serve everyone. This approach would transform how people travel and enable them to reap the benefits of saved time and fuel. Car-, bike-, and ride-sharing programs could remove the dependence on single-occupancy vehicle trips in urban communities while reducing overall energy consumption. Safe and appealing environments for walking and biking could help, too.
Cities are expanding car-sharing programs
A variety of pilot projects and programs peppered around the country are aiming to make transportation services that have typically targeted more affluent neighborhoods available to low-income communities. Most of these pilot efforts are focused on car sharing and bike sharing, but all have the same goals of changing mobility patterns, connecting underserved households to difficult-to-access job centers, and minimizing expensive commutes.
Car sharing can help improve access to job centers as well as overall mobility in low-income communities, while also removing the need to purchase and maintain personal vehicles. Car-sharing programs essentially provide a vehicle where and when needed, removing the onus of owning a vehicle. According to a report by the Urban Institute, urban, low-income households generally either don’t own cars or they drive cars that are older and pollute more on average than vehicles owned by higher-income households. The energy and emissions reduction potential from this sub-sector of vehicle owners is therefore significant. 
Many cities and states are working to make car-sharing services accessible to low-income communities. Californian cities, in particular, have taken the lead in creating and implementing these programs. As part of its Sustainable City pLAn, the City of Los Angeles created a car-sharing pilot program to bring 100 electric vehicles to some of the lowest-income communities in the city. Spurred by SB 1275 (the Charge Ahead California Initiative) and funded by the California Air Resources Board, the pilot program makes cleaner, more-efficient transportation options more easily available in low- and moderate-income communities. More recently, the city of Sacramento has provided electric vehicles for car sharing in three public housing complexes.
In Chicago, the Shared Use Mobility Center has partnered with Getaround ride sharing to create a pilot peer-to-peer car sharing network in low-income communities. In the past six months, the program has registered more than 5,000 residents who share 75 vehicles on an as-needed basis, indicating keen interest in alternatives to personal vehicle ownership among low- to medium-income households.
Bike-sharing programs are also expanding
Bike sharing gives residents in underserved communities access to fuel-free trips. Bike-sharing programs can connect low-income communities to public transit, as they offer an option for quick, on-demand, one-way trips to and from stations, boosting ridership and often saving fuel in the process.
In 2015, The JPB Foundation funded the City of Philadelphia, the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), and the PeopleForBikes Foundation to create the Better Bike Share Partnership (BBSP), aimed specifically at underserved communities. Using Philadelphia as a pilot, the BBSP funded the construction of 20 bike stations in underserved communities. PeopleForBikes will oversee more than $900,000 in Better Bike Share grant funding to increase bike sharing in underserved communities around the country. As part of the first round of funding, Better Bike Share has awarded grants to bike-share programs in Austin, Boston, Brooklyn, Charlotte, Chicago, and Washington, DC. The second year of funding covered programs in Atlanta, Basalt, CO, Boston, Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Oakland and Berkeley, and Portland, OR.
Ensuring that low-income communities have access to new, affordable, and more-efficient mobility options connects these households to key job centers and services. It also reduces the overall transportation energy cost burden on already financially strained families and improves the overall efficiency of transportation systems in urban areas. The programs described here are just a few among a growing number of efforts across the country; they illustrate how cities can better accommodate the most-underserved communities in mobility planning.

Our unique guide tracks how local energy policy boosts community resilience;"How have your community’s energy efficiency initiatives also increased its resilience? Our new paper, Indicators for Local Energy Resilience, gives municipal leaders a unique set of tools to answer this question. We explore local energy resilience, our new term for the interconnection of community resilience and various aspects of energy supply and consumption. We look at different aspects of this concept — like thermal building performance and transportation connectivity — and methods communities can use to assess them. By applying these lessons, municipalities can get a better sense of their own local energy resilience.
Tracking local energy resilience
We’ve spent the last few years drawing the connection between energy efficiency and community resilience (see here and here). In our research, we take a broad approach to the concept of community resilience by including both physical factors like energy reliability and socioeconomic ones such as the strength of the local economy. This broader concept is also used by many urban planners and local policymakers (see here, here, here, and here for examples) because community resilience is not just about keeping the lights on during a big storm. It’s also about strengthening communities by making energy affordable and reliable for all.
So how can communities track their progress toward local energy resilience? Identifying indicators to monitor progress is complex because community resilience is cross-cutting. Considering all aspects of local energy resilience and the linkages among those aspects can become a brainteaser.
Our approach
Our paper charts local energy resilience in nine discrete dimensions: energy reliability, transportation connectivity, distributed generation, thermal building performance, the urban heat island effect, climate change, particulate matter pollution, financial energy burdens, and energy bill stability. We provide indicators for each dimension so policymakers and interested stakeholders can gauge community progress toward resilience.
Take the example of energy burdens. High energy burdens are impediments to community resilience, especially those of low-income households. They reduce households’ ability to cope, making it harder to prepare for the unexpected. In the paper, we lay out these connections to resilience and provide guidance on calculating average energy burdens for the city or specific neighborhoods in need. If a community uses the guidance to better understand energy burdens, it can determine what steps may be necessary to address high burdens.
This example also shows why our indicators are unique. Unlike other indicator systems that ignore energy issues or narrowly focus on energy reliability, ours capture a broad set of physical, environmental, and socioeconomic aspects of local energy resilience.
Using the indicators
We focus on local government activities so the indicators can better inform municipalities’ resilience strategies and activities. Government officials can use the indicators to establish a local energy resilience baseline, and administrators can create programs, set goals, and develop policies to increase local energy resilience. We hope this report will help local governments to create a roadmap for a more energy resilient future.

Ultra-low energy retrofits show promising growth across the US;"The United States is seeing a promising upward trend in ultra-low energy (ULE) buildings. While much of this progress has occurred with new construction, it is beginning to spread to existing buildings. Over the past decade, a small but growing number of ULE building retrofit projects have been documented in more than 20 states.
This is great news, because a highly efficient building stock is one of the cornerstones of a prosperous clean energy economy. Today’s buildings consume roughly 40% of all energy used in the United States, and retrofits of existing buildings can produce sizable energy savings. To qualify as ULE, homes typically need to reduce energy intensity by 70-85%, while commercial buildings must do so by 60-70%.
In our new white paper, we explore retrofit progress in ULE buildings, which includes zero-energy homes and commercial buildings. We highlight initiatives and policies that are laying the groundwork for advanced retrofits that yield deeper energy savings. Some of these efforts demonstrate technical approaches for slashing energy use, establish technical guidance and energy intensity targets for ULE buildings, and certify post-retrofit energy use. Others aim to deliver deep retrofits at a larger scale.
These initiatives were developed and operate largely outside the realm of utilities and other traditional energy efficiency program administrators. Many, such as Passive House Institute US’s PHIUS+ certification, can serve as the technical basis for programs looking to expand deep retrofit activities and program investments. Others are pilots that could be adopted by programs, such as Vermont’s Zero Energy Now, which is now a part of Efficiency Vermont’s program portfolio.
Given the scale of the challenge, we will need a comprehensive set of complementary policies, programs, and initiatives, along with strategic research, to achieve a high level of ULE building performance in our existing building stock. Experience from these groundbreaking initiatives, coupled with broader lessons from building retrofit markets, provides useful insights into policy and program activity. Recommendations from the paper include the following:
Set aggressive energy savings targets at the policy, program, and project levels to create a strong impetus for action
Leverage existing policies and programs to take advantage of existing infrastructure and relationships
Establish the right requirements and carefully designed policy mandates and program rules to improve project outcomes and scale up ULEB retrofit activity
Meet customers where they are through flexible program offerings that address their needs and interests
Call on the community to help build broader and deeper commitment to retrofits
Engage occupants to ensure better retrofit outcomes and building energy performance
Do the research needed to expand available solutions for more building types
By building on these recommendations, we can drive greater demand for ULE retrofits, as well as the mechanisms for delivering them.

"New ENERGY STAR-like label enters the marketplace; Join us to learn more";"In mid August, we’re holding a pre-conference Summer Study meeting in Denver to explain and discuss something big. Really big!
We started the Extended Motor Product Label Initiative (EMPLI) three years ago to create an ENERGY STAR®-like label for commercial and industrial products: fans, pumps, and air compressors to start, and drives and maybe elevators and escalators in the future.
We’re on the cusp of making that goal a reality. We’re starting with pumps. The Hydraulic Institute and its pump manufacturing members have created a Pump Energy Rating label that gives information about a pump the same way the EnergyGuide provides energy savings on a refrigerator.
This label can help end users and, since the Hydraulic Institute developed its rating and labeling system with the input of energy efficiency program administrators, it can also become the basis of new prescriptive rebate programs. Just as savings programs provided per-horsepower rebates for high-efficiency motors in the past, new programs will be able to do the same for pumps, fans, and air compressors in the future.
There’s more. The Hydraulic Institute has created a database with information on all tested and certified products. The Northwest Regional Technical Forum has approved savings estimation methods for many of these products. We are ready to start pilot programs.
And now for the really big news: the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance is working with software developers to create an on-line marketplace where all certified products can be listed and energy efficiency programs can list the features and details of their programs. Wholesalers and project developers in the commercial and industrial sectors can see if their clients are eligible for incentives as well as apply for and receive them. The Extended Motor Product Marketplace (XMP MP) will be national in scope.
Sound interesting? Good, because we need you to help us shape the future of the XMP MP. Frankly, we can’t do it without the participation and contributions of people from across the energy efficiency sector, especially those involved in program administration, implementation, and evaluation. Our free pre-conference meeting starts at 1:00 pm on August 15; let me know if you plan to attend with an email to industry@aceee.org
Like this meeting, our Summer Study is a great chance to meet people in the industrial sector. We have plenty of time between sessions for networking and allow attendees to schedule informal sessions. We offer three other pre-conference meetings, two of which are free.
Please join us to help make the XMP Marketplace a reality. Together, we can make what’s new happen.

States Can Save Consumers and Businesses $113B with New Appliance Standards;"Washington, DC—States could save consumers and businesses $113 billion by adopting new efficiency standards for products such as computers and faucets, according to a new report, States Go First: How States Can Save Consumers Money, Reduce Energy and Water Waste, and Protect the Environment with New Appliance Standards, released today by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). The report recommends 21 appliance standards that states can adopt in the near term.
“These standards give states a great opportunity to save energy and water, lower utility bills for consumers and businesses, and reduce air pollutant emissions,” said Joanna Mauer, technical advocacy manager of ASAP and lead author of the report. “By adopting new appliance standards, states can also boost local economies and reduce strain on the electric grid.”
“With the federal government’s direction on energy and water efficiency uncertain, it’s an ideal time for states to step up,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of ASAP.  “States can have a big impact by taking leadership in this area.”
The 21 recommended standards in the report cover a wide range of energy- and water-using residential and commercial products. They include computers and monitors, commercial dishwashers, faucets, and portable air conditioners. The report estimates potential savings through 2035 assuming that the standards would take effect in 2020. On a national level, the report found that the 21 recommended standards could:
Provide $113 billion in net present value savings for consumers and businesses, taking into account both utility bill savings and estimated impacts on product costs for items sold between 2020 and 2035
Save 41 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually in 2035, or about 1.5% of current total residential and commercial annual electricity use
Save 155 trillion Btus of natural gas annually in 2035, or about 2% of current total residential and commercial annual natural gas use
Save 630 billion gallons of water annually in 2035, or about 6% of current annual residential water usage
Reduce annual CO2 emissions in 2035 by 23 MMT, which is equivalent to the annual CO2 emissions of about seven average coal-fired power plants
Other key findings include:
The top three products in terms of potential economic savings are water-using products: faucets, showerheads, and lawn spray sprinklers.
More than half of the total potential primary energy savings come from the recommended standards for faucets, high color rendering index (CRI) fluorescent lamps, and computers and monitors.
The average US household could save $106 annually on its energy and water bills from the recommended standards in 2035. The potential savings vary from $72 per average household in Iowa to $215 in Hawaii.
The US energy and water bill savings over the useful life of the 21 products outweigh the estimated additional costs by a factor of more than 7; in every state, these potential savings outweigh the costs by a factor of more than 4.
Most of the recommended standards in the report are based on standards that already exist in at least one state or ENERGY STAR® or WaterSense specifications. Three of the standards are for products for which final federal standards have been put on hold by the Trump administration.
At least 18 states have enacted appliance standards at various times. Most of today’s national standards, which cover products ranging from refrigerators to commercial air conditioners to electric motors, started out at the state level.
“State standards have not only provided benefits to states adopting standards, but have also helped spur national standards,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of ACEEE. “Even when just a small number of states adopt standards, it can be sufficient to affect national markets.”
The full report is available at: http://aceee.org/research-report/a1702
State-by-state savings estimates for each of the 21 recommended standards are available at: https://appliance-standards.org/state-savings-state-standards
ASAP (appliance-standards.org) organizes and leads a broad-based coalition effort that works to advance, win, and defend new appliance, equipment, and lighting standards that deliver large energy and water savings, monetary savings, and environmental benefits. Working together, the ASAP coalition supports new and updated standards at the national and state levels through technical and policy advocacy and through outreach and education.

Who Invests in Energy Efficiency and Why?;"This blog post is the second in a three-post series on understanding and increasing investments by businesses and individuals in energy efficiency. In the first post, we discussed current energy efficiency investments in the United States, which we estimate total about $60-115 billion per year. This number includes investments driven by policy, private market investments, and a mix of the two. In this post, we explore who invests in energy efficiency and why, focusing on mainstream businesses and consumers. The third and final post builds on the first two and discusses approaches that could increase efficiency investments in the future.
Who Invests in Energy Efficiency?
Recent research reveals notable differences in the businesses and individuals investing in energy efficiency. For example, an analysis of EIA’s Manufacturer Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) shows that larger firms have substantially higher adoption rates of energy management activities than smaller firms. (EIA will release this data in the next few months.)
Likewise, the Shelton Group found greater engagement in sustainability and conservation in certain business segments than others, illustrated in the figure below:
Percent of respondents indicating sustainability/conservation was important or very important when asked ”How important would you say sustainability and/or conservation is to your company or organization as operating, capital improvement, construction and purchasing/supply chain decisions are made?” Source: Shelton Group’s 2016 B2B Pulse survey.
Among households, those with higher incomes are more likely to make substantial energy efficiency investments (i.e., investments large enough to be eligible for federal energy efficiency tax credits). For smaller investments, such as new lightbulbs, there does not appear to be an income effect. This situation is illustrated in the figure below, developed from data in EIA’s 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey:
Frank and Nowak also found an income effect as well as an education effect among households participating in California utility rebate programs (households with higher levels of education were more likely to participate). Note that income and education are usually highly correlated. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies found, after controlling for age and income, that households that moved within the past three years spent about one-third more on home improvements than otherwise similar non-movers. In a forthcoming ACEEE report, we find more interest in making energy efficiency investments among households with children and homeowners in the 30-34 age bracket relative to younger and older households. Costanzo et al. found that more mundane factors also play an important role, such as home ownership, ownership of home technologies, and the presence of a household member able to perform household repairs.
Why Do Businesses Invest in Energy Efficiency?
Businesses that decide to make energy efficiency investments do so for many reasons, and these rationales shift over time. For example, when asked the top reasons that their organization (or client) is focused on “sustainability and/or conservation,” “energy savings and/or cost reductions” was the top response, followed by a commitment to health and wellness and consumer expectations. However, notably, in recent years the percentage of respondents citing energy and cost savings has declined, while the percentage noting concerns about climate, employee retention, and regulations has increased. These results are shown in the figure below:
Share of respondents citing each each; respondents could select more than one. Source: Shelton Group’s 2016 B2B Pulse survey.
While not included in this survey, productivity (defined broadly) can also be an important driver. Examples can be found in schools (students do better in classrooms with daylighting), offices (productivity tends to increase as temperature control, indoor air quality, and lighting control improve), and warehouses and factories (energy-saving adjustable speed drivers can reduce mass loss in apple warehouses and can speed lumber drying). In many applications, these productivity benefits can be larger (sometimes substantially larger) than the value of energy savings, as documented in some case studies.
Often, multiple rationales apply to a single investment decision, particularly for small firms. When more than 200 German manufacturing firms were asked why they invest in energy efficiency, 57% of large companies said energy efficiency was the primary reason, while 43% said that energy efficiency is a side benefit caused by other investments. For small businesses, the figures were 36% and 64%, respectively, with side benefits predominating.
Why Do Households Invest in Energy Efficiency?
Households also have multiple reasons for making efficiency investments. When asked to rank the top three reasons to “participate in energy conservation activities or buy an energy-efficient product/make home improvements,” saving money was most important, followed by comfort and health:
Top three reasons to participate in energy conservation activities or buy an energy-efficient product/make home improvements. S ource: Shelton Group 2016 Energy Pulse Survey.
Financial concerns are both a benefit of and barrier to upgrading. Some evidence (see here and here) suggests that the negative perceptions of upfront costs may outweigh the positive perception of bill savings as the dominant driver of upgrade decisions. Other financial benefits may be harder for consumers to assess. Focusing homeowners on both the financial and non-financial benefits of energy efficiency provides a complete picture of what they can expect to get back from their investment. While some home energy upgrades are not cost-effective or have long payback periods based on utility bill savings alone, they deliver other benefits that can be of great value to consumers.
For example, comfort is cited as a top reason for energy efficiency investments in many studies and has the potential to encourage more expensive investments with longer payback periods. Comfort is often underappreciated as a motivating factor because homeowners do not use that term. Instead, they talk about problems with noise, humidity, cold drafts, temperature control, natural light, glare from windows, unwanted heat from windows, and other related issues. Health and environmental sustainability motivations are also underappreciated drivers of energy efficiency investment for similar reasons.
This information provides a variety of insights into potential strategies to increase energy efficiency investments in the future. Stay tuned for our next and last blog post in this series to learn more.

Natural gas efficiency has shown impressive advances, and the future looks promising;"The majority of studies on utility-funded energy efficiency programs focus on electricity; natural gas traditionally receives much less attention. To help rectify this imbalance, today we are releasing a new report, Natural Gas Energy Efficiency: Progress and Opportunities. In this graphics-rich report, we provide a summary of natural gas efficiency efforts and accomplishments and look ahead at efficiency-related opportunities and issues.
Recent progress
Since the early 1970s, we have seen declines in residential natural gas consumption per capita, commercial consumption per employee, and industrial consumption per value of shipments. Many factors have likely contributed to this efficiency progress, such as new technologies, price effects, building codes, appliance and equipment efficiency standards, and utility-funded energy efficiency programs. Our new report discusses each of these, with a particular focus on the latter. For example, in 2015, gas utilities spent about $1.4 billion on energy efficiency programs, with savings from measures installed in 2015 amounting to approximately 0.43% of residential and commercial natural gas sales.
Some leading states and utilities are achieving incremental annual energy savings of more than 1% of residential and commercial sales each year. Impressively, they achieved total annual savings of more than 4% in 2015 (including measures installed in 2015, as well as measures installed in earlier years that were still saving energy in 2015). These programs cost the utilities on average approximately 35 cents per therm saved (a therm is 100,000 Btu of energy content, and it is the unit used to bill customers for natural gas). What sets these high-saving states apart from the rest? Most of the high-saving states have mandatory energy-savings targets for their utilities, commonly called energy efficiency resource standards. These states also frequently take steps to provide a performance incentive for utilities that achieve greater energy efficiency for their customers.
Opportunities on the horizon                
Many studies have been conducted on additional efficiency opportunities, finding that incremental annual gas savings of about 1% of sales are achievable over the next 10–20 years. These studies show that, despite the current low price of natural gas, there are still substantial, cost-effective natural gas savings available. Across the different studies, large gas-saving opportunities remain for the industrial sector, residential and commercial building retrofits, advanced controls, commercial new construction, and residential water heating.
We also discuss various other issues related to energy efficiency opportunities and the natural gas industry’s evolution in the report, such as opportunities for combined heat and power (CHP), transportation fuels, coordination with electric and water utilities, and fuel switching. In the near term, we find substantial opportunities exist for CHP deployment and coordination with other utilities. More modest opportunities exist for the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel and fuel switching.
Natural gas makes up a significant portion of our energy mix, and there are still many opportunities to increase our efficiency, keep energy bills in check, and reduce our emissions. By doing so, we can improve the US economy and environment.

How many billions do US businesses and individuals invest in energy efficiency each year?;"This is the first post in a three-part series on understanding and increasing investments in energy efficiency by businesses and individuals. The second post discusses the motivations for investment, and the third discusses approaches that could increase investment in the future.
Energy efficiency investments occur in virtually every sector of the economy. When combined, their total number is substantial — estimates range from about $60 to $115 billion a year in the United States. In this post, we look at some recent estimates of energy efficiency spending, updating and expanding information we compiled earlier this year so that we may better understand the magnitude of these investments and where they occur. These findings provide a foundation for two subsequent posts we will publish in the next month on “Who invests in energy efficiency and why?” and “How can we increase energy efficiency investments?”
IEA World Energy Investment Report
Last week, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its World Energy Investment report, covering 2016 global energy investments. IEA estimates that $231 billion was invested in energy efficiency products and services worldwide, a 9% increase from its 2015 estimate. For the first time, the agency provides an estimate of efficiency spending in just the United States: $41 billion. IEA does not provide a sector breakout for the United States, but worldwide, it estimates about 58% of these investments is in buildings, about 26% is in transportation, and 16% is in industry. While IEA includes the full cost of building envelope retrofits in its estimates, it includes only the incremental costs for high-efficiency equipment and industrial processes. For example, if a high-efficiency air conditioner costs 10% more than a conventional air conditioner, IEA counts only 10% of the total cost.
AEE Market Report
Advanced Energy Economy (AEE) publishes an annual Market Report that estimates annual revenues in “advanced energy” in the United States, including energy efficiency, advanced vehicles, renewable energy, biofuels, the electricity grid, and natural gas fueling stations. Investments in building and industrial energy efficiency and plug-in and hybrid vehicles came to $94 billion in 2016, an 8% increase relative to its 2015 report. AEE includes only specific market segments for where it has data. For example, for industrial efficiency, it includes only industrial energy management and combined heat and power systems, so some forms of efficiency investment are left out. On the other hand, for efficient equipment and vehicles, AEE includes the full cost of these products and not just the incremental cost relative to the standard products. AEE provides a detailed breakdown of these investments, which we used to prepare the pie chart below. Buildings constitute 73% of the investments, transportation 18%, and industry is only 9% due to the limited categories it included.
Source: ACEEE analysis of data in AEE 2017 Market Report.
Additional Efficiency Investments
In general, both the IEA and AEE figures include elective purchases and not investments needed to meet minimum efficiency standards and codes. Significant amounts of energy are saved by equipment efficiency standards, vehicle efficiency standards, and building codes. While IEA does include spending to implement 2012 and 2015 codes (relative to 2009 codes), according to our 2016 State Scorecard, 90% of state codes are from 2009 or earlier. To address this gap, we estimated the incremental spending on efficient equipment, vehicles, and buildings due to these policy measures, finding they total roughly $20 billion per year (details can be found here). Therefore, we estimate that the total amount of efficiency investments in the United States are on the order of $60-115 billion per year, adding $20 billion to the IEA and AEE estimates.
Other Studies
Several other studies have estimated US efficiency investments to be of a similar magnitude, including Booz Allen Hamilton ($53 billion in 2014 for green buildings) and Laitner ($72-101 billion in 2010), reinforcing the idea that $60-115 billion is a reasonable range. Still, this range is broad, and the differences among the various studies are many. Further research to refine estimates and narrow the range would be valuable.
What is driving these investments?
What is driving this $60-115 billion of efficiency investments? While some of this spending comes from decisions by businesses and households to invest in efficiency without an obvious policy influence, policy is a big driver. We estimate that building codes and appliance and vehicle standards are responsible for roughly $20 billion worth. Other programs and policies also drive substantial investment, such as utility energy programs ($7.7 billion in 2015, which leverages additional investments by customers), ENERGY STAR® and Energy Saving Performance Contracts (ESPCs) in public facilities. There is also so-called “spillover” when consumers make investments due to the indirect influence of programs and policies. Examples include purchases that occur when stores stock efficient products more widely due to programs or when architects and engineers specify efficient designs more readily for their clients. Additional information on spillover can be found here. Spillover can even be on an international scale. For example, policies in countries such as Germany and Japan influence products and practices in international markets. This said, a significant portion of the spending encouraged by policy also depends on decisions by businesses and households. We will focus on what influences business and household investment decision making in the next blog post in this series.

Don’t drop low-hanging fruit of truck fuel efficiency;"A key element of the “Phase 2” heavy-duty vehicle fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards adopted last fall was the program’s inclusion of trailers for the first time. That addition alone will deliver a cost-effective 7% improvement in tractor-trailer fuel efficiency. So it was disappointing to see the introduction of a bill in Congress (H.R.2705) to remove trailers from the program. That would be a big step backward for freight truck efficiency and would result in higher fuel costs for goods movement.
Big savings from trailer standards
Removing trailers from the Phase 2 program would mean future tractor-trailers would consume approximately 70,000 additional barrels of oil per day by 2030 and almost 100,000 barrels per day by 2040—more than the total highway fuel consumption of 17 of our 50 states in 2015. It also would unsettle a fuel efficiency program that received the support of engine and truck manufacturers, suppliers, fleets, and the environmental community. The Phase 2 heavy-duty program is projected to save 800,000 barrels of oil per day by 2040 and thereby reduce fleet operating costs, translating to consumers saving money on goods they purchase.
Tractor-trailers are responsible for two-thirds of all heavy-duty vehicle oil consumption. Getting major fuel efficiency gains from both tractors and trailers is key to an effective program, so the inclusion of trailers in Phase 2 is a crucial step forward. It would not make sense to overlook trailers—mostly boxes with few design features—while fine-tuning the engines powering the trucks that pull those trailers. Not only does trailer streamlining substantially reduce engine load, it also can permit downsizing of the tractor power train.
Trailer technologies are readily available
The standards rely on trailer advances that reduce drag through gap closing, side skirts, and undercarriage systems, along with improved tires and tire pressure monitoring. All of this equipment is readily available, thanks in part to California’s requirement that trailers be SmartWay® certified. Importantly, these technologies pay for themselves quickly; compliance cost for box trailers would be about $1,100 in 2027, which would pay back in fuel savings in less than two years and provide thousands of dollars in net savings over the 10-year life of the trailer.
Yet despite market availability and cost-effectiveness, uptake of these technologies lags. The sharing of trailers makes for a split incentive—the purchaser does not always reap the fuel savings benefit—and upfront costs may limit efficiency investments in a low-margin industry. Standards applied across the industry can help to address these barriers.     
Win-win: a flexible program that points to the future
The Phase 2 program has numerous flexibility provisions for trailer companies as a whole and for small manufacturers in particular. The standards apply to dry and refrigerated box vans and to limited types of non-box trailers, thus reducing the impacts on small businesses. The agencies also granted a one-year extension for small businesses in complying with the standards.
Looking forward, the integration of tractor and trailer is among the biggest opportunities for future efficiency gains. Industry teams in DOE’s SuperTruck program are developing aerodynamic designs that would dramatically streamline tractor-trailer pairs, reducing fuel consumption, by our estimate, an additional 23% beyond the level of the Phase 2 standards.
Eliminating trailers from the Phase 2 heavy-duty program would squelch innovation in the trailer industry and increase costs to US businesses and consumers.

Utility programs can help low-income customers keep the lights on, but some do better than others;"As households ramp up air conditioners to stay cool this summer, many will find themselves with higher energy bills. Paying these bills will be easier for some than for others. Low-income households, who spend on average three times more of their income on energy bills than other households, will undoubtedly find it more difficult to adjust to higher bills in both the summer and winter months.
Many households can address high energy burdens by taking advantage of energy efficiency programs run by their utilities. These programs provide multiple benefits beyond energy and bill savings, such as fewer shut offs, healthier homes, less outdoor pollution, and more local jobs.
To better understand the scope and reach of low-income energy efficiency programs, ACEEE completed a new baseline assessment of the electric and natural gas programs that specifically target low-income households in the largest US cities. The assessment complements previous ACEEE research that explored best practice elements for low-income utility programs. This paper examines total investments in these programs, energy savings impacts, customer participation, and utilization of best practices for more than 70 utilities’ low-income programs. The paper also includes data tables that chronicle this information for each utility.
Mapping out our findings: widespread programs but room for improvement
In this study, we looked at the largest electric and natural gas utility serving each of the 51 largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Overall, we found that nearly all MSAs in the country were served by either an electric or electric and natural gas low-income utility program, with 61% of the cities served by both an electric and natural gas low-income program, as seen in the map below. Note: these programs are in addition to those funded through the federal Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).
Low-income programs varied in terms of how deeply they address whole-home energy efficiency needs and how accessible they were to customers. Although numerous utilities incorporate best practice elements of program design—such as including appliance upgrades and health and safety measures—many can include more of these elements. We also looked at best practices in implementation, including whether programs target specific households based on energy burden or other vulnerabilities, streamline enrollment for easier access, and partner with WAP to leverage funds and reach more customers.
How to use this data
This study found that while many utilities design and administer impressive, effective low-income programs, many programs could be improved with best practice elements or increased resources. 
For example, utilities can use the data to see how their programs compare to those of similar utilities and to identify opportunities for adding best practice elements. State and local policymakers as well as other stakeholders can use the data to compare their local utility programs to programs nationally, and they can identify program elements to either include or improve in future program design and implementation.
We also added this new dataset to our ACEEE policy database, which for the first time contains information on low-income programs from our baseline assessment. The database includes new state-level information on low-income program requirements, cost-effectiveness rules, and coordination with the WAP program.

Heading to college? Shrink Your Dorm Print will help students make a statement;"An annual rite of passage is fast approaching. Parents, some wistful and others elated, will drop their kids off at college for the first time. To prepare for the big day, we’re launching the Shrink Your Dorm Print campaign.
For students who want to look good and do good, we begin with the dorm room. Our tip sheet and shopping guide will help create a room that’s truly awesome — cool, inexpensive, and eco-friendly.
Yes, students can shrink their carbon footprint and do their part to protect the planet without looking lame or busting the budget. Simple steps make it possible. Consider this: If every US college student replaced a single incandescent light bulb with an LED (light emitting diode), we could avoid the emissions of a small commercial power plant each school year.
As the federal government considers cutting back energy efficiency programs, colleges and students are pushing forward with energy-saving efforts. Colleges are holding light bulb exchanges and upping the efficiency of their buildings as well as their power plants. Students are making individual changes, prodding campus-wide action, and joining kill-a-watt competitions.
Recent polls may explain this this flurry of activity. The 2016 Survey of America’s College Students found that 86% consider global warming a serious problem, up from 80% a year earlier. The 2015 survey found that 76% prefer the United States focus on energy-saving regulations rather than increased energy production.
First steps to a truly awesome dorm room
Considering such collegiate sentiment, we want to help you make a difference. Before shopping or packing, ask these questions: How much stuff do I really need? Could I share rather than buy? Sure, some students will swag out their rooms with energy-guzzling TVs, game consoles, microwaves, or mini-fridges. You can do better.
Find low-cost, efficient alternatives: use an electric kettle rather than a microwave to make coffee; a drying rack instead of the dorm dryer to protect clothes; a desk fan rather than an air conditioner to stay cool; a bike instead of a car to get around town; a tablet rather than a game console to stream media.
If buying electronics or appliances, buy the most efficient models by looking for the blue ENERGY STAR® label. The most important purchase may be an advanced power strip or surge protector, which makes it much easier to turn off devices when they’re not in use. Plug all electronics into this strip and turn it off when you leave.
Some steps only require good behavior. For example, turn off the lights before heading to class. On hot summer days, close the window blinds to keep out the sun’s warmth and reduce air conditioning. On sunny winter days, open them to allow in the sun’s warmth – something known as passive solar heating.
With computers, select power-saving settings and dim your screen, especially at night. Be sure to give your laptop — and yourself — some rest. Otherwise, you could end up like Michael Scott on The Office, who said: ""I'm an early bird and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise and I have worms.""
Make a statement! After focusing on the dorm room, check the dorm facilities to see if they have LEDs, efficient washing machines and dryers, and well-sealed doors and windows. Get involved in campus-wide sustainability. Use #ShrinkYourDormPrint to share photos and info on campus energy-saving efforts.
With perseverance, students can achieve a lot. Here’s a quote from one more famous person – Dr. Seuss, who may remind students of childhood as they leap into adulthood:
“Oh, the places you’ll go! … Kid, you’ll move mountains! ... Get on your way!”
Good luck with your college foray. Have fun, learn a lot (yes, that IS the purpose of college) and don’t forget to text or call home — not to ask for something but simply to say hello.

Energy efficiency deserves center stage during president's Energy Week;"Today the Trump Administration is launching an Energy Week to promote our nation’s “energy dominance” by increasing fossil fuel production. Notably absent in White House plans so far are discussions on how to increase energy efficiency, generally the cheapest way to meet our energy needs. Energy efficiency doesn’t just save us money, it supports millions of jobs. It should be included in a truly great Energy Week.
Energy efficiency is already big. Our recent research report, which evaluated only the electricity sector, estimates that efficiency measures since 1990 have made efficiency our third largest electricity resource, after natural gas and coal. (Broader analyses that go back to the 1970s have found that efficiency is already our nation’s largest energy resource). While this finding may seem strange to some—how can not using power be considered a resource—in reality, it’s simple. Utilities can meet rising electricity demand in two ways: by generating more power or by reducing demand. Utilities encourage customers to use efficient technologies to reduce their energy waste while providing the same level of service. Considered this way, energy efficiency is a resource similar to power plants, wind turbines, or solar panels.
In many areas of the country such as the Northwest, electric utility planners have been relying on energy efficiency for years to keep the lights on. These planners have learned to use efficiency because it’s reliable and generally cheaper than coal, natural gas, and renewables. Our investments in energy efficiency have paid off, saving customers money, reducing pollution, advancing cutting-edge technologies, and creating jobs. Without these investments since 1990, we would need the equivalent of 313 additional large power plants to meet current US energy needs. This is more than three times the coal electricity production in Germany or about two-thirds of the existing coal electricity in the United States. If we consider energy efficiency measures a segment of the US electricity resource “pie,” they would count for 18% of total generation in 2015. Here are graphics from our report:
In recent years, efficiency has rapidly grown as a resource, and it has the potential to increase much more. We already have experience implementing federal, state, and local policies that are proven to work. If the federal government and the states increase measures such as appliance and equipment standards and building codes, efficiency could become our nation’s largest electricity resource by 2030 and provide one-third of our total expected electricity needs. 
Greater energy efficiency will help make great American jobs, too. The Department of Energy estimates that 2.2 million Americans currently work at least part time in designing, installing, and manufacturing energy-efficient products and services. While these workers might be less familiar than coal miners to many, you need to look no farther than your ENERGY STAR® appliances to see the products of their labor. Maximizing our energy efficiency resource could employ hundreds of thousands more Americans, save the nation billions of dollars in energy bills, and leave a lasting example of prudence for future generations.

Clean tax cuts: a new idea with conservative roots;"Congress is likely to tackle federal tax reform in 2017 and may consider new ideas. One proposal it should seriously consider is clean tax cuts—the application of supply-side tax rate cuts to investments that reduce the emissions of harmful pollutants. Cutting tax rates on income gained from clean investments such as energy efficiency improvements could incentivize investors to tap large amounts of private capital.
The Grace Richardson Fund (GRF), an organization with conservative roots and an interest in addressing climate change and other environmental issues, is pioneering the clean tax cut concept. Their view is that conservatives tend to see traditional tax incentives as wasteful, but are interested in tax cuts. They believe that reducing taxes on income from clean investments could increase these investments substantially and help clean the environment.
GRF worked with the Sabin Center at Columbia University and the Rocky Mountain Institute on a charrette to explore and refine the clean tax cut concept. The resulting report spells out the concept in more detail. GRF then decided to sponsor a series of charrette workshops on specific areas where the federal government could offer clean tax cuts and asked ACEEE to host a workshop on clean tax cuts for commercial real estate. In March 2017 we held a charrette workshop with commercial real estate experts, and today we are releasing a white paper on what we found.
Clean tax cuts can potentially work in a wide variety of applications but might be particularly influential in markets where investment returns are passed on to individuals and included on individual tax returns. Such investors are often in above-average tax rate brackets, making tax cuts enticing. Commercial real estate (including multifamily housing) is one such market, where individuals often invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs), limited liability corporations (LLCs), and limited liability partnerships (LLPs). In all of these structures, the returns (or losses) are passed on to the investors to include in their income taxes, making commercial real estate an excellent place to launch the clean tax cut concept.
In our working paper, we provide background information on commercial buildings, commercial real estate structures, and opportunities for additional energy improvements. We then outline two proposals for clean tax cuts for commercial real estate that participants discussed during the charrette. The first proposal aims to provide a lower tax rate (the long-term capital gains rate) on income from buildings that are ENERGY STAR® certified. The second proposal suggests expensing energy efficiency investments that achieve energy savings of at least 10% for all commercial buildings, including those that passed income on to individual tax returns and those were covered by business tax returns.
As we developed the post-workshop paper, we further analyzed these two proposals.  Our analysis finds that the lower tax rate would provide a strong incentive for energy efficiency upgrades in the approximately 30% of the commercial real estate market owned by REITs, LLCs, and LLPs. The immediate expensing would provide a more modest incentive, but applies to about 75% of the commercial real estate market (the proportion of the total market that is taxable). The expensing could also apply to untaxed government and nonprofit buildings if they are allowed to pass the tax value of expensing to the architects, engineers, and contractors who work on efficiency upgrade projects.
As tax reform discussions take shape, ACEEE will suggest a variety of strategies that promote energy efficiency and keep costs to the US Treasury at modest levels. We discussed some options in a 2013 ACEEE report, such ending overly long depreciation periods and focusing tax incentives on transforming markets for more-efficient new and existing homes and commercial buildings. With the release of today’s working paper, we are adding clean tax cuts to the list of ideas that could promote investment and energy as well as energy bill savings and, by extension, economic growth.

Budget ax threatens manufacturing program that puts America first;"For all the talk that comes out of Washington, DC, about the importance of American manufacturing, the government does strikingly little about it. There is no Department of Manufacturing, for example. Fortunately, the Department of Energy has the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO), which is slated for a 68% cut under the proposed 2018 budget.  
AMO embodies the vision of putting America first and could even be renamed the American Manufacturing Office. It promotes the technologies, practices, and workforce that can make American manufacturing internationally competitive. Energy efficiency technologies can reduce industrial energy waste and help improve manufacturing. They can do so while lowering costs, helping our plants compete, creating jobs, and spurring growth.
An economic multiplier effect
Every dollar spent in manufacturing generates between $1.33 and $1.81 in other services and production (see here and here). This multiplier effect in the manufacturing sector is higher than in any other sector of the US economy. Manufacturing jobs spur related job growth, such as in mining, freight, warehousing, engineering, and professional services. Reducing waste through energy efficiency makes advanced manufacturing more competitive. Thus, AMO’s work increases job growth.
Creating knowledge
Central to AMO’s mission is the creation of knowledge that industry can use to innovate new products and processes. AMO programs leverage our national labs to create knowledge. They train students through universities that lead to successful job placement in industry (as well as yielding a new manufacturing focus within universities), and they engage in technological partnerships with industry to transfer that knowledge. These public-private partnerships take many forms to apply the technologies developed and leverage federal resources through the private sector.
As an example, AMO has partnered with the American electric motor industry to develop Next Generation Electric Machines (NGEM). Electric motors account for half of industrial electricity. The partnership leverages our national labs to focus research on the development of next generation electric motors.  The initiative also leverages DOE’s Power America Institute collaborative between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and several companies and universities to bring cutting-edge knowledge on semiconductors to this research. Just replacing less-efficient motors could reduce industrial electricity consumption by 2–4% and yield up to $2.7 billion in annual electricity savings.
Targeting small business and medium-sized businesses
AMO’s efforts target small business and medium-sized businesses through technical assistance. Small businesses are an engine for job creation. Yet, small businesses and medium-sized companies usually do not have the necessary resources to apply innovative technology. AMO provides the needed technical assistance to achieve growth and international competitiveness.
As the largest federal initiative focused on advanced manufacturing, AMO puts America first and boosts the American economy at its roots, making American businesses grow through energy efficiency. The proposed 2018 budget, however, threatens to slash or eliminate key AMO programs, highlighted below. We call on Congress to reject such cuts and to support American manufacturing.
Key AMO examples
Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs) perform energy assessments of small businesses and medium-sized industrial facilities (annual energy bills $100,000 to $2.5 million), while also providing workforce training and successful job placement. IACs are located at 28 universities nationwide. They provide invaluable field experience that trains approximately 300 students each year to perform the assessments. Since the program’s inception in 1976, students have performed more than 16,000 assessments. Upon graduation, 53% have gone on to work for companies, helping them to save even more energy. A study commissioned by DOE in 2015 evaluated the performance of the program over 15 years (1997-2013) and confirmed the measurable impact it has had on both energy savings and job skills development.
Combined Heat and Power Technical Assistant Partnerships (CHP TAPs) perform market analyses, educate stakeholders, and provide technical assistance for combined heat and power (CHP), one of the single largest opportunities to save energy in the manufacturing sector. When most power plants make electricity, they waste two-thirds of the energy contained in the fuels they use. CHP, or “cogeneration,” captures the waste energy and uses it for other purposes. Only a fraction of the potential to use CHP has been realized in the United States. AMO funds seven CHP TAPs to help hundreds of organizations each year assess the features and benefits of CHP. More than 280 CHP projects are under development or online, with an estimated installed capacity of more than 2 gigawatts.
Manufacturing Demonstration Facility (MDF), located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is focused on developing new knowledge on additive manufacturing and production of low-cost carbon fiber. The MDF has formed a collaborative that shares a common R&D infrastructure. It engages in pre-competitive manufacturing, development of best practices, and sharing of know-how including design and processing tools, qualification, and certification approaches.
ISO 50001 Ready helps small businesses and medium-sized businesses implement best practices through technical assistance. The ISO 50001 Energy Management Standard is the gold standard for systematic energy management and savings. Thousands of companies around the world have invested in training their workforces to implement these best practices. Through a suite of online tools, ISO 50001 Ready makes these benefits accessible to small business at a fraction of the cost they would otherwise incur. When applying both ISO 50001 and the Superior Energy Performance (SEP) program, businesses achieved, on average, verified energy intensity improvement rates more than four times larger than their prior rates.

The results are in: here are the most energy-efficient utilities in the US;"Our first-ever scorecard of US utilities, released today, reveals striking regional differences and identifies the best — and worst — performers on energy efficiency. The 2017 Utility Energy Efficiency Scorecard looks at the performance of the 51 largest electric utilities in the United States and highlights cutting-edge efforts. Topping the list are Eversource Massachusetts and National Grid Massachusetts, which both earned the same score. Rounding out the top five are Pacific Gas & Electric, Baltimore Gas & Electric, and Eversource Connecticut.
Map showing the utilities in the scorecard, denoting the top performers.
Utilities are the primary providers of energy efficiency programs for US electricity customers. These programs deliver enormous benefits to households and businesses. Efficiency lowers customer bills, allows utilities to avoid or defer building new power plants or other infrastructure, and reduces local pollutants associated with electricity generation.
We wanted to dig further into this topic to determine which utilities are doing the best on energy efficiency programs and how others can improve. Typical programs encourage the purchase of efficient appliances, lighting, and heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) — both at home and in other places such as commercial kitchens and restaurants.
  Leading utilities sometimes undertake 20 or more efficiency programs. Only a few utilities take some of the more forward-thinking approaches such as promoting smart thermostats, residential geo-targeting, zero net energy buildings, and advanced space-heating heat pumps.
This report, the newest addition to our Scorecard series, is a first-of-its-kind deep dive into utility-sector energy efficiency efforts. It provides an important data baseline to assess energy efficiency in the utility sector.
The results are in
At the top of the list, Eversource Massachusetts and National Grid Massachusetts both earn 91% of total points. Both achieved more than 3% savings as a percentage of their retail sales in 2015 — a notable achievement. The top 10 show impressive commitment to efficiency through a wide range of long-term programs and policies.
The top and the bottom utilities
Based on 2015 data, we examined 18 metrics across three categories including quantitative savings and spending performance, program diversity and emerging areas, and efficiency-related regulatory issues. Notable findings:
Some regions scored much better than others. Utilities in the Northeast, the highest-scoring region, earned, on average, 62% of total points, followed closely by those in the West, which earned 57%. The Northeast average is more than twice that of utilities in the Southeast, the lowest-scoring region, and nearly twice that of utilities in the mid-Atlantic. 
Five of the bottom 10 utilities are in the Southeast, and seven of the top 10 are in either the Northeast or the West. 
The top 10 invested a higher percentage of total revenue on energy efficiency. They spent an average of 6% of revenue on efficiency programs; the bottom 10 invested an average of 0.7%. The overall average was 2.7%.  
Utilities saved more energy than they planned. On average, they saved 0.89% of retail sales, compared to the average target of 0.77%. 
The top utilities are located in the top-performing states. Nine of the top 10 utilities are located in states that also break the top 10 in our State Scorecard. 
The 51 utilities, on average, used efficiency programs to reduce by 0.79% the peak demand for power, which is typically the costliest to generate. 
The most common efficiency programs were residential HVAC and industrial and commercial custom measures. 
Three Texas utilities scored in the top 10 on the low-income program metric. This includes CPS Energy, which directed more than half of its portfolio expenditures to low-income programs. 
Thirty-nine utilities earned a point for offering residential time-of-use rates. Arizona Public Service and Salt River Project in Arizona have high subscription levels; more than half (51%) of the former and nearly a third (31%) of the latter subscribe to these rates. 
Fewer than half (24) of utilities earned full points for evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V), which can increase savings by providing guidance on how to improve programs. 
Overall, scores vary widely among the 51 utilities, leaving a lot of room for improvement. The five utilities with the most room to grow are Ohio Edison, Florida Power and Light, Entergy LA, Dominion Energy, and Alabama Power.
The report shows impressive and exemplary utility commitment to offering customers energy efficiency services. The findings underscore that state and regulatory support as well as company commitment are critical for high achievement. We are pleased to provide this snapshot of utility-sector efficiency and hope it will help promote effective program design and implementation.
Webinar and regional insights
Tune in next week to our webinar, where we’ll dive even more deeply into the results of the Scorecard with additional reactions from regional energy efficiency organizations across the United States.
How we developed the rankings
We developed metrics that span a wide range of vital utility-sector efficiency programs and performance, each with a point value relative to its importance to utility-sector energy efficiency. We focus on 2015 performance but also on long-term planning and innovation, which are critical to the continued inclusion of energy efficiency as a utility resource. The metrics aim to evaluate performance in a specific utility service territory, although we recognize that utilities operate under complex regulatory and policy landscapes.
The report, which received no utility funding, focuses on the 51 largest electric utilities by retail sales volume. It specifically looks at state jurisdictional utilities rather than parent or holding companies. We include utility-funded programs, both those operated directly by utilities and those operated by third-party administrators with funding from utilities.
We collected public utility filings, reports, and documents to create an initial data set, and worked with utility and other contacts to fill in gaps and confirm data. In some cases, data was adjusted for accurate comparison across utilities. All 51 utilities were provided the opportunity to review the report before its publication.

Join our countdown to ACEEE’s first Utility Energy Efficiency Scorecard;"What is your utility doing to promote energy efficiency? Could it be doing more? Find out in ACEEE’s first Utility Energy Efficiency Scorecard, to be released on Wednesday, June 14, 2017. Get excited about this first-of-its-kind, comprehensive look at utility-sector energy efficiency performance by joining our countdown to its release. Here are 10 things to look for:
Ten days will pass until the Scorecard debuts. The report looks at the 51 largest electric utilities in the United States and awards points in three broad categories across 18 metrics of utility-sector energy efficiency. A total of 50 points is available.
Nine utilities ran programs to reduce miscellaneous plug loads in 2015. This is one of the programs considered under the Scorecard’s “emerging program areas” metric.
Eight points are available for net incremental savings as a percentage of revenue. This metric has more potential points than any other in the Scorecard.
Seven utilities in the Scorecard are in mid-Atlantic states. How did these utilities fare compared to those in other regions?
Six metrics inform scores for Category Three. Some of the metrics include energy savings targets, rate design, and evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V). A couple of utilities earned perfect scores in Category Three. Which ones?
Five utilities earned full points for the “program diversity” metric. Make sure to find out how many different efficiency programs these utilities ran in 2015 (hint: it’s probably more than you think).
Four utilities in the Scorecard are from California. Did any earn the top spot as California did when it tied with Massachusetts in ACEEE’s 2017 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard?
Three points are available to utilities for low-income energy efficiency programs. Check the report to find out if any got a perfect score.
Two aspects of rate design are considered in the Scorecard. We look at both customer charges and time-of-use pricing.
First place goes to...? Tweet your guesses to @ACEEEdc with the hashtag #UtilityScorecard.

Ohio Opt-Out Will Cost State Billions in Benefits;"Our new research shows that utility customers would pay a hefty price if more large customers were allowed to opt out of energy efficiency programs. In Ohio’s case, they would pay billions of dollars. Fundamental fairness suggests that because these programs benefit everyone, everyone should pay for them.
The Ohio legislature is weighing whether to allow more large customers such as manufacturers to leave customer-funded energy efficiency programs. When a large customer opts out, it no longer has to pay the programs’ costs. We’ve published several blog posts and papers about the potential problems with this policy. You can read those posts here, here, and here.
Our report estimates the opt-out costs for Ohio, which introduced a limited policy for large customers in 2014. Now the state is debating whether to expand this policy to exempt more customers. The policy would reduce opportunities for Ohio utilities to save energy and substantially increase costs for their customers, who have benefitted from program savings for the past decade.
Higher Utility Costs
The primary benefit of energy efficiency programs is to reduce utility system costs. These costs include energy, generating capacity, and transmission/distribution infrastructure. An expanded opt-out would increase electric demand, leading to higher utility system costs. Increased costs would ultimately lead to higher electric rates and bills for all customers in Ohio.
Our Ohio analysis focuses on a midrange scenario that assumes 35% of total customers opt out over the next 10 years. We estimate that utility system costs could increase by approximately $1.85 billion under an expanded opt-out. The majority of increased costs from the opt-out would be collected from all customers in Ohio through increased rates. There would also be cost impacts beyond what we estimated in our analysis. In a previous study, ACEEE estimated the value of market price suppression could exceed $2 billion by 2020 based on meeting Ohio’s original energy efficiency goals. All Ohio electric customers will have to pay these higher costs.
Higher Health Costs
Energy efficiency also reduces air pollution by lessening reliance on traditional power plants. Air emissions from fossil fuel power plants contain several harmful pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and particulate matter. These pollutants cause damage to human health. Several studies have quantified the economic value of health harms related to electric power pollution. An expanded opt-out would increase health-related costs because of an increase in traditional power plant air pollution.
We estimate that the increased health costs for Ohio could be up to $1.27 billion under an expanded opt-out. This value is also based on the midrange scenario assuming 35% of total customers opt out over the next 10 years. Under this scenario, we estimate an increase of over 18,000 tons of SO2, 5,700 tons of NOx, 1,800 tons of PM 2.5, and 7.3 million tons of CO2.
Higher Bills for Large Customers
Participating in energy efficiency programs can substantially reduce customer bills. These savings are invaluable to many businesses that seek to reduce costs. They also spur economic growth as businesses can reinvest instead of paying higher electricity bills.
Ironically, opting out of efficiency programs is likely to end up costing large customers more than $3.3 billion. While businesses are less likely to make investments with payback periods longer than two to three years, regulated utilities routinely make longer-term investments. By reducing project costs through utility rebates, companies can make investments they would not have made without the program.
Opting Out of Opt-out
Our analysis estimates substantial cost increases for Ohio: total utility system costs would exceed $1.85 billion from 2015 to 2024, increased health-related costs would exceed $1.2 billion, and customers would lose more than $3.3 billion in bill savings from not participating in programs. Also, an expanded opt-out policy would also likely reduce jobs and lower the state gross domestic product, based on analysis we’ve done in other states. 
We highlight costs of an expanded opt-out policy in Ohio but expect similar consequences in other states. Policymakers should opt out of policies that increase costs for customers and work instead to improve efficiency programs that benefit us all.

Funding for energy efficiency is at risk in Connecticut, and it’s worse than before;"A year ago I wrote about a threat to energy efficiency funding in Connecticut. Lawmakers had proposed using Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) funds earmarked for energy efficiency projects to fill holes in the budget.
Now that misguided proposal is back, and it’s even worse than before. Not only are state lawmakers going after RGGI funding, but they’re also considering diverting $160 million annually in utility ratepayer dollars currently earmarked for energy efficiency programs to make up budget shortfalls over the next two fiscal years.
This proposal would be a devastating blow to the state’s economy and all utility ratepayers. It would also represent a real change of course for the state. In 2016, Connecticut ranked fifth in our State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. But remaining a leader depends on consistent, secure funding for efficiency programs. It depends on lawmakers who can see the big picture, prioritizing long-term economic gains through the promotion of energy efficiency jobs, utility bill savings, and health benefits. This proposal does the opposite.
The legislative proposal would divert 64% of ratepayer funds that are supposed to be invested in energy efficiency into the general fund, wiping out one of the most cost-effective ways for utilities to make sure the lights stay on for their customers. While it’s true that lawmakers have big holes to fill in the budget, using energy efficiency dollars as a plug would have a much more serious impact than they might realize. According to Acadia Center, every $1 invested in energy efficiency saves Connecticut residents and businesses $3.89. The state would lose a whole lot more than it would gain through this proposal.
Defunding energy efficiency would hurt Connecticut at nearly every level. Every year energy efficiency programs generate hundreds of millions of dollars in lifetime utility bill savings. Programs delivered by utilities in 2016 alone will ultimately save customers more than $960 million. Eliminating these programs would have a long-lasting impact, increasing energy bills across the state and limiting the options for businesses and residents to control their energy use.
The costs of cutting programs won’t just show up on utility bills. With nearly 12,500 Connecticut residents working in energy efficiency-related jobs, wiping out project opportunities would also eliminate jobs in this growing sector of the economy. 
On an even broader scale, big cuts to efficiency programs such as those proposed would have significant public health implications. Studies have shown that energy efficiency measures such as adding insulation and improving central heating improve health outcomes, reducing respiratory illness and allergies. So while $160 million may fill some holes in the budget, the costs of increased emergency room visits combined with higher power costs are likely to do far more damage to the state.
Given the situation in Washington, DC, state leadership is more important than ever. While lawmakers in Connecticut have placed some misguided policy proposals on the table, we hope that they’ll right their course and remain leaders in energy efficiency.

Save Energy, Save Lives: Announcing ACEEE’s newest program, Health and Environment;"Spring is peak season for allergies and asthma. As a result, May has been declared National Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. While our air is getting cleaner overall, the number of people with asthma keeps growing. One out of every 13 people in the United States has asthma, now the most common chronic disease that sends our kids to the hospital. Each year, we spend more than $50 billion treating asthma.
We don’t have a cure for asthma, but we do know what causes attacks. Mold, exposure to cold air or sudden temperature changes, air pollution, and pollen are all culprits. Fortunately, these triggers can be managed, reduced, and in some cases even eliminated through energy efficiency measures. Sealing holes that let moisture into a house helps prevent mold, reduces the influx of outdoor pollution, and eliminates exposure to drafts and sudden temperature changes. Changing your furnace’s filters ensures that particles in the air don’t circulate throughout your house. And in addition to the direct health benefits of efficiency measures, evaluating a home’s performance allows you to address key health and safety issues. Do you have a working smoke detector? Is carbon monoxide in your home? These simple questions can save lives.
Energy efficiency doesn’t just protect indoor health; it cleans outside air by reducing pollution from fossil fuel combustion. Power plants and vehicles create pollution by burning fossil fuels, causing hospitalizations and premature deaths. Energy efficiency policies have reduced the pollution of hundreds of power plants and improved the fuel economy of tens of millions of new vehicles. Yet four out of every 10 people in the US still live where the air is unhealthy
At ACEEE we recognize that increasing energy efficiency doesn’t just save us money; it improves public health. Today ACEEE is launching a Health and Environment program with a team dedicated to helping people understand how energy efficiency affects our health--both indoors and out.
Meet the team
  Sara Hayes manages the Health and Environment program. Sara oversees a research team focused on identifying strategies and opportunities to use energy efficiency to reduce pollution and improve human health. She serves on the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Air Act Advisory Committee.
Cassandra Kubes is a senior research analyst of environmental policy. Cassandra leads the team’s efforts to support advocates and policymakers in states and cities working to use energy efficiency to reduce pollution and protect health.
JR Denson is an analyst focusing on public health, including programs that address people’s health and energy needs. JR supports policymakers, advocates, and ACEEE programs as they consider energy efficiency policies and programs that address health and justice in communities across the nation.
While the links between health, environment, and energy efficiency are compelling, they aren’t yet broadly understood by elected officials, public health experts, or air pollution regulators who design programs and develop policy. ACEEE’s Health and Environment program will conduct original research and educate policymakers about how energy efficiency improves health.
Looking for exemplary programs and good news stories
We’re asking you to help identify exemplary programs that are currently improving health while saving energy in buildings. Anyone can nominate a program, and the process is simple.
We also want to hear your stories. Have you done an energy efficiency upgrade in your home or workspace that improved your well being or uncovered unknown dangers? For example, have you noticed less coughing or fewer drafts? Do you feel safer or more comfortable because your home performs better and has lower energy bills? If you have a good news story to share, please email us at EEStories@aceee.org.

Doing more with less: How the US economy grows while energy use falls;"ACEEE started our DataPoint series of informative graphs in December 2015, with the first one on energy intensity and how it relates to energy efficiency. It provided data on US energy intensity and efficiency improvements from 1980–2014. Now two more years of data are available, and a revised figure is below. 
In the past two years, US energy use has declined 1%, while gross domestic product (GDP) has increased 4.25%.  As a result, our energy intensity (energy use per dollar of GDP) has improved by 2.5% per year, a little better than the 2.0% per year compound rate we averaged over the 1980–2014 period.  As noted in our 2015 blog post, based on a variety of studies, we estimate that about 60% of the improvement is due to energy efficiency improvements and 40% to structural changes in our economy (e.g., our growing service economy).
Two years is a short period, and it will take several more years of data to see if this increase continues. Also, it is hard to determine what is causing the increase, but possible explanations include mounting savings from appliance and equipment efficiency standards and vehicle efficiency standards, warmer weather, and increasing utility and other local energy efficiency programs (e.g., ACEEE’s 2016 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard found that incremental savings from programs were 0.7% of electricity sales in 2015; 2016 data not yet available).

New standard practice manual for cost-effectiveness is an indispensable resource;"On May 18th the National Efficiency Screening Project and E4TheFuture announced the release of the first National Standard Practice Manual (NSPM). The detailed manual guides regulators on how to develop their own jurisdictional cost-effectiveness tests of utility customer-funded energy efficiency programs. More than 40 key organizations and national experts reviewed the manual.
Time for a refresh
Few areas of utility energy efficiency policies and procedures possess as much diversity of opinion as cost-effectiveness testing. Virtually every state uses some version of the five tests outlined in the California Standard Practice Manual (CA SPM). But as we documented in a 2012 study, substantial variability exists in how states define and calculate those tests. There is concern that the CA SPM has become somewhat dated (the last major revision was in 2001), and implementation of the tests has become inconsistent. While there is an impression that states use “standard tests” for calculating cost-effectiveness, the practical reality is very different. Implementation is often ad hoc and poorly documented.
Rather than prescribe standard tests that everyone should use, the NSPM begins with the premise that each jurisdiction (typically a state, but it could also be a municipality or other territory served by a public utility) should develop its own primary cost-effectiveness test to reflect its guiding policies. Rather than standard tests, the NSPM offers core principles and a systematic process (the Resource Value Framework [PDF]) for jurisdictions to develop their own primary cost-effectiveness tests.
A how-to guide
The NSPM lays out six core principles:
Assess efficiency as a utility resource
Incorporate applicable policy goals of the jurisdiction
Create symmetry for both costs and benefits
Conduct a forward-looking analysis
Include all relevant impacts
Assure transparency for all inputs, assumptions, methodologies, and results
The NSPM then provides a step-by-step process for developing a primary test, followed by extensive information and examples for dealing with common technical issues in assessing cost-effectiveness. Issues addressed include defining and estimating utility system impacts, accounting for impacts external to the utility system, determining discount rates, defining the analysis period, dealing with free-riders and spillover, and accounting for rate and bill impacts.
We hope the NSPM will become an indispensable resource for regulatory staff and anyone else involved in assessing the cost-effectiveness of utility energy efficiency programs. Readers are encouraged to check out the NSPM and watch for more information and announcements at upcoming events.
(In full disclosure, I was one of the five primary authors of this NSPM.  The team was led by Tim Woolf and Chris Neme, with assistance from myself, Steve Schiller and Tom Eckman, and management assistance from Julie Michals.)

Is CHP part of your vision for the modern grid? Let’s discuss;"More states are undertaking new approaches to utility planning that prioritize clean, distributed energy resources, but few are considering combined heat and power (CHP) for meeting the demands of the modern grid. In many ways, CHP provides exactly what they need.
ACEEE is doing some of the first research to evaluate CHP as a grid resource. We are looking at CHP’s role as an alternative to traditional utility investments and as a support for broader adoption of distributed energy resources. Why now? Policymakers and planners are seeking efficient, low-cost resources that are highly reliable and flexible enough to support more distributed grid resources.
Why CHP can deliver what systems planners need
CHP is more than just an energy-efficient method of generating electricity and thermal energy. It has the potential to deliver lower overall system costs, stronger critical infrastructure, and improved grid reliability. It can also yield significantly fewer emissions than conventional power plants and support state-level economic development.
The benefits can be even greater depending on where CHP is located and how it is deployed. Most people typically think of CHP as providing baseload capacity, generating electricity and thermal energy consistently throughout the day. In addition to providing an always-on source of power, modern CHP systems are capable of acting as a more flexible resource, offering key grid-supporting services needed to maintain operations and help balance distribution. States and utilities that carefully consider these attributes of CHP in their resource plans are likely to find it’s a useful solution that minimizes system costs and maximizes customer benefits.
What’s the problem?
So far, CHP’s benefits remain undervalued. This situation partly explains why we have not come close to realizing CHP’s potential for new deployment in the United States. For one, CHP has historically been at odds with the electric utility’s business model, because customers buy less electricity after it’s installed. Plus, most existing policies and utility regulations are not designed to allow utilities to monetize all of CHP’s value streams, such as increased reliability and reduced emissions. But the electricity industry is changing, and utilities and policymakers are beginning to broaden their view on how to meet future energy needs.
New research exploring CHP as a grid resource
Prior ACEEE research has documented the value CHP could bring to electric utilities if policies and regulations encouraged utility investments. This year, ACEEE is undertaking a new research project to explore how policymakers and system planners can better integrate CHP as a resource into future system planning. We’re exploring how utilities can have a stake in financing, building, and operating CHP themselves, using it to support greater integration of distributed energy resources in their service territories. Our goal is to highlight a vision for how to incorporate CHP into integrated resource planning or other long-term strategies, and to demonstrate CHP’s capabilities for meeting modern grid needs through real-world examples.
When I imagine the future grid, I see CHP systems meeting onsite energy needs at universities, hospitals, multifamily buildings, and industrial facilities. I envision them replacing and upgrading old grid infrastructure, minimizing big investments in central power plants, and supporting more distributed energy resources that provide clean power.
What do you see? We’re interested in hearing from you and welcome your input by email or in person at ACEEE’s Industrial Summer Study, where we’ll discuss this topic and present early research findings. We invite you to join the conversation.

ACEEE Statement: Proposed FY18 Budget Would Kill Jobs by Targeting Energy Efficiency Programs;"Statement by Steven Nadel, ACEEE Executive Director
For all the talk about increasing US jobs, the president’s budget takes a meat cleaver to the largest job creator in the energy sector: energy efficiency. It seeks crippling cuts to federal programs that transform waste into wealth and help support 2.2 million energy efficiency jobs.
The budget proposes to eliminate the popular ENERGY STAR® program that saves consumers money and slash others at the Environmental Protection Agency that cut fuel costs for cars and trucks. It seeks to end all federal funds for home weatherization and impose a cut of approximately 70% to the energy efficiency programs at the Department of Energy. These programs lower energy bills for households, businesses, and the federal government itself, all while creating domestic jobs.
We call on Congress to reject these draconian cuts and continue its bipartisan support for energy efficiency.

ACEEE Announces New Senior Director for Policy and Federal Policy Manager;"Washington, DC—ACEEE has restructured its policy leadership, adding a new senior director for policy and a new federal policy manager. “These new appointments allow us to better focus our energy efficiency policy expertise and outreach,” said ACEEE’s executive director Steve Nadel.
Maggie Molina, who has been with ACEEE since 2005 and has shaped the organization’s increasing focus on state and local policies, has been promoted to senior director for policy. In her new role, Maggie will oversee ACEEE’s work in federal, state, and local policy as well as in utility regulatory matters. She will serve on the organization’s five-person executive management team, which includes another new member: Wendy Koch, senior director of marketing and communications.
“I am thrilled to take on this role and ready to tackle the opportunities and challenges that we face on energy efficiency in a fast-changing policy environment,” Molina said.
Pasha Majdi joins ACEEE as federal policy manager. In this new role, Pasha will guide federal policy strategy by engaging with congressional and agency staff as well as other critical government entities and stakeholders. He will work with both Maggie Molina and Lowell Ungar, senior policy advisor, as part of ACEEE’s Federal Policy Program, which for decades has provided policymakers with a central source of analysis and technical assistance on national energy legislation.
Prior to joining ACEEE, Pasha served as professional staff on the US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for its ranking member and now chairman, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). He handled a broad and unique portfolio, primarily related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, electricity markets, and EPA regulations.
“ACEEE stands out in Washington’s energy policy circle as a credible and independent source of technical expertise,” Majdi said.  “I am excited to get started, tapping into the organization’s expertise to inform energy efficiency policy solutions that reduce energy waste and create economic growth.”

Silent Saver Under Attack: Why We Need the Building Technologies Office;"Are you happy to have cheap, efficient light bulbs that don’t flicker and hum? How about a large refrigerator that uses less electricity than the old incandescent bulb? A small government office has played a key role in all of these innovations and now helps the average American family save almost $500 each year in lower energy bills.
Yet this silent saver is under attack. Like ENERGY STAR® and other effective federal energy efficiency programs, the Building Technologies Office (BTO) would be slashed in the administration’s proposed budget for 2018. It may not be “sexy,” as the last president once called insulation. But few offices are more important to consumers.
Our recent fact sheet shows how BTO helps consumers save money, creates jobs, fosters innovation, makes businesses more competitive, and helps states and local governments. BTO is one of 11 program offices in the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office, which in turn is a small part of the Department of Energy.
At a cost of less than $2 per household, BTO is helping you save almost $500. Actually, that’s just in appliances, equipment, and lighting covered by efficiency standards that BTO issues. BTO helps throughout what I call the virtuous spiral of energy efficiency market transformation.
Research and Development: There are about 50,000 home builders in this country. Most of them don’t have R&D budgets. So BTO, along with the national labs and universities it supports, is critical to developing new energy efficiency technologies like the ones I mention above. For example, Mark Modera and colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab recognized that a lot of the energy used to heat and cool buildings escapes through leaks in the ducts. They developed a new way to seal those leaks by blowing particles through the ducts that plug the holes as the air leaks out. He started a company, Aeroseal, which makes the equipment and sealant in Centerville, OH, and trains people around the country and the world to use it.
Last month BTO released a report that highlights 27 technologies, as well as 112 LED lighting components, that BTO helped develop and that resulted in commercial products between 2010 and 2015. There is a refrigerator that separates the cooling from the freezing, a smart control for air conditioner fans, cheaper and better LEDs, windows that become darker or lighter as needed, a sprayable sealant, improved manufacturing of windows and LEDs, building energy management software, and more.
From lab to market: The technologies BTO develops don’t save energy unless someone uses them, so BTO works on commercialization too. Its Building America program works with teams of builders to incorporate new technologies in more efficient and comfortable homes. For example, it has worked with Habitat for Humanity volunteers to build super-efficient homes for low-income families in Denver, CO, and Lenoir City, TN, and efficient homes throughout the Gulf Coast and the nation.
Facilitating use: Other BTO initiatives help bring those technologies into more widespread use. The Home Energy Score shows the efficiency of existing homes and ways that families can save on their energy bills, including sealing their ducts. Home Performance with ENERGY STAR (BTO runs this part of ENERGY STAR) has helped more than 600,000 families in communities throughout the country get quality energy upgrades to their homes, thus creating jobs in construction, equipment installation, and manufacturing.
Universal savings: When the technologies are widespread and cost-effective, they can justify standards that ensure a minimum level of energy performance for all homeowners. BTO helps develop effective building energy codes for homes and commercial buildings, helps states adopt the codes, and helps builders show they meet them with tools like ResCHECK. Buildings built to new codes could save $150 billion (net present value) compared to efficiency levels a decade ago.
Research and Development: The standards form a base for the development of even better technologies. Light bulb standards have led the way to cheap, efficient LED bulbs, and now BTO is working with companies to expand LEDs to other kinds of bulbs and to develop organic LEDs, which might be used in flexible panels rather than bulbs. Thus the efficiency spiral circles back, but with greater energy savings and greater economic and environmental benefits.
Homes built since 2000 are on average about 30% larger than older homes but use roughly the same amount of energy. BTO innovation and assistance has been essential for those savings and for the jobs, better comfort, more stable electric grid, and reduced air pollution that result. Funding a robust and diversified buildings research and deployment program will be just as essential to future savings.

How to jump-start the financing of infrastructure and efficiency? Join our discussion;"President Trump’s position on clean energy has deviated from his predecessor’s, and the new political climate raises questions about how clean energy investment will fare in the future. After 100 days of the Trump administration, there is still some uncertainty, but one big opportunity.
Infrastructure improvement, an idea championed by the current administration and an area of historical bipartisanship, is an opportunity for energy efficiency at the federal level. The president has signaled that a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan may be ready within the next few weeks, potentially putting a dent in an estimated $4.5 trillion need.
Energy efficiency can play a crucial and complementary role. It reduces the cost of infrastructure, which in turn reduces energy waste. Efficiency improvements in residential and commercial buildings reduce infrastructure investment costs by deferring upgrades for utility transmission and distribution. Financing infrastructure improvements such as grid modernization reduces energy waste.
So how do we secure financing for both? Because cost is a major hurdle, the new administration has suggested public-private partnerships as a way to stretch taxpayer dollars. Although the exact nature of the partnerships is still up for debate, entities such as green banks are examples of how to successfully supplement public funds with private capital to complete projects. Additionally, previous iterations of President Trump’s plan included increasing the size of state revolving loan funds, another investment vehicle that can be used to leverage public funds for energy efficiency. For instance, revolving loan funds in Nebraska and Texas are hundred-million-dollar success stories despite the policy changes of five different US presidents.
At our upcoming Energy Efficiency Finance Forum, we’ll discuss these possibilities and other successful collaborations between the public and private sectors. They include Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE). This week, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer credited PACE for part of his city’s improved score in ACEEE’s new City Energy Efficiency Scorecard. “Through collaborations with our business, nonprofit, and academic community,” Dyer said, Orlando enabled PACE financing, which “unlocked more than $500M for residential and commercial property owners.”
Such financing can offer consumers and the government both lower energy bills and improved infrastructure.
At our forum, industry experts, corporations, green banks, foundations, and state officials will describe their vision for the future. They will talk about infrastructure, resilience, public-private partnerships, and new financing strategies. Curious how philanthropic investments can unlock other sources of capital? We’ll explore that topic with a panel of impact investing experts from the Kresge, MacArthur, and Surdna Foundations. If you want to know what the future of clean energy looks like, you will get a glimpse at Finance Forum, May 21-23 in Chicago.

Cities Boost Efforts to Reduce Energy Waste: Here's How They Rank;"Scorecard of 51 large cities reveals the top 10, including Boston, NYC, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Portland. Orlando, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Kansas City among those most improved.
Washington, DC—As the federal government weighs budget cuts to energy efficiency programs, cities are stepping up efforts to reduce energy waste. More mayors and local lawmakers in America’s largest cities are turning to energy efficiency to reduce energy costs for consumers and businesses, strengthen the resilience of their communities, and reduce pollution, according to the third edition of the City Energy Efficiency Scorecard, released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
The ACEEE report finds that Boston remains the top US city for energy efficiency, receiving 84.5 out of a possible 100 points, an improvement of 2.5 from its 2015 score. Following Boston, the top 10 US cities for energy efficiency are New York City (#2), Seattle (#3), Los Angeles (tied for #4), Portland (tied for #4), Austin (#6), Chicago (#7), Washington, DC (#8), Denver (tied for #9), and San Francisco (tied for #9).  
Based on a 25-point jump from the last edition of the Scorecard in 2015, Los Angeles was the most-improved city. It entered the top five—and the top 10—for the first time. San Diego, Kansas City, and Phoenix are the second, third, and fourth most-improved cities, respectively. Seven other cities, including Orlando, showed double-digit improvements since the last Scorecard.
The five cities most in need of improvement on energy efficiency are Hartford (#47), Memphis (#48), Detroit (#49), Oklahoma City (#50), and Birmingham (#51).
Additional findings in the 2017 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard include the following:
Phoenix is the fourth most-improved city, with a gain of 13 points. The city increased its score in community-wide initiatives because of its adoption of the 2050 Environmental Sustainability goals, which include both energy savings and climate goals.
Orlando is another of 11 cities that improved by at least 10 points. It aims to improve efficiency in existing buildings by benchmarking its energy use and making the data transparent and accessible. Austin, Philadelphia, Denver, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Portland, and the four most-improved cities mentioned above round out this group.
Los Angeles is home to a new Existing Building Energy and Water Efficiency program, which requires an energy audit, retrofit, and benchmarking for many commercial and multifamily buildings, as well as water efficiency measures.
San Diego passed a Climate Action Plan that established goals to reduce energy use by 15% in select homes and to reduce community-wide greenhouse gas emissions emissions by 15% by 2020.
“Across the nation, cities are taking steps to save energy, and they are creating more economically vibrant and resilient communities in the process,” said ACEEE senior researcher David Ribeiro, the lead report author. “More than half, 32, of the 51 cities improved their scores from 2015 to 2017, with several making substantial point increases. More cities are requiring building owners to benchmark and report buildings' energy use, updating building energy codes, and setting community-wide goals to save energy and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We also see a new set of cities emerging as leaders for energy efficiency, knocking on the door of the top 10.”
Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said: ""Being recognized as America's most energy-efficient city is an accomplishment that should be shared by all Bostonians. Whether you're a resident who lowered their monthly utility bill through Renew Boston or an owner of one of our city's leading green buildings, we should all be proud of our success to reduce energy and save money.""
Los Angles Mayor Eric Garcetti said: “Building a sustainable Los Angeles is not a task for the distant future, it is a goal we are accomplishing right now with our Sustainable City pLAn, and through smart, bold investments in energy efficiency. The progress we have made on ACEEE’s City Energy Efficiency Scorecard — moving up 24 places in just four years — shows just how committed we are to making our buildings greener, and creating a sustainable Los Angeles for the next generation.”
San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer said: “This new ranking shows how far we’ve come in creating a more energy-efficient city in recent years. We’re now the number one city for solar panel installations in the country, we are using cleaner-burning fuels in our city vehicles, and we have committed to powering our city by 100% renewable energy. With the passage of our landmark Climate Action Plan, we’re setting the example for how to build a better and cleaner future for the next generation.”
Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton said: “Phoenix has made major strides toward becoming a carbon-neutral, zero-waste city with an economy built for the 21st century. Phoenix exceeded its 2015 goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is offering incentives to building owners to make their properties more energy efficient, working to make its own city buildings more energy efficient, and converting all 100,000 city streetlights to LEDs. This recognition is another milestone in what has been a historic sustainability comeback for Phoenix in just the past few years. Most recently, Phoenix began rolling out its voter-approved Transportation 2050 program—the largest green infrastructure investment in city history. We’ve already boosted bus service and dial-a-ride for our residents and will triple light rail in the next few decades. T2050 is a game-changer for Phoenix and puts us in prime position to remain at the top of the ACEEE rankings for many years to come.”
Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said: ""Over the last year, we have made great strides to dramatically increase the energy efficiency of Orlando's buildings and transportation fleet. Through collaborations with our business, nonprofit, and academic community, we enabled the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing tool that unlocked more than $500M for residential and commercial property owners and passed a historic energy and water benchmarking, transparency, and energy audit policy for the largest public- and private-sector buildings in Orlando. In addition, we've transitioned much of our city-owned fleet to alternative fuels and deployed millions of dollars to improve the efficiency of our city-owned buildings, saving taxpayers more than $1.4M from previous years. Through these efforts and others, we will continue to save significant amounts of money, reduce public health impacts and greenhouse gas emissions, preserve natural resources, and accelerate our local clean energy economy—all things that will improve the sustainability of our city.""
In the five key areas covered by the report, the key findings are:
Local Government Operations. Leaders in efficiency in local government operations are Denver, New York City, Philadelphia, Portland, and Washington, DC. All have policies to increase efficiency in city government, procurement, and asset management.
Community-Wide Initiatives. The top-scoring cities in community-wide initiatives are Austin, Minneapolis, Portland, and Washington, DC. They have efficiency-related goals for the entire community and strategies to mitigate urban heat islands. They also have policies or programs to plan for future combined heat and power or district energy systems.
Building Policies. Leading cities in building policies include Boston, Austin, Los Angeles, and New York City. These cities have adopted or advocated for stringent building energy codes, devoted resources to building code compliance, established requirements and incentives for efficient buildings, and increased the availability of information on energy use in buildings.
Energy and Water Utilities. The cities with leading energy utilities are Boston and Providence. The energy efficiency programs of the utilities serving these cities offer high levels of savings and reach underserved markets, including low-income and multifamily households. Austin, Boston, Columbus, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Diego are the leading cities in tackling efficiency in their water systems and water uses. Utility customers in these cities have access to efficiency programs designed to save water and energy simultaneously.
Transportation Policies. Cities with the top scores for transportation policies include Portland and New York City. Their initiatives include strategies to make their cities more compact and closer to transit options, shifts to efficient modes of transportation, transit investments, efficient vehicles and vehicle infrastructure, and energy-efficient freight transport.
Methodology
ACEEE’s 2017 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard includes the same 51 cities as it did in 2015. ACEEE researchers assessed the central city of each of the nation’s 50 most populous metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)—excluding San Juan, Puerto Rico—as well as El Paso and Fort Worth. The City Scorecard includes cities that have large populations within their borders (a median population of 632,309, with 124,006 in the smallest city) and are central cities in an MSA with a large population (a median of 2,384,075, and none smaller than 1,145,647). These cities alone make up 14.9% of the population of the United States.
Scoring is based on metrics that reflect the adoption and implementation by cities and utilities serving these cities of specific government policies, programs, and actions that can improve energy efficiency. The information in the Scorecard, and upon which ACEEE scored the 51 cities, reflects existing policies as of January 31, 2017. Although the policy environments in cities vary considerably, the report’s metrics capture a broad range of municipal actions.
EDITOR’S NOTE:  An electronic copy of the ACEEE 2017 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard report and a high-resolution image of the national map with the 51 cities highlighted, along with the ACEEE logo, will be available upon request. A streaming audio replay of the news event will be available at http://aceee.org/local-policy/city-scorecard as of 5:00 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, May 10, 2017.

Where does your city rank in the 2017 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard?;"Next week we will release the 2017 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard. Because it’s been two years since we published the last edition, here are some key scorecard numbers and facts to jog your memory about its contents.
100: Number of points cities could earn. No city came close to earning a perfect score in a past scorecard. Spoiler alert: it didn’t happen this time either.
51: Number of cities in the Scorecard. Combined, the metro regions of these cities account for more than half of the US population, and the cities alone make up nearly 15% of the US population. That’s a lot of energy consumers.
5: Number of policy areas that cover our 60+ metrics for assessing cities’ efficiency efforts. The activities we consider run the gamut from setting community-wide energy saving goals to creating sustainable transportation plans. They also include adopting, or advocating for state adoption, of stringent building energy codes.
32: Possibly the number of cities with improved scores in the report. Or perhaps the number of cities that lost points this time around. You’ll have to wait until next week to see which one is correct.
And #1: Thought we’d spill the beans? Not happening!
Check out our Scorecard landing page on May 10 shortly after 3:00 p.m. to find out who took the top spot and where your city landed in the rankings. You’ll be able to find the full report there, as well as a score sheet for each city and region.

Congress Takes Promising Step on Budget;"Statement by Maggie Molina, Senior  Director of Policy
We welcome the new congressional budget deal as a promising sign of bipartisan cooperation. The deal maintains funding for essential programs that work with the private sector to create jobs, spur economic growth, and transform energy waste into wealth.
It will continue essential work done by the Department of Energy (DOE), including these programs: Building Technologies Office, which has helped the average household save almost $500 a year in energy costs through appliance standards; Advanced Manufacturing Office, which develops new products and markets that boost the competitiveness of American businesses; Weatherization Assistance Program, which provides thousands of skilled construction jobs via home energy upgrades for low-income families; the State Energy Program, which supports efficiency programs within the states, with broad state discretion; the Vehicle Technologies Office, which develops fuel efficiency technologies and better batteries; and the Federal Energy Management Program, which saves taxpayer dollars by lowering the federal government’s energy bills.
The deal also avoids deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency. As a result, the popular ENERGY STAR® program that helps consumers pick efficient appliances is unlikely to see significant cuts this fiscal year.
We urge Congress to continue to include such funding for these programs as it begins consideration of the Fiscal Year 2018 budget later this month.

Coal is big. Solar’s bigger. But energy efficiency is the biggest.;"The New York Times recently reported that the solar industry now employs more people than the coal industry. It made the point well by featuring the accompanying graphic, based on Department of Energy data that track employment in various energy sectors:
This finding is interesting for a number of reasons, not least of which is the fact that the administration has been emphasizing its intention to revitalize the coal industry. If the number of people employed in a sector is the measure of how much attention it should receive, the implication of the Times piece is that solar should be getting more.
As big as the solar vs. coal story is, the Times missed the even bigger story. Because, while it’s true that the solar industry employs more people than coal, it’s also true that (as the below graphic shows) energy efficiency employs more people than both of them combined.
  The DOE numbers, derived from a methodology similar to the one used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for official employment reports, are the best estimates we have for part- and full-time employment in energy efficiency. As we noted in a prior post, such tracking is much trickier for efficiency than it is for traditional and alternative energy sectors, because energy efficiency is not a sector in the way that steel or auto manufacturing is. This makes it difficult to estimate energy efficiency employment, so we greatly appreciate DOE tracking these numbers so rigorously.
Solar power has always had a certain cachet to it: it’s often what comes to mind first when people think about emerging energy technology. But energy efficiency, doing more with less, has long been one of the largest, if largely invisible, sources of energy we have.
In that sense, there’s nothing new about how important the efficiency industry is, so the Times may not think it’s newsworthy. But if we are going to talk about how large the various energy industries are, it makes sense to include the largest one.

How big is the market for intelligent efficiency technology? You may be surprised;"Our new research reveals that sales of learning thermostats, a very popular form of intelligent efficiency, are expected to be three times as high this year as they were in 2013. This surge suggests broad future use of technologies that can save dramatic amounts of energy.
In recent years, ACEEE has explored the benefits of intelligent efficiency, our term for energy efficiency made possible by the responsive, adaptive, and predictive capabilities of information and communication technologies (ICT). These technologies can save energy by improving control and operation of systems, facilities, organizations, and even neighborhoods. Many products and services make up intelligent efficiency, producing savings in every sector of the economy. Yet very little quantitative information is available to help us understand its breadth and reach.
ACEEE’s new study documents the recent growth in use of intelligent efficiency across the US economy. It identifies how and how much ICT is being used to save energy. Our analysis focuses on four sectors of the economy – buildings, manufacturing, transportation, and government services – where intelligent efficiency applications are most common and are having the greatest impact on end-user energy consumption.
More than two dozen applications of intelligent efficiency with the potential to save significant amounts of energy have seen market acceptance. Each application has distinct features and benefits, and some applications are used in multiple sectors. What’s the potential impact of such overlap? Our analysis answers that question and quantifies market acceptance of each application with one or more indicators such as annual sales or product availability. 
For example, learning thermostats reduce energy use in residential buildings and are a key component of many utility-sector energy efficiency and demand-response programs. They also contribute to smart city benchmarking initiatives. In 2013, 2 million smart thermostats were sold, but this year that number is expected to triple. Sales in the larger product category of home energy management (HEM) is projected to increase from $273 million in 2013 to $1.8 billion in 2020. As the sales of these products increase, the share of homes with HEM products is expected to increase. In 2015, only 5% of homes had some type of HEM device, but the number is estimated to reach 19% by 2021.
Overall, we found a clear and steady rate of adoption of most applications, with some just shy of an inflection point that would indicate mainstream acceptance. Intelligent efficiency is an increasingly popular solution, and though it is not yet the next big thing in energy efficiency, there is every indication it will be soon.

New bill would treat PACE like a mortgage and take away consumer choice;"Residential Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs have been an unqualified success story for consumers’ pocketbooks and the economy, helping to finance almost $4 billion in clean energy upgrades and create tens of thousands of jobs. Despite this success, some in Congress are advancing a bill that would undercut the future of these programs.
In early April, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced legislation that aims to increase consumer protection for homeowners using PACE financing to upgrade their homes. ACEEE applauds Senator Cotton for his attempts to ensure that vulnerable consumers, particularly seniors, have the information they need to decide whether to use PACE financing.
We appreciate the good intentions behind S. 838. Unfortunately, instead of helping consumers make more informed choices, the bill could leave consumers unable to make any choice at all. The bill would force regulators to treat PACE financing as a mortgage, which it isn’t. Forcing PACE financing into a regulatory structure designed for a different industry would impose requirements that would be extremely difficult, or even impossible, to meet. The result might not be a safer residential PACE industry, but rather no residential PACE industry.
The bill seems innocuous enough: It would require that PACE financing be regulated under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).
It’s hard to oppose something that sounds as virtuous as “Truth in Lending,” and TILA is a very important safeguard for people who want to take out mortgages and borrow money in other ways. As its name suggests, TILA requires lenders to be clear in disclosing the details of the loans’ terms. It offers additional protections for mortgages, triggering added requirements for anyone engaged in making mortgage loans.
Requiring PACE programs to disclose financial terms and details the same way mortgages and other loans do is a great idea. Markets function best when both lender and borrower understand what they are getting into, and some of the additional protections that TILA gives mortgage borrowers make sense for the PACE industry as well. In particular, giving prospective borrowers three days to change their minds for any reason and without penalty seems like a common sense addition and is one that the PACE industry supports.
However, regulating PACE as though it were a mortgage goes much further and has broader consequences. The Cotton bill would trigger other state and federal regulations intended specifically for the mortgage industry. The combination of regulations would require PACE financers to be licensed mortgage originators, which also doesn’t sound like a bad idea, until you realize that residential PACE programs require local governments to participate. The local governments would have to become licensed mortgage originators, something that would be practically impossible. It would also place restrictions on how the local governments could bill PACE recipients, which would impact their entire property tax collection system. These and related problems demonstrate the perils of trying to apply a regulatory system meant for one industry to another. It would be a shame if well-intended efforts to protect consumers resulted in the elimination of residential PACE.
As we noted in a previous blog post, the Department of Energy, PACE financers, and consumer advocates have been working together to develop guidelines that protect borrowers and still allow PACE to function. California, which is home to the vast majority of PACE activity, recently passed its own legislation to regulate the PACE industry, including the same kind of disclosure requirements and three-day right to cancel as in TILA. That bill had the support of California Realtors, mortgage bankers, and the PACE industry. Leaders in the PACE industry are actively asking Congress to regulate them in a way that offers security for homeowners and allows PACE to continue.
ACEEE is a strong proponent of energy efficiency – when it makes sense. We won’t support a program that takes advantage of consumers. We support efficiency in large part because of the benefits it provides them. Consumers deserve protection, but that doesn’t mean we should throw the baby out with the bathwater.
Rather than pursue a strategy to shoehorn PACE into a regulatory framework meant for something else, a better approach would be to create a new structure that fits the specific features of PACE financing. That would bring security to both sides of the equation and help make the benefits of PACE available to more consumers, not fewer.

Western States Poised to Spring Forward on Energy Efficiency;"This spring, two western states are likely to decide on efforts that would yield dramatic energy savings, more jobs, and cleaner air. Legislators in Colorado and Nevada are weighing whether to improve and extend long-term energy efficiency targets.
Colorado’s energy efficiency targets have been in place since 2006 but are slated to expire in 2018. Last week the Colorado House passed a bill extending these savings goals for electric utilities through 2028.The Senate Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Energy Committee will likely take up the bill later this week. Since states with energy efficiency targets in place are saving substantially more energy than states without them, codifying a ten-year efficiency strategy would have big impacts. Passage would mean regulatory certainty for Colorado’s investor-owned utilities and long-term bill savings for residents and businesses.
In Nevada, legislators have introduced a flurry of energy efficiency and clean energy legislation. Among these is a bill (SB 150) that would direct the Nevada Public Utilities Commission to establish energy savings goals for utilities. This bill is a step in the right direction because, under current law, energy efficiency allowances will phase out of Nevada’s renewable energy portfolio standard in 2025, leaving utilities with little incentive to continue running efficiency programs. The current bill leaves a lot of the decision making up to the commission, so the fate of Nevada’s energy efficiency programs won’t be entirely determined by the state legislature. However, the bill would likely have big implications for utility-delivered energy efficiency since it would ask the commission to consider non-energy benefits like health and safety when evaluating cost effectiveness. The bill also would require utilities to direct at least 5% of total efficiency expenditures to low-income customers.
What would be the likely impact in Nevada? A recent report looked at several scenarios that would increase renewable energy and efficiency in the state. It found that strong policies would boost Nevada’s economy, drawing up to $3.3 billion in capital investments. Three large pieces of clean energy legislation in Nevada offer such policies: SB 150 (described above), a similar piece of efficiency legislation moving through the Assembly (AB 223), and a bill increasing the state’s renewable energy standard (AB 206).
All this legislative activity could mean good things for businesses and residents in Colorado and Nevada--not only energy bill savings but also local job opportunities, cleaner air, and improved comfort in homes and offices. We’ll be tracking these efforts and updating our Energy Efficiency Resource Standard Policy Brief and State Policy Database to reflect the long-term goals of Nevada and Colorado. We hope to see effective state policy blossom into meaningful energy savings this spring.

State regulators can play a critical role in unleashing building energy data;"The 21st century has ushered in a new era of measuring personal progress. With wearable technologies, we can now collect more personal data than we ever thought possible, from heart rate and step count to standing time and sleep quality. The ability to measure what we want to manage in real time has brought new meaning to the phrase “big data.” Improved tools for data collection and analysis have not been limited to health metrics. Technologies for collecting energy data in our homes and buildings have improved, producing more and better data than ever before. When companies and researchers have easy access to such data, they can examine energy consumption trends and opportunities to reduce energy waste. These insights lead to more energy-efficient technologies and behaviors and keep money in consumers’ pockets. To reap these savings, state regulators have an important role to play in expanding and guiding energy data access.
Through a new state policy toolkit piece and a convening of state regulators with the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), ACEEE is digging deeper into the connection between building energy data access and greater energy efficiency.
The benefits of energy data access
Access to energy data offers an array of benefits. Residents and multifamily building owners can use building energy data to pinpoint and prioritize potential energy efficiency projects. Businesses can use these data to develop new, automated, and increasingly user-friendly analytical tools to extract consumption insights. Utilities can use data to increase savings from energy efficiency programs and identify opportunities for future system upgrades. However, despite their increased availability, energy consumption data can still be difficult to work with and is not always accessible to building owners and tenants.
The role of statewide utility regulators
State regulators have begun to develop streamlined, statewide data access guidelines as a way to unleash these benefits, drive new energy business models, and ensure customer privacy. The Illinois Commerce Commission, for example, has issued guidelines on customer consent for third-party access to energy usage data, and advocates in North Carolina are pushing for data access legislation in 2017. State regulators often address data access in proceedings related to advanced metering infrastructure and grid modernization, but they can also open new proceedings to discuss issues about energy usage data. Within these proceedings, regulators can define major use cases, determine allowable third-party access, and address other process and enforcement-related considerations. In our new state policy toolkit piece, we describe these steps in greater detail and compile useful resources and state examples. This state-focused resource builds on an existing ACEEE local policy toolkit piece that explains the value of aggregated building energy data to individuals, households, and communities.
Quality AND Quantity
Providing customers with access to these data is the first step, but enabling customers to use these data is the essential second step. A fitness tracker that withholds a user's step count for three weeks isn't particularly helpful. Similarly, an energy management platform that provides slow feedback to users makes it harder to connect energy consumption behavior with its impact on utility bills. The frequency and granularity of building energy data – and the platform that provides these data – distinguishes actionable feedback from vague numbers. At ACEEE and IMT’s data access discussion in February, it became apparent that timely and appropriately detailed data can help commercial and multifamily building owners reduce energy costs. Eugenia Gregorio, Vice President of Strategy and Sustainability at The Tower Companies, noted that there is a healthy sense of competition among commercial real estate owners, so Tower’s brokers and leasing agents market their energy efficiency initiatives by connecting low building operating costs with potential increases to tenants’ bottom line. Trisha Miller, Chief Sustainability Officer at WISHROCK, said that utility costs are one of its few variable expenses and that it uses energy data to reduce energy costs and invest in other services for its low-income and working-class residents.
Looking forward
The value of building energy data will evolve as utilities, regulators, and businesses work together to deliver reliable and cost-effective energy services. By developing guidelines for energy data access, regulators can help utilities embrace innovation and better serve their customers.
To enrich our new data access toolkit piece, ACEEE will continue to explore best practices for statewide energy data access policies. We want to help you! Please reach out to Mary Shoemaker (mshoemaker@aceee.org) if you are interested in engaging or are in need of additional resources.

Maryland Renews Landmark Energy Efficiency Initiative;"Washington, D.C. —The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) today commended Maryland lawmakers for extending the successful EmPOWER Maryland energy efficiency program. Under the current plan, EmPOWER Maryland will save customers $4 billion on their utility bills, and once the program is extended, create an estimated 68,000 additional jobs in Maryland, according to reports published by ACEEE earlier this year.
With veto-proof majorities, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation (Senate Bill 185/House Bill 514) that extends EmPOWER Maryland until 2023 and sets new statewide targets for energy efficiency. Governor Larry Hogan this week allowed the legislation to become law without his signature.
“Extending EmPOWER Maryland is a big win for Maryland ratepayers and businesses,” said Brendon Baatz, utilities policy manager at ACEEE and coauthor of two studies on EmPOWER.  “EmPOWER Maryland means more electricity savings for consumers, reduced operating costs for employers, and increased jobs across the state. We commend the Maryland General Assembly for its bipartisan commitment to building an energy-efficient economy in Maryland. We now shift our focus to Maryland’s Public Service Commission, which must approve energy efficiency plans from Maryland’s five largest utilities in September.” 
EmPOWER Maryland, enacted in 2008, created energy efficiency programs that are offered through five electric utilities. The program helps homeowners and businesses save energy, partly by offering incentives and technical assistance for adding insulation, sealing air leaks, and installing more efficient appliances. It also facilitates efficient commercial lighting and other improvements at industrial facilities. Senate Bill 184 would extend EmPOWER Maryland until 2023.
Key Benefits of EmPOWER Maryland:
ACEEE concluded in two separate reports this year that EmPOWER Maryland will:
Produce more than $4 billion in total customer bill savings over the life of EmPOWER Maryland measures installed since 2008;
Generate $1.81 in benefits for every dollar spent on energy efficiency measures;
Create $3.75 billion in new gross domestic product;
Add 68,000 new Maryland jobs in manufacturing, construction, services, and other industries.

The study release in March can be viewed at http://aceee.org/white-paper/empowering-maryland-0317
Partly because of the EmPOWER Maryland program, Maryland now ranks as the ninth most energy-efficient state in the nation, according to ACEEE.

Leading states and utilities achieve substantial natural gas energy efficiency savings;"For the past several years, ACEEE has tracked utility-sector natural gas savings at the state level as part of our State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. As part of our biennial City Energy Efficiency Scorecard, we collect natural gas savings data at the utility level. These two data sources help identify the leaders in gas energy efficiency savings. The figure below shows the 14 states where utility-funded energy efficiency programs in 2015 saved more than 0.5% of retail natural gas sales (residential and commercial). This includes six states saving at least 1% of sales – Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Vermont.
Incremental 2015 Net Natural Gas Energy Efficiency Savings in Leading States as a Percent of Retail Natural Gas Sales
  Source: ACEEE’s 2016 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard.
The graph below summarizes energy efficiency savings as a percent of retail natural gas sales for 14 high-achieving natural gas utilities. These utilities each realized savings of more than 0.5% of sales.  Included are seven utilities with savings of at least 1% of sales, including four with savings of more than 1.5% of sales. These leading utilities show what can be achieved when utilities seek to maximize savings. Our data come from the forthcoming ACEEE 2017 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard, which includes data on the largest natural gas utilities serving the 51 largest cities in the United States. Of course, there are also high-achieving natural gas utilities that do not serve major cities. For example, some leading states in the first chart, such as New Hampshire and Vermont, are not represented in the second chart because they don’t have major cities. Also, there are often more than one utility serving customers in leading states, such as Eversource Massachusetts and Xcel Minnesota. These utilities are not included in the second chart. Thus, to get the full picture, one must consider both charts.

Energy efficiency budget cuts could exact hefty price on businesses, workers, rural residents, and low-income families;"The administration’s proposal to zero out funding for ENERGY STAR® has drawn a lot of buzz. While preserving ENERGY STAR is vital for energy efficiency in many ways, it’s only one among many important efficiency programs on the chopping block. The full budget has not been released yet, and Congress certainly won’t approve it in its current form, but House Republicans are eager to reduce funding for many of these programs. The threat of deep cuts is real.
Here are some of the other programs that could be gutted under the budget and who would be harmed by the cuts. Most of these cuts are proposed for 2018, but I also note some proposals for 2017.
Consumers: This ""skinny"" budget does not specify numbers for most energy efficiency programs but proposes massive cuts that will have to come from somewhere. It proposes that the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office (EERE) be cut by $516 million this year, about a quarter of its total budget with only half the year left. In 2018 the EERE, Electricity, Nuclear, and Fossil Energy offices would be cut by roughly $2 billion—about half of their combined budgets. That cut will likely be taken from programs like Building Technologies, which has helped the average consumer save almost $500 a year in energy costs through appliance standards and research. The program also helps homeowners understand their energy use with the Home Energy Score. WaterSense, a consumer information program similar to ENERGY STAR labels that addresses water use, is at the Environmental Protection Agency, which would be cut overall by 31%.
Businesses and workers: Along with Building Technologies, the Advanced Manufacturing and Vehicle Technologies programs (also subject to the overall EERE cuts) help American businesses reduce their energy costs and develop new products and markets, improving competitiveness and creating jobs. For example, the Industrial Assessment Centers train college students to do energy reviews for small and medium-size manufacturers, providing both workforce development and assistance in reducing costs.
The SuperTruck Program helps drive investment in developing fuel efficiency technologies for heavy trucks, keeping domestic manufacturers in the vanguard worldwide. DOE has been instrumental in sustaining the vehicle battery research and development effort that is now on the cusp of delivering batteries that will make plug-in vehicles competitive with gasoline-powered vehicles. SmartWay, an effective voluntary program to help freight companies reduce fuel use, could be subject to the overall EPA cuts.
Rural areas: Businesses and consumers in rural areas would be hit especially hard. The budget would cut the Department of Agriculture's Rural Development budget and zero out funding (other than what is mandated in the farm bill) for the Rural Business Cooperative Service, which provides financing for economic development, including energy efficiency, to rural small businesses. It would also eliminate the Treasury Department’s Community Development Financial Institutions grants, which help rural electric co-ops finance energy efficiency and other initiatives for their members.
Low-income families: DOE’s Weatherization Assistance Program provides more than 100,000 home energy upgrades for low-income families each year, helping them afford their energy bills, making their homes healthier, and providing thousands of skilled construction jobs. The budget would zero out this $215 million program. States allocate more money for weatherization out of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program ($307 million in 2014), which the budget would also eliminate.                                                                      
In addition, proposed cuts to the Department of Housing and Urban Development would hit energy-efficient affordable housing and increase cost burdens of families already struggling to make ends meet. The budget would end HOME Investment Partnerships program grants and Community Development Block Grants (after cutting the latter in half this year), two programs that help low-income families afford energy-efficient homes. Overall HUD funding would decrease by 13% or $6.2 billion.
States: The budget would end the State Energy Program (SEP), which provides critical support for state energy policy. SEP distributes $50 million in funding for energy offices in every state for energy efficiency,renewable energy, and energy emergency plans (yes, they would cut an emergency management program). This is the primary funding source for energy management in some state governments.
Infrastructure and commuters: The budget would immediately terminate Department of Transportation funding for public transit ""New Starts"" ($2.2 billion) and competitive TIGER grants for innovative transportation projects ($500 million), except for existing fully funded New Starts agreements. This would stop job-creating infrastructure projects, limit transportation options, and increase traffic for commuters, whose use of public transit has been growing.
Innovators: In addition to cuts in research programs at EERE, the budget would cut in half and then close down the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), which sponsors research to solve major clean energy challenges, such as new kinds of batteries, air conditioners, and metals processing.
Virtually every energy efficiency program in the federal government would likely be affected if this budget were enacted. I have not even touched on programs at the General Services Administration, Department of Defense, State Department, Small Business Administration, and others.
We are only at the start of the budget process. In April Congress must deal with the remainder of fiscal year 2017. Then the administration is expected to release a detailed budget proposal and Congress will begin considering appropriations bills for 2018. So far, the congressional reception for the budget has not been enthusiastic. Nonetheless, in this political environment, significant cuts are likely.
If you are concerned about possible cuts, please share your stories of what will be lost if this budget is enacted, and contact us about how you can help. My email is lungar@aceee.org.

The Clean Power Plan Will Leave a Lasting Legacy for Energy Efficiency;"Statement by Maggie Molina, Senior Director of Policy
Today’s executive order to begin a rollback of the Clean Power Plan does not halt the progress states have made in reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Across the country, states are relying on energy efficiency not only to meet greenhouse gas reduction goals but also to help families save money, meet energy demand reliably, create jobs, protect public health, and improve housing and infrastructure resiliency.
The Clean Power Plan created momentum for states to consider low-cost strategies to reduce emissions. It shined a spotlight on energy efficiency as a key compliance strategy to meet most – if not all – of states’ emission reduction goals. And it inspired state air regulators and utility regulators to coordinate in new ways and consider the impacts of energy efficiency programs on reducing emissions.
The Clean Power Plan was designed to reflect a direction in which states were already heading while encouraging them to do even more. Greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector have been steadily declining, and several states have doubled-down on efforts to reduce emissions in recent months. States have made substantial progress on energy efficiency, and cities are also setting aggressive energy efficiency targets often as part of their climate plans. Significant opportunity remains to save energy while avoiding harmful greenhouse gas emissions.
While the Trump administration chooses to move backward, states and local governments can choose to move forward with energy efficiency for its benefits to families, the economy, and the environment.

Energy efficiency and demand response can nearly level Southeast electricity demand for more than a decade;"Electricity markets in the Southeast are facing many changes on the customer side of the meter.  In a new report released today, we look at how energy efficiency, photovoltaics (solar electricity), electric vehicles, heat pumps, and demand response (shifting loads from periods of high demand) might affect electricity needs in the Southeast. We find that if all of these resources are pursued on an accelerated basis, electricity demand in the region can be stabilized until about 2030. After that, demand will likely grow in the following decade because of increased market penetration of electric vehicles and heat pumps, but energy planners will have time to deal with this growth if these projections are borne out. We also find that energy efficiency and demand response can be vital for managing electricity supply and demand in the region and that these resources can help contain energy demand growth, reducing the impact of expensive new generation on consumer wallets.
National trends
This is the second ACEEE report looking at regional electricity demand. In 2016, we published a study on electricity consumption in New England, finding an even more pronounced effect. For New England, with even more aggressive pursuit of energy efficiency and these other resources, consumption was projected to decline through about 2030, before rebounding in the following decade.
These regional trends fit into a broader national pattern. In the United States, electricity consumption has been essentially flat for the past decade. Increased energy efficiency efforts have contributed to this lack of consumption growth, even as the US economy has grown since the Great Recession. Recently, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA – a branch of the US Department of Energy) released data on US electricity consumption in 2016, finding that 2016 consumption was 0.3% below 2015 consumption (see table 5.1 here).
Five scenarios for the Southeast
ACEEE’s new study focuses on the Southeast because it is very different from New England, with warmer weather, more economic growth, and less-aggressive energy efficiency and distributed energy policies than the Northeast. For the Southeast, we examined five scenarios: a business-as-usual scenario; two alternative scenarios with progressively higher levels of energy efficiency, photovoltaics, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and demand response; and two scenarios combining high numbers of electric vehicles and heat pumps with more modest levels of the other resources. This figure presents electricity demand for each of these scenarios:
Over the 2016-2040 period, we project that average annual growth will range from 0.1% to 1.0%, depending on the scenario, much slower than historic growth in the region. Energy efficiency is generally the biggest contributor to changes in projected 2040 electricity consumption relative to the business-as-usual scenario, as shown in the figure below, which presents our accelerated scenario that is based on levels of energy efficiency and other resources now targeted by leading states and utilities in the Southeast.
To date, Entergy Arkansas has achieved the annual efficiency savings as a percent of sales shown in the accelerated scenario and Progress Energy (a division of Duke Energy) has nearly achieved those savings in both North and South Carolina. Sixteen states outside the Southeast have also achieved these savings statewide.
The efficiency savings shown in the aggressive scenario have been proposed by the Arkansas PSC. This level of savings has already been achieved by Arizona as well as six other states. Likewise, the demand response savings we model have been achieved by more than 10 utilities, including four in the Southeast. The levels of photovoltaic, electric vehicle, and heat pump penetration are more speculative and are subject to significant uncertainty.
We also examined trends in summer and winter peak demand. Most utilities in the Southeast have historically had peak demand in the summer, but our analysis shows that winter peaks will be more likely in the region as photovoltaics and demand response reduce summer peaks and heat pumps increase winter peaks.
Why it’s vital to plan broadly
Our analysis illustrates the importance of incorporating energy efficiency, demand response, and photovoltaics into utility planning forecasts. Failing to include these resources leads to much higher forecasts, resulting in excess utility system investments, unnecessarily increasing customer electricity rates. Our analysis also illustrates the importance of including electric vehicles and heat pumps in long-term forecasts. While these technologies will have moderate impacts over the next 10 years, they could become increasingly important in the long run.
We are entering a dynamic period of substantial uncertainty for long-term electricity sales and system peaks. We need to carefully observe and analyze developments in energy efficiency, photovoltaics, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and demand response over the next few years. As these technologies advance, we can create policies to reduce energy bills, system costs, and harmful emissions, while growing the Southeast’s economy. Resource planners should be sure to incorporate these emerging trends and policies into their long-term forecasts and planning.

Don’t Tread on ENERGY STAR;"In its recent budget outline, the new administration proposes to eliminate funding for the ENERGY STAR® program. An earlier leaked draft suggested that the private sector should take over the program and that a government role is not needed. Others have suggested that ACEEE should run the program. We strongly disagree.
ENERGY STAR is a huge return on investment
The ENERGY STAR program was started in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush and has received strong bipartisan support since its founding. ENERGY STAR is a voluntary program that typically recognizes the 25% most-efficient equipment and buildings. ENERGY STAR has about 90% consumer brand recognition. The program spurs the manufacturing and purchasing of ENERGY STAR certified equipment and buildings.
More than 16,000 ENERGY STAR retailers, manufacturers, contractors, and other businesses partner with the program. From the program’s inception through 2015, more than 5 billion certified products have been purchased in more than 70 product categories. Approximately 1.8 million ENERGY STAR certified new homes have been built, and owners of almost half the US commercial building space (450,000 buildings) have benchmarked the energy use of their buildings with ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager®. Families and businesses have saved more than $400 billion cumulatively since the program’s inception, saving $34 billion in 2015 alone. All this for a budget of about $50 million a year, enough to purchase about half of a new F-35 fighter jet.
The future of ENERGY STAR will be a highlight of our upcoming National Symposium on Market Transformation, so we hope you join us.
Should ENERGY STAR be spun off? No.
According to news reports, officials in the new administration have suggested that the private sector or an organization should take over the administration and funding of the ENERGY STAR program. There are multiple problems with this idea. First, ENERGY STAR is built on public recognition and trust. Whoever runs the program needs to be well recognized by the public and also perceived as non-biased. Most organizations and companies do not have this public recognition, and private companies or trade associations will probably not be perceived as unbiased.
Second, funds would need to be raised and staff or contractors hired. While $50 million is not much for the federal government, it is a lot for most organizations and for all but the largest companies. Furthermore, this is an annual budget, and sustaining this level of interest in the private sector for many years could be difficult. To raise these funds would likely require charging for use of the ENERGY STAR brand, and while some money could be raised, it is unclear if enough could be raised or if such fees would cause manufacturers and building owners to reduce their efforts to be certified under ENERGY STAR.
Third, there are liability issues. Whoever runs the program needs very good insurance and deep pockets, because firms whose products are not certified may sometimes sue. Most nonprofits would find the insurance costs prohibitive.
Finally, ENERGY STAR depends on technical work by other federal agencies. The test procedures are generally issued by the Department of Energy. The benchmarking of commercial buildings is compared to survey results from the Energy Information Administration. These programs are also threatened in the budget and could not readily be reproduced in the private sector.
To illustrate these problems, a recent Greentech Media podcast suggested that perhaps ACEEE could run the ENERGY STAR program. While we are flattered to be mentioned in this way, we do not have the public recognition that EPA does, the program budget is more than five times our total annual budget, and the liability exposure is too large for us. Other potential hosts would face similar circumstances.
Why mess with success?
The new administration regularly emphasizes helping Americans, creating jobs, and boosting economic growth. ENERGY STAR is a voluntary program that helps consumers and businesses across the country save billions of dollars. They invest that money in their businesses, homes, and other pursuits, employing people and helping the economy. ENERGY STAR has been very successful in its current form; why risk this success with dramatic changes that have a good chance of failing?

Why rate design matters for energy efficiency;"Today, most American households pay for electric service via a two-part electric rate. This typically consists of a small, fixed customer charge ($ per month) and an energy rate applied per unit of electricity ($ per kilowatt hour). There are some variations on this model, including energy rates that vary based on time of day or total monthly consumption, but the basic structure of residential rates hasn’t changed much over time. In recent years, utilities have proposed significant departures to this format to address the changing dynamics of the electric utility industry.
Some of these changes have the potential to disrupt the economics of customer efficiency investments and may drive customers to use more electricity. In our new report, Rate Design Matters: The Intersection of Residential Rate Design and Energy Efficiency, we examine the relationship between the changes in residential electric rates and customer engagement in energy efficiency.  
New Trends in Residential Rates
Under two-part rates, the first part is typically a monthly customer charge also known as a service fee or fixed charge. This charge collects costs associated with customer service, billing, and the meter and is typically less than $8 a month. The second part, known as the energy rate, collects the remaining costs to provide service via a volumetric rate per kWh. This rate has typically been flat, meaning the price does not vary by time of day or season. For some utilities, the flat energy charge evolved into tiered blocks, in which customers pay more or less for electricity as their consumption increases or decreases. The energy charge has also been collected in time-varying rates for some utilities, although customer participation for this option has historically been low.
Proposals from utilities in recent years are a departure from the simple two-part rate. Many proposals include higher customer charges, some as high as $70 a month. Most aren’t quite this high, but are still substantial. As shown in our new report, a review of 87 investor-owned utility rate cases from 2014 through January 2017 shows an average proposed increase of 61% (from $9.09 to $14.64), but an average approved increase of only 15%. While utilities are proposing much higher customer charges, the approved increases are lower than requested.
Other utility proposals include the implementation of demand charges for residential customers. Demand charges bill customers based on the maximum level of energy usage at one time during the billing cycle. This is known as peak demand and can be assessed in several ways. A demand charge would be billed in addition to the customer charge and energy rate. Only 20 utilities nationally offer demand charge options for residential customers. Proposals to implement mandatory demand charges for investor-owned utilities have been met with strong opposition, as was the case in Illinois and Arizona.
Customers Respond to Prices
Customers respond to prices for all goods and services. This is also the case with electricity. Ample evidence suggests that customers will conserve electricity when prices are high, and alternatively, use more electricity when prices are low. When prices are low and customers use more electricity, utilities will eventually need to make investments in the electric system to meet the increased demand, increasing costs for all customers on that system.
To better understand how some recent utility proposals to change rates might affect customer behavior, we reviewed several recent studies examining how customers respond to changes in rates. The evidence suggests that customers do respond to time-varying energy rates (prices that vary based on time of day and season), especially critical peak pricing and time-of-use rates. While peak demand reductions are a primary benefit of time-varying rates, we also found that customers generally reduced overall consumption. Of the 50 different time-varying pricing experiments we reviewed, the average peak demand reduction was 16% and the average reduction in overall consumption was 2.1%.
Rate Design Changes Affect Paybacks
We also considered how various iterations of revenue-neutral rate design could change the payback periods for energy efficiency measures. To do this, we reviewed usage data for an Arizona utility and relied on information from the Arizona Public Service Technical Resource Manual. We found that changes in rate design can dramatically alter payback periods for many measures. For example, the payback time in years for attic insulation increased by more than 30% when moving from a two-part rate to one with a $10 per kW demand charge.
Looking Ahead
Advances in technology, especially the implementation of advanced metering, allow utilities the opportunity to introduce time-based pricing options that better reflect system costs. While addressing concerns of revenue stabilization are important, high customer charges remove customer control of their bills, reduce the price signal to conserve electricity, and are not equitable to low-use customers. Time-varying rates, especially time-of-use rates and critical peak pricing, demonstrate benefits to customers and the utility system. There is little evidence related to how customers might respond to demand charges. Time-of-use rates are a better option if the objective of rate design is to communicate to customers via rates so they use electricity efficiently and understand their bills. They offer utilities an opportunity to recover the costs of providing service.

Trump’s Budget Proposal Will Raise Energy Bills and Kill Jobs;"The federal budget outline released by the Trump administration today takes a meat cleaver to energy efficiency programs, cutting both muscle and bone. If enacted, these cuts would raise Americans’ energy bills and kill jobs.
The proposed cuts would get rid of ENERGY STAR®, a popular, successful, and voluntary program that promotes energy-efficient equipment and buildings and saves consumers money. Also under the ax are research and development programs that keep US manufacturers competitive in global markets. The proposed budget eliminates the Weatherization Assistance Program, which reduces energy bills and increases the health and safety of low-income households across the country. It also cuts new public transit and other transportation funding that reduces traffic and gives people more options for commuting.
The fact is, these programs produce a huge windfall for all Americans—saving us billions of dollars in energy bills, making businesses more competitive, reducing air pollution, and creating millions of US jobs. The average American family saves at least $500 each year because of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) work on efficiency. ENERGY STAR helps Americans save more than $30 billion annually by providing information to choose energy-saving products. At least 2.2 million Americans work in ENERGY STAR-related jobs. DOE research in energy efficiency technologies is the foundation for small businesses across the country. And DOE has helped more than 7 million low-income families with energy upgrades to their homes. All of these gains could be lost under the president’s proposal.
Wasting energy and killing jobs are not the change Americans were seeking in the last election. We hope Congress will continue to help Americans save money and will reject cuts that would harm the economy, the environment, and their pocketbooks.

Trump’s Move on Vehicle Standards Risks Billions in Savings at the Pump;"Statement of Therese Langer, ACEEE Transportation Program Director
Today’s announcement of backtracking on vehicle standards for model years 2022-2025 puts at risk tens of billions of dollars of fuel savings for consumers and big reductions in tailpipe emissions.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s January determination that the standards remain feasible and cost effective, even in the face of lower projected gasoline prices, followed a comprehensive technical review released last July. That review also documented the health benefits the standards would deliver through cleaner air.
Automakers pushed the administration toward today’s announcement, but they are doing their own industry a disservice. Any delay in settling efficiency standards introduces uncertainty that will disrupt manufacturers’ product planning. What is certain is that technological stagnation is not a recipe for continuing the remarkable success our domestic manufacturers have achieved in recent years.
In an intensely competitive global vehicle market that is heading towards highly efficient, low emissions vehicles, US manufacturers need to keep moving forward. And consumers deserve vehicle options that save fuel and limit exposure to high gasoline costs in the future. Keeping the 2025 standards in place is the best way to advance both of those objectives.

EmPOWER Maryland Will Create 68,000 New Jobs and Boost GDP in Maryland;"Washington, DC—Maryland could gain more than 68,000 new jobs and $3.75 billion in new gross domestic product as a result of investments to be made over the next 10 years through the EmPOWER Maryland energy efficiency program, according to a new study from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). The study comes as the Maryland General Assembly debates bipartisan legislation to extend EmPOWER Maryland and establish new statewide energy efficiency goals.
EmPOWER Maryland, enacted in 2008, helps homeowners and businesses save energy by offering incentives and technical assistance for adding insulation, sealing air leaks, and installing more-efficient appliances. The program is administered by Maryland’s five largest electric utilities and also facilitates efficient commercial lighting as well as other improvements at industrial facilities.
ACEEE’s study reveals that the program’s projected investments between 2017 and 2026 will:
Create more than 68,000 new jobs in Maryland, with the highest concentration occurring in construction and services sectors
Add approximately $3.75 billion to the state’s gross domestic product
Reduce electricity consumption by more than 130 billion kilowatt hours
Generate $11.7 billion in energy savings for Maryland families and businesses
The full study can be viewed at: http://aceee.org/white-paper/empowering-maryland-0317
The Maryland General Assembly is considering legislation to require a 2% reduction in energy consumption from the state’s five largest electric utilities. The Maryland House of Delegates passed the legislation last week, 92-46, with bipartisan support. The Maryland Senate is expected to vote on the legislation this week, which could encourage energy efficiency efforts such as the EmPOWER program.
“Our research finds that EmPOWER Maryland produces both good-paying jobs and customer savings on electric bills,” said Brendon Baatz, study co-author and utilities policy manager at ACEEE. “Investing in smarter energy usage means more disposable income for consumers, lower operating costs for businesses, and increased jobs in construction, manufacturing, and other industries. Maryland lawmakers can say with confidence that a vote for EmPOWER Maryland is a vote for a stronger economy.”
A study released by ACEEE in January found that energy efficiency measures already installed because of EmPOWER Maryland will result in $4 billion in total cost savings for Marylanders.
The first phase of EmPOWER Maryland aimed to reduce per capita electricity usage by 10% and peak electricity demand by 15% by 2015. The Maryland Public Service Commission concluded in 2015 that state utilities achieved 99% of the per capita consumption goal and 100% of the per capita demand reduction goal.
ACEEE’s analysis focuses on the next phase of the EmPOWER Maryland program, which would include the 2% energy reduction goal. ACEEE’s study notes that the job creation would be spread across the economy, with significant gains in construction and related sectors over the next few years. Construction sector employment remains more than 15% below its pre-2009 levels.
Partly because of the EmPOWER Maryland program, Maryland now ranks as the ninth most energy-efficient state in the nation, according to ACEEE.

Vehicle standards are energy efficiency at its best – and too valuable to roll back;"The Trump administration is reportedly launching a rollback of vehicle efficiency standards that greatly benefit the US economy. These standards save consumers money, create jobs, help reduce US reliance on foreign oil, and lower carbon emissions. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas emissions standards adopted since 2009 will reduce fuel consumption by more than 2 million barrels of oil per day by 2025 (the equivalent of taking 53 million cars off the road) and will eliminate 6 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions over the lifetimes of vehicles of model years 2012-2025. Consumers will save over $1 trillion at the gas pump, which is more than three times the added cost of the more efficient vehicles. The energy savings compare favorably to any other efficiency policy out there: an ACEEE analysis of primary energy savings from recent and prospective policies—including the Clean Power Plan—showed vehicle standards to be the biggest saver from today through 2040.
Benefits of the program extend beyond savings for new car buyers. At the time the standards for model years 2017-2025 were proposed in 2011, ACEEE projected they would create 50,000 jobs in the auto sector by 2030 because of the additional components and labor needed to develop and produce more-efficient cars. Moreover, there would be a net gain of 570,000 jobs economy-wide by 2030. This gain represents new auto industry jobs as well as jobs created in all sectors because of car buyers’ spending of added disposable income from owning more-efficient vehicles. It takes into account jobs lost in oil-related sectors because of reduced demand for fuel.
So what’s not to like?
Automakers are decrying a decision made by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in January, as part of a mandatory review, that reaffirms existing greenhouse gas emissions standards for model years 2022 through 2025. They argue that the decision ignores vehicle affordability and consumer acceptance of new technologies. But this claim is based on the notion that EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which sets CAFE standards, underestimated the need for plug-in vehicles and full hybrids to achieve the standards. At present, these advanced vehicles represent a substantially costlier pathway to improve fuel economy on a dollar-per-gallon-saved basis than incremental improvements to conventional technologies, especially when fuel prices are low.
The agencies have presented detailed technology scenarios that would allow manufacturers to meet the standards, and the role of plug-ins and full hybrids in those scenarios is very small. EPA’s review found that the standards could be met at a lower cost than it projected when the standards were adopted in 2010 primarily because of the emergence of additional, lower-cost technologies than those relied upon in the original compliance demonstration. This replenishment of the supply of affordable efficiency technologies is a phenomenon familiar to those who have followed energy efficiency advances in any sector, and it is one reason that meeting efficiency standards tends to cost less than predicted.  
Similarly, recent claims that the standards would result in heavy losses in auto industry jobs are based on a woefully flawed analysis that ignores technological and economic realities. The specific assumptions underlying ACEEE’s earlier estimates of job gains will inevitably differ somewhat from how things unfold—and in particular gasoline price projections have come down since then—but the impressive growth of the auto industry during the recent years of brisk advances in fuel efficiency technology is certainly consistent with the fundamentals of our analysis.
While manufacturer posturing on vehicle standards is much in the news, it’s important to bear in mind that the timeline for these historic increases in fuel economy standards was designed to accommodate the industry’s requests for long lead time and regulatory stability. The CEO of parts supplier Borg-Warner, James Verrier, recently made this plea: “Do not slow down the pace on CAFE standards. We’ve come a long way as an industry, and we need to keep going forward.”
The long-term future of the global auto industry is in high-efficiency vehicles, due to the likelihood of higher future oil prices and a worldwide push to reduce vehicle emissions. To be competitive, US manufacturers will need to keep improving the fuel economy of their cars and trucks. In fact, fuel economy standards in Europe and Asia are generally more stringent than US standards. Let’s not be enablers of our domestic manufacturers’ tendency to shoot themselves in the foot by ignoring where the industry is headed. We should stay the course on vehicle standards already in place and start looking beyond 2025.

What the Wall Street Journal got wrong about PACE;"The meteoric rise of Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing over the past few years has been surprising even to those working in clean energy finance. Since its inception in 2009, PACE has enabled $3.3 billion in renewable and energy efficiency investments in people’s homes, $2.8 billion of which occurred in 2016 alone.
The growth of the PACE market has been so remarkable that it’s getting attention outside of the efficiency world as well as inside it. The Wall Street Journal recently published an article calling PACE the “fastest growing loan category.” But in the same article, it ominously compared PACE to the subprime mortgage crisis. If true, this would certainly merit even more attention, this time from regulators and possibly even law enforcement. Fortunately, it’s not.
The pros and cons of PACE
PACE financing smooths out the up-front costs of clean energy investments by paying them out of a capital fund that gets repaid through property taxes. Homeowners and commercial building owners agree to a voluntary tax assessment, and the local government collects the payments on the property tax bill and pays back the PACE financer. The tax assessment offers PACE financers security, which allows them to offer lower rates in return. When it works well, everybody wins.
Although PACE appears to be working well, the tax assessment—PACE’s central feature— makes some people nervous. When homes go into foreclosure, property taxes get paid before mortgages. Since a PACE assessment is part of property taxes, mortgage lenders are concerned that it would leave less money to pay them back in a foreclosure. And since a state or county can force a home into foreclosure if owners don’t pay their taxes, lenders are worried that if someone doesn’t make their PACE payments, the property will go into foreclosure even if the mortgage is up to date.
Dealing with insurers’ concerns
Any time foreclosure enters the conversation, it’s important to be extra careful, because the stakes are high for homeowners. While the Federal Housing Administration (which insures about 17% of the residential mortgage market) is fine insuring homes with PACE assessments on the property, so far at least, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (which own or insure 60% of the mortgage market) aren’t.
None of this is lost on other parts of the federal government, the PACE industry, consumer advocates and others. It’s why the Department of Energy has led an effort to bring all of these interests together to develop a set of best practices for the industry. The DOE released the results of that effort in November. The PACE industry has already agreed to subordinate their assessments to primary mortgage loans so that mortgages get paid first in a foreclosure, and the DOE guidelines set out a suite of consumer protection measures for the industry to follow to help ensure that homeowners are treated fairly.
On top of this, in an investment note released this month, the investment research group Morningstar found that PACE assessments pose “no material risk” to mortgages on the properties in question.
Tempest in a Teapot
That brings us back to the story in the Wall Street Journal. The idea that PACE loans could be building towards something like the subprime crisis is simply wrong. First and foremost, the subprime crisis was a crisis because bad and sometimes unethical business practices got people in over their heads with loans that were too large and payments too high for them to afford. It forced tens of thousands of properties into foreclosure every month. People lost their homes.
To date, not a single home has been put into foreclosure because of unpaid PACE assessments. And less than 1% of homes with PACE assessments have gone into foreclosure for any other reason, a lower rate than the market average. There is not even a shadow of the subprime crisis to be seen.
At the same time, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) is also unhappy with PACE. In a recent statement, it called for PACE financing to be reclassified as a mortgage or at least be subject to the same lending requirements as mortgages. The principal issue seems to be that while mortgages are made by mortgage bankers, PACE financing is arranged by home improvement contractors working with PACE financers and local government.
But this points to the reason why PACE assessments should not be treated as mortgages. They are basically home improvement loans. In January, the average mortgage application was $309,000. PACE assessments average closer to $20,000. It’s not a trivial amount of money, but PACE assessments just can’t impose the same kind of financial burden that a bad mortgage can, and the PACE industry is voluntarily adopting more stringent standards than traditional home improvement loans.
The Wall Street Journal was able to find two PACE customers who say they were taken advantage of by unscrupulous contractors. It’s unfortunate that unethical people appear ready to use whatever vehicle they can to defraud people. Like mortgage lenders, the PACE industry would like those people out of its market. But, despite its protections, this industry is likely to see some future stories of bad behavior—as will the mortgage market, which brought us the subprime crisis in the first place
The Larger Story
PACE financing has delivered billions of dollars in clean energy investments for homeowners, creating tens of thousands of jobs and saving hundreds of millions in reduced energy costs.
As a financial vehicle, PACE is performing remarkably well. The great majority of PACE homeowners are making payments on time. There is no evidence of the widespread fraud and economic disaster that mortgage markets saw in the runup to the subprime crisis. Calls to regulate PACE as if there were such evidence seem premature at best.

Should utility prepay plans be considered energy efficiency programs?;"Utility proposals for customer prepayment plans are on the rise. These payment plans require customers to pay in advance for their utility services and, if they run out of prepaid credit, they are remotely disconnected from service until they top up their credit. While utilities can benefit from these plans because of reduced financial risks from overdue payments and other reduced service costs, many consumer advocates are concerned about these plans’ effects on health and safety, particularly for low-income participants.
Some utilities and prepay advocates claim that prepayment influences customers to save energy. If this is true, should prepay plans be considered energy efficiency programs? To answer this question, there are a few key questions that we need to ask. What portion of the observed usage reductions result from energy efficiency improvements such as structural building and equipment upgrades, or from energy waste reduction through positive behavioral changes? And what proportion result from behavioral curtailment that cause discomfort, deprivation, and (or) full shut-offs? And how long do these energy savings last? It’s important to keep in mind that a central tenet of energy efficiency is the notion that customers do not have to sacrifice comfort or level of service to save energy.
In this blog post, we will discuss recent prepay developments and questions we have regarding prepay as energy efficiency, and we will tee up some areas for further research.
Recent trends and key questions about energy savings claims
Currently, electric utilities in at least 34 states offer some version of a prepay payment plan, with the highest number occurring in the Southeast. Cooperatives and municipal utilities offer most of them, and these utilities usually don’t have regulatory oversight by a public commission. This payment option is often targeted to low-income customers to ensure fewer missed bill payments and reduced costs of energy shut-offs. Proponents of prepay plans suggest that this payment option not only reduces costs and financial risks for the utility but also saves customers money on their energy bills. According to E Source, seven utilities have noted energy savings associated with prepay plans of 5% to 14%. However only a few of these savings claims are supported by full evaluation studies. Also, this level of savings is higher than the roughly 2% to 7% energy savings ACEEE has found with most opt-in behavior change programs.
Some evaluations exist, but also key questions remain
At this time, we are aware of only a few evaluation studies that quantify energy savings from prepay plans,, some of which combine education and feedback elements. We know of only two utilities that are allowed by regulators to count savings toward energy efficiency targets: Arizona Public Service (APS) and Salt River Project (SRP), both in Arizona. It’s worth noting some recent prepay developments for both APS and SRP.
APS is undergoing billing system changes that precluded the expansion of the program, which ended in 2016, beyond the pilot phase. The Arizona Corporation Commission has ordered APS to work with stakeholders to enhance the education and communication offerings for potential future prepay plans to increase their effectiveness.
SRP is continuing their M-Power program, which includes a prepay tariff, an in-home display device, and customer education. SRP’s 2016 energy efficiency plan relies on the M-Power program, including the prepay plan, to account for 67% of energy savings in the residential sector and 52% of total portfolio savings. That level of reliance on a single program for energy efficiency savings raises significant questions. To what extent are the energy savings the result of energy efficiency as compared to changes in usage due to disconnection and (or) deprivation? To what extent might energy savings be accounted for by paying in advance as opposed to receiving feedback or education? And how long might these savings last? Some key parties involved in these cases hypothesize that most of the reductions in energy use observed in the SRP M-Power program are due to energy efficiency information and the in-home display unit provided to participants, and do not simply result from the prepay tariff. This uncertainty is one reason that we need more research on prepay plans.
Many groups are concerned about consumer protections
Aside from the question of energy savings, some consumer advocates are concerned about customer deprivation (i.e., being deprived of the necessary amount of energy for a safe living environment) as a consequence of prepay plans and also about health and safety risks, burdensome transaction fees, and increased risk of shut-offs for low-income and vulnerable customers. There has been some research on the number of disconnections under a prepay plan. For example, a 2015 study of the APS prepaid service plan found that 93% of sampled participants experienced at least one disconnection event over a 13-month period. In the same study, analysis of a smaller group of participants demonstrated that over the same period, 30% experienced at least five disconnections, with most occurring during the peak hot weather months.
Consumer advocates have created consumer protection guidelines for state adoption of prepayment plans. For example, the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC), which opposes prepay service, provides several recommendations to states in regards to prepay plan requirements and protections if states decide to move forward with prepay rates. Additionally, the National Association of Utility Consumer Advocates (NASUCA) passed a resolution, “Urging States to Require Consumer Protections as a Condition for Approval of Prepaid Residential Gas and Electric Service,” which advocates for rules on who can participate in prepay plans and how they should be protected once enrolled.
Prepayment plans have clearly raised many serious concerns about consumer protections and access to energy service, with some policymakers and regulators choosing to reject prepay plan proposals. For example, in November 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) rejected a proposal from San Diego Gas and Electric for a prepay plan, citing concerns that the proposed plan would induce customers to forgo essential consumer protections and that some would not receive secure notification of impending disconnection. In 2009, Massachusetts dismissed a utility proposal, stating that the plan would have unfairly targeted low-income customers.
So should prepay plans be considered energy efficiency programs?
The short answer is not yet, at least not until more research is conducted. Discussions about the suitability of prepay plans as energy efficiency programs—particularly when targeted to low-income customers—are growing louder and more numerous, and we see a strong need for additional data and rigorous evaluations to help understand the impacts of prepay plans on energy consumption. Stakeholders need high-quality data and evaluations on three key questions to inform regulatory decisions.
If customers on prepay plans reduce their energy consumption, what actions are they taking to do so? What proportion of these savings or changes in usage can we attribute to each of the following: (1) energy efficiency retrofits (i.e., physical measures and upgrades), (2) education and behavior change leading to less wasted energy, (3) curtailment behavior to the point of reduced comfort, and (4) complete energy shut-offs due to missed payments?   
To the extent that prepay plans lead to changes in usage that we would consider beneficial energy savings (i.e., categories (1) and (2) above), what components of the plans drive these savings? Available evaluations also suggest that prepay plans have been effective at reducing energy consumption when they include customer education and near-real-time feedback components such as in-home displays or text messages. Given that we know education and feedback strategies can reduce energy consumption, we are interested in determining if, and in what ways, the fact of paying in advance for electricity influences customer behavior.
How do we best ensure that prepay customers receive quality energy efficiency services? Are prepay plan participants also offered access to weatherization and other energy efficiency services that can lead to long-term improvements in health, comfort, and energy affordability? Utilities should market these energy efficiency programs to customers who enroll in prepay plans to ensure they save the most possible energy.  
Meanwhile, ACEEE believes that any prepayment plans that are included in efficiency portfolios should be combined with energy efficiency components to help customers reduce their bills. These components should include energy efficiency information and behavioral feedback at a minimum, but potentially also targeted energy efficiency materials and services. To date, it is largely unknown whether existing prepayment plans specifically include the provision of these energy efficiency components.
It is important to note that if utilities and regulators are looking for ways to help their customers save energy and help meet long-term energy efficiency targets, there are many other options. For examples, see ACEEE research reports on next-generation utility programs and expanding program participation. Another ACEEE report expands on best practice programs for low-income customers. And see our new research report for behavioral program ideas. Like customers with certain prepayment arrangements, customers enrolled in behavioral programs can receive frequent (e.g., daily or high-usage) feedback through email, text, or phone alerts as a way to motivate energy-saving habits.
ACEEE intends to explore the above questions in greater depth based on robust research into prepay plans and their relationship to energy savings. We are currently seeking other organizations to partner with or to financially support this research.

Buildings smarten up, think about occupants, utility rates and the weather;"Ever wonder what a building thinks about its climate or the occupants it serves? Or, conversely, how the occupants perceive their building? Buildings are becoming increasingly smart; they are becoming more aware of their environment and responsive to our needs. In our new report, we discuss how smart buildings respond to, and even anticipate, changes in operation to meet energy demand and occupant expectations. Our research focuses on existing US commercial buildings of different sizes and types. We explain how building energy efficiency and performance can improve with smart technologies and through interconnected building systems. Why is this important? A fully-integrated building can use 30% less energy than a building with systems operating independently.
Buildings no longer need to operate as islands. Smart buildings use information and communication technologies to optimize operations and connect to the wider community and the power grid. They enhance occupant comfort and productivity while conserving energy by employing advanced controls, networked sensors, and energy analytics software. By working together, these technologies can reduce common ways we consume energy in buildings. Here are four examples of smart technologies discussed in our paper:
The energy information system (EIS) is the central nervous system of a smart building. It makes anticipatory changes in building operations based on external factors such as occupancy patterns, weather forecasts, and utility rates. By collecting and analyzing building performance data in real time, an EIS can immediately detect spikes in energy usage and identify defective equipment. These systems can save up to 10% in whole building energy use and are cloud-based, allowing the building to be remotely monitored by staff or third-party vendors.
Smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems use multiple sensors throughout the building to improve air quality and thermal comfort. Smart HVAC controls can limit energy consumption in unoccupied zones, detect and diagnose faults, and reduce HVAC energy usage, particularly during times of peak demand. Smart HVAC controls can reduce HVAC energy use as much as 24% in hotels and cut approximately 40% of total energy use in laboratories.
Smart lighting systems employ highly-efficient luminaires with autonomous controls, such as continuous dimming and daylighting, to provide better quality space lighting. Advanced controls alone can reduce lighting energy use by 45%. Smart lighting is controlled wirelessly and through web-based dashboards, and can even empower occupants to control the lighting in their workspaces.
Smart plugs and power strips target appliances and equipment that are plugged into outlets and continue to draw power when not in use. They completely cut off power to these devices and can be programmed to operate with lighting and HVAC schedules. Reductions in energy use from plug loads range from 25% for workstations and up to 50% for kitchens and printing rooms.
Beyond energy savings
As opportunities for energy savings widen with smart buildings, so do nonenergy benefits. Occupants are increasingly demanding flexible, controllable workspaces and some building owners are installing smart technologies to attract and retain tenants. Also, worker productivity has been shown to increase as a result of improved indoor air quality, more comfortable temperatures, and enhanced access to daylighting. Barriers to smart technologies include high upfront purchase costs, gaps in workforce skill sets, and interoperability and cyber security concerns.
Programs are becoming smarter too
Energy efficiency programs are evolving to meet the emergence of smart buildings. Program designs and incentives suitable to smart commercial building retrofits aim to increase energy savings at the system level or whole building. Some incentives are widget based while others ensure efficiency performance for the life of the project. Programs can now incentivize ongoing commissioning and real-time Evaluation, Measurement, and Verification (EM&V). Smart buildings participate in demand response programs and can connect distributed generation and storage to the grid.
Want to know more? Read our report on this exciting and emerging topic. Our report provides a broad look at the state of smart technologies in commercial building retrofits and their energy savings potential. To expand on this research, we are conducting a follow-up study in 2017 that will focus on key market segments. Through a deeper dive, we plan to identify which smart technologies and applications yield the greatest energy savings and are most cost-effective.

Multifamily energy efficiency spending nearly triples in four years;"Today, one in six American households resides in the apartments or condominiums of multifamily buildings. While new multifamily buildings are being constructed across the country, most residents still live in older buildings that are not energy-efficient. ACEEE’s newly released report provides encouraging news for apartment and condo dwellers who want to reduce the cost of their energy bills. Utility-sector energy efficiency programs that serve these buildings have nearly tripled their spending in recent years. While these programs still face challenges, many are expanding the products and services they offer to upgrade buildings.
Addressing the Challenge of Retrofitting America’s Multifamily Buildings
Historically, energy efficiency programs have not sufficiently served the multifamily sector. As ACEEE identified in a report last year, it can be difficult to effectively market efficiency programs to the owners and managers of multifamily buildings, who face many competing priorities for their time and resources. They may find it difficult to navigate an efficiency program’s application process or obtain financing for upgrades. Program managers have also struggled to convey the total benefits of efficiency upgrades, which can include not only energy savings but also reduced operation and maintenance costs, improved tenant satisfaction, and healthier indoor environments.
Multifamily Energy Efficiency is Improving
ACEEE’s new report More Savings for More Residents: Progress in Multifamily Housing Energy Efficiency, examines energy efficiency programs serving the 51 metro areas with the most multifamily households. It documents those programs that have successfully tackled the above challenges and expanded their capacity to serve the multifamily market. In 2015, these programs spent $291 million in the nation’s largest multifamily markets to provide incentives and no-cost measures that upgrade apartment and condo buildings. This level of spending is nearly triple the spending that ACEEE estimated in its 2013 report, Scaling Up Multifamily Energy Efficiency Programs: A Metropolitan Area Assessment. Not only has spending increased, but it also occupies a greater share of many utility-sector energy efficiency budgets as seen on the map below.
Today, multifamily programs are available in 38 of the nation’s 51 largest markets – an increase of eight markets since ACEEE’s 2013 assessment. Most of these programs offer both the direct installation of no-cost efficiency measures and financial incentives for building upgrades. The number of markets offering programs to retrofit entire buildings and building systems – programs that achieve the greatest energy savings – has also increased. Comprehensive retrofit programs only served 16 markets when ACEEE conducted its initial assessment of multifamily programs, but today these programs serve 25 markets.
What is Driving Multifamily Program Expansion
State-level policy, regulation, and funding are the primary drivers of utility energy efficiency investments – including those made in multifamily buildings. As ACEEE’s State Energy Efficiency Scorecard documents, many states have recognized a need to increase energy efficiency spending and adopt policies that encourage the creation and expansion of efficiency programs.
Many local governments have adopted energy benchmarking policies requiring that multifamily owners track their buildings’ energy use and report how it compares with similar local buildings. These policies have helped building owners identify the need for energy efficiency investments and, in some municipalities, required owners to upgrade their buildings.
Through its Multifamily Energy Savings Project, ACEEE continues to work with utilities, community organizations, and government agencies to create new multifamily programs while improving and expanding others. Our ongoing work includes researching program best practices, offering technical assistance to utilities, and facilitating an ongoing working group for program administrators.
Remaining Challenges
While multifamily programs are more common now than several years ago, challenges remain for this sector. Multifamily energy efficiency spending across the 51 largest markets only accounts for an average of 6% of total efficiency spending. By way of comparison, sales of electricity and natural gas to multifamily properties comprised 11% of all sales in 2009. Many metro areas still lack comprehensive building retrofits programs. Thirteen large metro areas have no multifamily programs at all.
Low-income multifamily buildings are particularly underserved. Low-income families often struggle to find homes that have both affordable rents and energy costs. There are currently only 15 metro areas that have programs targeting multifamily buildings with low-income renters. ACEEE, along with partners such as Energy Efficiency for All, are working to increase the number of programs serving these households. ACEEE is conducting a multi-year low-income research initiative focused on documenting program best practices and opportunities for improvement and expansion.

Report: HI, CT, MA, RI, and AK Households Save Most on Overall Utility Bills due to Appliance Standards;"ASAP/ACEEE Analysis Ranks All 50 States and DC on Electricity, Gas & Water Bill Savings; NH, NY, VT, CA, and NJ Round Out Top 10 States Where Consumers Save Most Money.
Washington, DC—The average American family saved nearly $500 on utility bills in 2015 as a direct result of existing efficiency standards for appliances and lighting, according to a new report issued today by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). The report details average household savings for all 50 states and the nation’s capital in four categories:  household utility bill savings; electricity savings; natural gas and oil savings; and water savings. The top 10 states for each are ranked. Consumers in Hawaii save the most on overall household utility bills — a whopping $945.
Appliance standards protect consumers and save them money by eliminating energy- and water-wasting products in the market, while preserving the performance and features consumers value and encouraging manufacturers to develop and bring to market products with improved efficiency performance.
Available online at http://www.appliance-standards.org/documents/reports/white-paper-overview, the new ASAP/ACEEE report updates previous estimates of the consumer and business benefits achieved by all existing national standards. In addition to the consumer savings, ASAP/ACEEE show big benefits for businesses too. Total business utility bill savings from standards reached nearly $23 billion in 2015. Business energy bill savings equaled 8% of total business spending on electricity and natural gas.
Average household savings by state ranged from 11-27% of total consumer utility bills, with a national average savings of 16%. The top 10 states for household utility bill savings from existing appliance standards are: 
Consumers in states with highest bill savings save the most, because they tend to pay the most for energy. Other factors affecting savings include the types of appliances consumers have (e.g. electric versus gas water heaters), and how much cooling and heating they use and household size. States appearing at the bottom of the overall utility bill savings list include: Washington (50), North Dakota (49), Idaho (48), Montana (47), West Virginia (46), Wyoming (45), Oregon (44), Nebraska (43), Arkansas (42) and Louisiana (41). Savings in 2015 for the bottom ten states were still significant, ranging from $360-$405.
ASAP Executive Director Andrew deLaski said:  “Appliance efficiency standards are a win for Americans in every single state. There are no ‘losers’ when it comes to household savings from appliance standards.”
Commenting on the ASAP/ACEEE report, Charlie Harak, senior attorney for energy and utilities issues, National Consumer Law Center, said: ""Appliance standards save low-income households money, leaving them more to buy food and pay the rent. They disproportionately are renters, not homeowners, and move into housing where the owner purchases major energy-consuming appliances like furnaces. Standards ensure that low-income renters aren't saddled with inefficient appliances that are energy hogs."" 
Tom Eckman, senior advisor and former Director of Power Planning, Northwest Power and Conservation Council, said: “Appliance standards have produced a virtual trifecta of benefits across the Northwest. By significantly slowing the growth in electricity demand across the Northwest, they’ve reduced the need to build expensive new power plants, kept regional power costs lower and produced significant consumer bill savings.”
ACEEE Executive Director Steven Nadel said: “Appliance standards are good for the US economy, benefitting both consumers and businesses. They generate savings that create more jobs.”
The top 10 states for per household electricity savings span the Southeast plus Texas and Arizona. These tend to be the states with the greatest air conditioner use and where electric water heating is most common.  The top 10 states are as follows:
The top 10 states for per-household gas and heating oil savings are those with the largest heating needs (which is where gas and oil heating is most common) and where gas water heating is prevalent. They are as follows:
In addition to the state-by-state data on overall utility bill as well as electricity and gas/heating oil savings, the new ASAP/ACEEE report provides detailed information on water savings at the national level and for all 50 states and Washington, DC. At a national level, water savings in 2015 reached 1.5 trillion gallons, enough to meet the needs of all the households in Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, and Colorado combined. The top 10 states for household water savings from existing appliance standards in order are: 
ASAP’s deLaski added:  “Appliance standards work to boost local economies by putting savings in consumers’ and business owners’ pockets. Money saved on utility bills gets plowed back into the economy, creating jobs. Energy savings in turn reduce the need to site and pay for new power generation facilities, transmission lines and pipelines, thereby helping to moderate energy prices, which further benefits all consumers and businesses. Less energy and water waste lead to less pollution, helping to protect the air and public health and easing pressure on over-burdened water supplies.”
OTHER KEY FINDINGS
The utility bill savings from standards easily outweigh estimates of the cost to make products more efficient to meet standards. Benefits outweigh estimated costs by 5 to 1 using cost estimates made at the time standards were established.
Accounting for products sold between 1987 and 2035 and for estimated product price increases, total net present value savings from national standards for products sold through 2035 are $2.4 trillion for US consumers and businesses, or roughly enough to purchase 70 million new cars based on 2016 average prices.
ABOUT THE GROUPS
ASAP (www.appliance-standards.org) organizes and leads a broad-based coalition effort that works to advance, win and defend new appliance, equipment and lighting standards which deliver large energy and water savings, monetary savings and environmental benefits.  Working together, the ASAP coalition supports new and updated standards at the national and state levels through technical and policy advocacy and through outreach and education. ASAP was founded in 1999 by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the Alliance to Save Energy, the Energy Foundation, and Natural Resources Defense Council.
Since 1969, the nonprofit National Consumer Law Center® [www.nclc.org] has used its expertise in consumer law and energy policy to work for economic security for low-income and other disadvantaged people in the United States.  NCLC has a strong focus on ensuring that low-income households can afford the energy they need.  Advocating for strong appliance standards are a key part of that effort. 
The Northwest Power and Conservation Council is an interstate agency that was formed in 1981 by the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington under Congressional authorization granted by the Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act of 1980 (Power Act). This federal statute charged the Council with developing a regional power and conservation plan to assure the Pacific Northwest of an adequate, efficient, economical, and reliable power supply and to protect, mitigate and enhance the fish and wildlife resources impacted by the development and operation of the federal hydroelectric generating projects on the Columbia and Snake Rivers.
  The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.

ACEEE Supports Bipartisan Portman-Shaheen Energy Efficiency Bill;"Statement by Lowell Ungar, ACEEE's senior policy advisor
""If there is anything on which Congress should be able to agree, it is the Portman-Shaheen bill. Senators Rob Portman and Jeanne Shaheen have led the fight for bipartisan, sensible energy efficiency legislation since 2011. Their bill, the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, would help consumers, workers, businesses, states, the economy, and the environment. It would save energy in homes, commercial and federal buildings, and manufacturing plants.""

Electric Cars Sweep Greenest Vehicle List off its Feet;"Washington, DC—Looking for a show-stopping present for that special someone? Love the environment - and your car? Want to know which model year 2017 vehicle has the smallest environmental footprint? This Valentine’s Day, the answers to these questions are revealed in the 20th annual environmental ratings at greenercars.org, released by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
The comprehensive website lists the year’s Greenest, Meanest, Greener Choices, and best-in-class vehicles. It features an informative write-up on model year 2017 market trends, a consumer primer on vehicles and the environment, and advice on how to buy green when shopping for a new car or truck.
“Anyone buying a new car now has plenty of options for making an environmentally smart decision,” said Eric Junga, Transportation Research Analyst at ACEEE. “Whether you are looking to purchase the greenest car available, or the greenest vehicle for your needs such as a minivan, or simply stay away from the bottom of the list, greenercars.org can help you.” 
The following vehicles comprise the Greenest List for 2017. Each car is given a whole number Green Score based on an environmental damage index (EDX), which estimates pollution from vehicle manufacturing, the production and distribution of fuel, and vehicle tailpipes.
                           The new midsize Hyundai Ioniq Electric tops the Greenest List with the highest-ever Green Score of 64, followed closely by the BMW i3. In the last 10 years, the top spot has been claimed only by compact or subcompact vehicles so Ioniq’s first place is quite a feat. The Ioniq is expected to hit the market initially with a 110-mile range, but Hyundai has already mentioned the possibility of a 200-plus-mile version in the future. A hybrid version of the Ioniq will also be available and scores comparably to other vehicles on the Greenest List.
Toyota’s Prius line performs exceedingly well once again, with the lithium-ion Prius Eco variant nabbing the third spot, while the new plug-in Prius Prime and Prius C claim spots 8 and 9. Two hybrid vehicles—the Honda Accord Hybrid and the Kia Niro Hybrid—claim 11th and 12th position. For the second consecutive year, the Greenest List is completely populated by plug-in and hybrid vehicles and contains no vehicle with solely an internal combustion engine. The Mitsubishi Mirage scores the highest of any purely gasoline-powered vehicle with a 58, narrowly missing a spot on this year’s list with a Green Score just below the Niro’s.
“For the second year in a row, plug-in electric vehicles—all-electrics and plug-in hybrids--dominate the Greenest List, proving that these vehicles are really coming into their own,” said Junga. “Even the all-electrics are associated with significant emissions, however, arising from vehicle production and the electricity used for charging. It’s notable that conventional hybrids continue to be environmentally competitive with the plug-ins, taking four of the Greenest slots.”
Vehicles new to the list this year are the much anticipated Chevrolet Bolt and the new Honda Accord Hybrid, which claim the 6th and 11th spots respectively. The Bolt is the first EV with a range of more than 200 miles to make the Greenest List, and at $29,995 after federal tax credits, it opens the EV market to more buyers. The Honda Accord Hybrid, on hiatus last year, claims class-leading fuel economy with modest improvements over its predecessor. Once again this year, a diverse array of manufacturers is represented among the top 12 vehicles.
Greenercars.org also identifies practical options in each class among the top widely available, automatic transmission, petroleum-fueled models, because many of the vehicles on the Greenest list are not widely available or may not meet the needs of every individual. The Greener Choices list includes trucks and SUVs, such as the Chevrolet Colorado diesel and Honda CR-V. The new Chrysler Pacifica fills the slot for vans on the Greener Choices list and is accompanied on the market this year by a new plug-in hybrid version, which earns an impressive score of 49, better than many compact cars. The gasoline-powered smart fortwo coupe and Toyota Yaris iA top their respective car classes, scoring just below the vehicles on the Greenest List. As the list demonstrates, consumers can make greener choices whatever their vehicle needs. The Big Three American automakers claimed five of the 12 Greener Choices spots:
Greenercars.org provides the facts necessary to examine the environmental performance of any 2017 model. Each vehicle is assigned a Green Score, a single measure that incorporates lifecycle greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions. Updates to this year’s methodology include new estimates of emissions from a decrease in gasoline sulfur content as well as adjustments to electricity emissions factors.
Greenercars.org also provides a Meanest List, comprised this year as usual by large SUVs, heavier medium-duty vehicles and European luxury cars that are the least friendly to the environment.
Green Scores of the 1,000+ configurations of all model year 2017 vehicles are available for free in the greenercars.org interactive database, along with each configuration’s fuel economy, health-related pollution impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions. Visitors to the database can also build custom lists for comparing vehicles.
For interview requests and reprintable graphics of the Greenest, Greener Choices, and Meanest lists, media should contact Patrick Kiker at 202.507.4043, pkiker@aceee.org.

Demand response programs can reduce utilities’ peak demand an average of 10%, complementing savings from energy efficiency programs;"Demand response and energy efficiency programs are complementary: energy efficiency reduces both energy use and peak demand while demand response provides additional peak demand reductions. In this blog, we use data to illustrate the importance of each, including some new data on actual savings from demand response programs. 
For more than 20 years, ACEEE has been taking a close look at the energy savings from utility-sector energy efficiency programs. In 2015, we estimate that these programs saved about 200 billion kWh, more than 5% of retail electric sales in the United States that year (based on an analysis of data through 2014 and updated to include 2015 savings). In some leading states, the savings from these programs exceed 10% of retail electric sales already and could reach more than 20% by 2020.
These energy efficiency savings also substantially reduce peak energy demand---the time of the day and year when the demand for electricity is highest. For example, we recently reviewed data reported to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) on energy and peak demand savings for 25 program administrators (those reporting the highest total energy savings in 2015 and that together account for more than half of incremental energy savings in 2015). We found that for each 1% reduction in electric sales for a utility, on a median basis, peak demand reductions from efficiency programs are 0.66% of peak demand for that utility. If these trends hold for additional utilities and future years, it would mean that for a utility that reduces retail sales by 15%, the peak demand savings will be around 10%.
These energy savings and peak demand reductions from energy efficiency programs help reduce system costs and avoid outages. Still, many regions face challenges meeting peak demand. This is where demand response comes in. Demand response refers to the various strategies used to reduce loads during peak periods, and shift these loads to periods with lower power demand. Demand response includes a wide variety of strategies including interruptible rates, air conditioner and water heater cycling programs, and pricing programs such as peak time rebates. In a variety of prior studies, ACEEE has estimated that demand response programs can be used to reduce peak demand by 10% or more (for example see our studies on Ohio and South Carolina). These savings are above and beyond the peak savings from energy efficiency programs that we discuss above.
Now that utilities have been running demand response programs for a decade or more, we can assess how much these programs actually save. We looked at energy efficiency and demand response savings data for 2015 (the most recent year available) collected by the EIA, a branch of the US Department of Energy. For demand response, EIA collects two types of numbers – potential and actual reductions measured in megawatts (MW). Potential peak demand savings refers to the total demand savings that could occur at the time of the system peak hour assuming all of an individual utility’s in-place demand response strategies are used. Actual peak demand savings are demand reductions achieved by demand response activities, measured at the time of the company’s annual system peak hour. Actual savings address the fact that many utilities did not activate all demand response capability in 2015. We looked at all utilities that reported potential demand response savings of 200 MW or more – a total of 28 utilities. These 28 utilities represent 64% of the potential demand response savings reported to EIA, and 58% of the actual reductions reported to EIA.
For these 28 utilities, we found that potential demand response savings ranged from 2-27% of the utility’s peak demand, with 10% peak demand savings being the average. Of the 28 utilities, 59% reported potential peak demand savings of 10% or more. Data on the top dozen utilities are reported in the figure below. Actual demand response savings ranged from 0%-24% of utility peak demand, with an average of 4%. Four utilities reported actual demand response savings of more than 10% of their peak demand. Only two utilities reported actual reductions equal to 100% of their potential demand reductions while eight of these utilities either reported zero actual savings or did not provide actual savings data. Of the 25 utilities providing actual savings data, 10 used at least half of their available potential reductions.
These data are reported by each utility to EIA and may contain errors. We did delete a few utilities for which there were obvious errors (a few utilities reported demand response savings in excess of their peak demand!). Further exploration of these data would be useful, such as a better understanding of why some utilities used most of their demand response resources and others very little. For example, utilities that are long on capacity are probably less likely to call much of their available demand response resource. Still, this initial analysis does illustrate that utilities with extensive demand response programs can achieve reductions of more than 10% of system peak if they choose to use these resources.
You can find the data on the 28 utilities with potential demand reductions of 200 MW or more here.

“Summer Study” goes to India’s “Pink City”;"India, the world's most populous democracy, is making strides toward boosting its energy efficiency. Its efforts include the bulk purchase and distribution of over 200 million LED bulbs (substantially bringing down the price), efficiency standards on several types of appliances, and significant efforts on industrial and agricultural efficiency. You can find information on some of these steps in the India section at the back of ACEEE’s International Energy Efficiency Scorecard.  
That’s not all. An India-based group, the Alliance for an Energy-Efficient Economy (AEEE), is now gearing up to help the country further its progress. I'm pleased to say that ACEEE is working with the group as it prepares for its first conference, a milestone worth noting for the global energy efficiency community. 
The event will be patterned after ACEEE's biennial Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, which began in 1980. The ACEEE conference brings together leading energy efficiency practitioners in an informal setting to hear the latest in research findings and program and policy ideas. Participants have ample opportunity to interact with peers. This has been our most popular conference, drawing more than 1000 attendees and spawning innovative programs and policies in such areas as market transformation, building commissioning, utility and government programs, equipment efficiency standards, and emerging technologies. The ACEEE Summer Study has spurred similar events in Europe and Australia.
The India event, the AEEE Energy Efficiency Conclave, will be held November 29-December 1, 2017 in Jaipur, the capital of the state of Rajasthan. Similar to the ACEEE Summer Study, the AEEE Conclave will feature refereed (peer-reviewed) paper presentations, plenary sessions, informal sessions, and plenty of time to network with other attendees in a fun setting. The conference will focus on energy efficiency opportunities in India’s booming economy (economic growth in 2016 was higher in India than in China), but will also feature lessons learned from other countries that might apply in India. Both Indian and international participants are invited.
AEEE is now accepting abstracts for papers. Abstracts may be up to 250 words and should address topics in one of three areas: (1) buildings, (2) business and industry, and (3) codes, standards, and other policies. They are due March 20, 2017. If your abstract is selected, draft papers are due June 12, 2017, and final papers by Aug. 21, 2017. Further information on abstracts and papers can be found here.  Several ACEEE staff will be submitting abstracts.
The conference promises to be fascinating. So, too, is the host city, which I have visited. Jaipur is known as the pink city after the pink sandstone used in many of its old buildings. It features many old and interesting buildings on the edge of the desert. The city is a one-hour flight or a five- to six-hour train ride from Delhi. For those interested in visiting the Taj Mahal, you can take a slightly longer route and go via Agra.
The Energy Efficiency Conclave is being organized by AEEE in association with ACEEE and with partial funding from the MacArthur Foundation’s India Climate Leadership program. AEEE can provide invitation letters for international participants and other information about getting an Indian visa.  Further information about the conference will be posted as the event gets nearer, but for now, interested participants should put the event on their calendars and, if you are interested in presenting a paper, think about paper topics for abstracts.

Art Rosenfeld, the “Godfather of Energy Efficiency” and an ACEEE founder, passed away today;"Art Rosenfeld, a leading physicist and one of the founders of ACEEE, passed away today at age 90. Art began the energy efficiency research program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in the 1970s, and was instrumental in training and motivating an entire generation of energy efficiency practitioners. He helped found ACEEE in 1980, was a member of the board of directors until 2013, and has been a member of our Research Advisory Board since then. More than anyone else, Art was responsible for conducting early research on utilizing energy efficiency as a resource and publicly championing the fact that investing in energy efficiency is often less expensive than building more power plants. His work has influenced energy policy in California, the United States, and internationally, and it would be impossible to estimate how many billions of dollars and tons of carbon dioxide emissions have been saved due to his efforts.
We will miss Art – not only his technical contributions, but his wit and warmth– and will cherish his memory. We will continue to follow his vision of conducting cogent analyses, and clearly presenting the facts to policymakers and the public in order to influence programs and policies.

How to ensure clean water supplies? Energy-efficient desalination could be key;"(This is the fourth blog post in our series on the energy-water nexus. Our first post outlined the potential impact of climate change, our second suggested methods of reducing energy and water consumption, and our third summarized ACEEE’s past work in this area and potential future work.)
The coastal United States faces difficult challenges as it seeks to provide clean water to its growing population. Because of saltwater intrusion, it may need to construct more energy-intensive water desalination plants or implement underutilized water reuse techniques. This prospect presents a grave concern to those in the energy industry, which is why this post concludes with recommendations for coastal areas to minimize water and energy consumption as they address water shortage concerns.
Our growing population and saltwater intrusion will stress water supply and energy resources
At the current rate, the United States would require an additional 11 billion gallons of fresh water per day in 2020, compared to 2016, despite the long-term trend of less water use per capita (largely thanks to water efficiency programs). Certain coastal areas will also experience more water stress from climate change than their non-coastal counterparts. Saltwater intrusion into traditional fresh water aquifers in states like Florida means these areas may need to consider implementing more advanced treatment methods or finding new water sources. Californians suffered through six years of drought, and though the recent heavy rainfall has brought relief, there is no guarantee that the state’s water struggles are over. A 2016 NASA study found 9% of the US coastline is especially susceptible to saltwater infiltration of fresh groundwater supply, including areas in southeastern Florida, Southern California, and Long Island, New York.
Figure 2: Coastal areas vulnerable to saltwater intrusion (highlighted in pink and teal) (source: climate.nasa.gov/news/2473/study-maps-hidden-water-pollution-in-us-coastal-areas)
Since brackish water and seawater require more intense treatment options than freshwater, membrane filtration techniques like reverse osmosis are typically needed to provide adequate filtration to meet US water quality regulations. Even though scientific advancements have improved the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of membranes, these techniques still require much more energy than traditional treatment of ground or surface water. For a sense of the magnitude of the difference, traditional water treatment techniques use approximately 2,000 kWh per million gallons of water, while seawater desalination plants (which frequently use reverse osmosis) use 15,000 kWh per million gallons of water on average.  
Coastal areas are beginning to plan how to address these anticipated water needs. They often look first at expanding water efficiency programs or, in some cases, installing reusable wastewater or gray water systems in new developments. Distributed systems may provide another opportunity to maximize the efficient use of water. Distributed wastewater management is an approach to water treatment design that focuses on optimizing wastewater collection, treatment, and dispersal. Frequently, distributed systems focus on reusing wastewater and stormwater.
Though water reuse is not currently a widespread form of water treatment, areas like St. Petersburg, Florida have successfully implemented advanced treatment systems. Reclaimed water now accounts for about 40% of the city’s total water demand. While an increase in the prevalence of distributed systems and water reuse would reduce water and energy consumption, certain steps need to be taken to maximize their efficiency potential.
How energy efficiency can help meet our water treatment challenges
No single silver bullet will dramatically reduce the energy consumption of a water treatment facility. Instead, we suggest a combination of techniques. Developing a new water treatment facility presents an opportunity for collaboration between electric and water utilities, which share the overlapping goals of reducing wasted energy and water. Electric and water utilities, which may not frequently coordinate with one another, would both benefit from contributing to the design process and creating an energy-efficient culture at the plant.
Water treatment planners should investigate the potential to implement a holistic distributed system design approach and water reuse into a community water system. Where possible, facility design should include a gravity-fed system to minimize the use of energy-intensive pumping. If using reverse osmosis membrane technology to treat brackish water or seawater, facilities should consider more energy-efficient techniques.
Installing high-efficiency equipment at plants, such as pumps and motors with variable frequency drives, also has the potential to save as much as 30-50% of pump energy. Advanced monitoring and controls techniques have the potential to reduce energy consumption significantly. Installing on-site generation, such as a combined heat and power or solar photovoltaic system, would allow the plan to utilize cheaper and cleaner energy sources.
Factoring energy efficiency into the culture at the plant from the start will pay dividends later, such as developing energy benchmarks, setting energy targets, tracking performance, and rewarding progress. The standard ISO 50001 provides a framework to incorporate energy efficiency into facility operation, which includes requirements for energy audits, staff training, and energy savings measurement and verification.
Based on current trends, cities and communities throughout the United States, especially those in coastal areas, will need to consider how to address changing water needs. The construction of new water treatment plants presents an opportunity to integrate energy efficiency methods into water treatment plant design. We should also continue to increase our water efficiency in order to slow the growth of demand. As the resource management challenges in the future overlap, so should our solutions.

Training needed! Energy efficiency firms struggle to find qualified workers;"As the US unemployment rate nears a 10-year low, some companies report trouble finding skilled workers. The problem is particularly pervasive, as new data show, in the energy efficiency sector.
More than 80% of employers in this sector report at least some difficulty finding qualified job applicants, and more than 40% indicate it’s “very difficult,” according to the Department of Energy’s second annual energy and employment report released this month.
These numbers are slightly higher than the 76% reported last year for the energy efficiency sector or the 73% reported this year for all energy employers. Both years, and across the energy efficiency sector, the hiring challenge appears toughest in the construction industry.
Why such a problem? Employers say the top reason is “insufficient qualifications, certifications, and education,” followed by “lack of experience, training, or technical skills.” Their responses show a stark need for workforce training, especially given the broad economic benefits of energy efficiency. They also indicate a need for diversity, because men account for three of every four energy efficiency workers.
Despite the hiring challenges, the DOE report has good news. It expects a 9% increase this year in the number of energy efficiency workers. Already, it says 2.2 million Americans work at least part time in designing, installing, and manufacturing energy-efficient products and services such as those that carry the blue Energy Star label. This number is a conservative estimate. As ACEEE recently explained, the data cover only direct jobs rather than the indirect ones that result from the monetary savings of energy efficiency.
Also noteworthy: The anticipated job gains for energy efficiency outpace those for all energy firms covered by the DOE survey, which are expected to increase about 5% this year.

EPA Takes Appropriate Next Step on Vehicle Standards;"Statement of Therese Langer, Transportation Program Director
ACEEE welcomes the EPA’s final determination that greenhouse gas emissions standards for light-duty vehicles of model year (MY) 2022-2025 remain appropriate in light of the information available to date. The standards will save consumers tens of billions of dollars at the pump, will help ensure that domestic automakers continue to be at the forefront of global advances in auto technology, and are essential to keeping the United States on course to meet its climate goals.
EPA’s determination affirming the standards through MY 2025 is part of the “midterm evaluation” required under the 2012 rule setting standards for MY 2017-2025. For many years, automakers had emphasized the critical importance of adequate lead time for achieving substantial increases in fuel economy and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, they voiced concern that standards set well in advance might overshoot the levels that would seem appropriate as the model years approached. Yet vehicle efficiency technology advances are now in fact outpacing the agencies’ earlier projections, and EPA’s action should allow the highly successful program of vehicle standards to proceed as planned.
The agency’s determination is based upon a thorough draft Technical Assessment Report (TAR) issued last July by EPA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the California Air Resources Board, as well as stakeholders’ comments on the TAR and EPA follow-up work. The analysis shows that the standards are still achievable and cost-effective despite lower oil prices, partly due to the emergence of technologies not contemplated in the compliance packages the agencies constructed for the 2012 rulemaking. Taken together, increases in vehicle standards for the period MY 2012-2025 will nearly double the fuel efficiency of cars and light-trucks relative to MY 2010.

EmPOWER Maryland Will Save Customers $4 Billion on Electric Bills;"New Analysis Shows Maryland Energy Efficiency Program Has Far-Reaching Benefits
  Baltimore, MD—Maryland electric customers will save more than $4 billion due to energy efficiency improvements made at homes and businesses through a successful Maryland program, according to a first-of-its-kind study from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). The study, co-authored by a former Maryland Public Service Commission energy analyst, highlights how the first phase of EmPOWER Maryland has yielded substantial economic growth and environmental benefits across the state.
EmPOWER Maryland, enacted in 2008, created energy efficiency programs that are offered through the state’s five largest electric utilities. The program helps homeowners and businesses save energy, partly by offering incentives and technical assistance for adding insulation, sealing air leaks, and installing more efficient appliances. It also facilitates efficient commercial lighting and other improvements at industrial facilities.
ACEEE’s study reveals that EmPOWER Maryland has produced significant benefits, including:
More than $4 billion in savings in total customer bills over the life of the improvements, which were made between 2008 and 2015;
$1.81 in benefits for every dollar spent on energy efficiency measures as a result of lower wholesale prices for energy, savings from reduced need to build new power plants and power lines, reduced air pollution, and reduced need for electricity production;
Total lifetime energy savings of more than 51 million megawatt hours, equivalent to the electricity used by 850,000 residential customers over five years;
Reduced emissions of nearly 19 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, more than 34 million pounds of nitrogen oxides, and nearly 78 million pounds of sulfur dioxide over the lifetime of the programs.
The full study can be viewed at: http://aceee.org/research-report/u1701
“EmPOWER Maryland is an unqualified success story for the state,” said Brendon Baatz, study co-author and utilities policy manager at ACEEE. Yet despite its achievements, Baatz believes the program’s future is not guaranteed: “With Phase One of the program complete, Maryland regulators must now renew their support for EmPOWER Maryland so that consumers and businesses can continue to reap the benefits of lower utility bills and cleaner air.”
“EmPOWER has proven critical for helping us improve the energy efficiency of our affordable multifamily properties, which lowers utility costs and provides healthy homes for our residents” said Trisha Miller, sustainability director for WISHROCK. “At Windsor Valley Apartments, EmPOWER helped fund efficiency improvements that are expected to reduce utility bills by as much as 20% per year. Without EmPOWER, the upfront costs of making these upgrades can be prohibitive in the affordable housing industry.”
The first phase EmPOWER Maryland aimed to reduce per capita electricity usage 10% and peak electricity demand 15% by 2015. The Maryland Public Service Commission, in its annual report to the legislature in 2015, concluded that state utilities achieved 99% of the per capita consumption goal and 100% of the per capita demand reduction goal.
Due in part to the EmPOWER Maryland program, Maryland now ranks as the ninth most energy-efficient state in the nation, according to ACEEE.

We knew energy efficiency employs a lot of people, and now we know how many;"As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office next week, he will be looking to make good on his campaign promise to create jobs and strengthen the economy. He needs look no further than energy efficiency. A new report shows it’s already supporting at least 1.9 million US jobs.
The energy efficiency industry has a remarkably diverse workforce in the United States, ranging from appliance manufacturers and home retrofitters to cloud-based energy management service providers. But since energy efficiency involves so many sectors of the economy, the government can’t collect statistics on it the way it can for the banking or auto industries. This makes it extremely difficult to quantify how many people are employed in energy efficiency-related businesses, because it’s not as clear as counting the number of people who work in a car factory.
Last month, however, E4TheFuture and Environmental Entrepreneurs released a report that does the best job I’ve seen yet of providing a reliable answer. Using a methodology similar to the one the government uses to produce its official statistics, they found that about 1.9 million people worked full- or part-time on energy efficiency in 2015. They found that total was set to increase by almost a quarter of a million last year, making energy efficiency the largest industry in the clean energy economy. It employs about twice as many workers as the auto industry (including auto parts manufacturers), and almost 10 times as many workers as the oil and gas extraction industry. It’s a big number.
Figuring this out is neither easy nor straightforward (which is why we’ve needed a study like this), and there are some drawbacks to doing it. First, the methodology includes every worker who spent any fraction of time working on energy efficiency. It’s the same standard that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to estimate employment by industry, and while about 890,000 workers spend at least half their time on energy efficiency, the number will necessarily include a fair number of workers who spent less. By the very nature of the question it’s trying to answer, the number has to be an estimate. Of all the attempts I’ve seen to get at this answer, however, this one is clearly the best, and it gives us a good number to work with. In addition, the report provides results at the state level, giving us an even clearer look at the efficiency industry.
Why it’s actually a conservative estimate
The report is an easy read if you’re looking for details, but there are a few points worth highlighting. About half of the workers identified by the study work for small businesses, and about one-third of the businesses in the survey get all of their revenue from energy efficiency. This paints a picture of an efficiency industry that includes both large employers that are often part of the core of a local economic base as well as family businesses that are less visible individually but still form part of the backbone of a growing economy. The fact that a significant number of these businesses get all of their revenue from efficiency work indicates how ubiquitous and integral efficiency is becoming.
And while 1.9 million workers is a lot, it’s actually a conservative estimate of the number of jobs supported by energy efficiency. The aim of the study was to identify the number of workers employed in making and installing energy-efficient technologies, putting a clear definition on the efficiency industry that we often talk about.
If we wanted to talk about all of the jobs supported by energy efficiency, we would have to  include all those jobs created and supported by the savings that efficiency generates for families and businesses. These people typically won’t work in the efficiency industry but rather are spread across the economy. In our experience modeling efficiency investments, we find that re-spending the energy savings typically creates an equivalent number of jobs as implementing the investment.
Energy efficiency is often thought of as invisible. It’s hard to see, and it can be hard to measure. In reality, over the past 25 years, it has been the single largest contributor to meeting our energy needs. It impacts every aspect of the economy, from heavy industry to home appliances. The Trump administration could help employ millions more by increasing energy efficiency investments, making this seemingly invisible job creator more visible.

Green financing remains key, but what’s the best way forward? We want your ideas;"2017 will usher in a new administration and likely some changes in federal energy policy. Despite the uncertainty of such change, one fact is clear: financing of energy efficiency investments is more important than ever.
States, cities, and, corporations have committed to continue building the clean energy economy. They will need to either dig deeper into their budgets or find new funding strategies to make progress. Fortunately, financing can help stretch a dollar, and investor appetite for green bonds – one such source - skyrocketed to more than $80 billion last year.
What’s next for financing? We’re building a dynamic agenda for our Finance Forum 2017, and there’s still time to help shape it by sharing your ideas for topics. Our event has been the world’s preeminent conference on energy efficiency financing for more than a decade.
Hosted this year in Chicago, Finance Forum will dedicate a portion of its program to energy efficiency in the Midwest. It will feature the endeavors and accomplishments of Illinois and the surrounding states. It will also serve as a venue for companies and agencies to share knowledge on how to scale-up efficiency at both the national and regional level.
The May 21-23 forum will build on topics explored at last year’s conference in Rhode Island: green bonds as well as public-private partnerships and other financing strategies to leverage public dollars. These topics could be essential in the next administration. President-elect Donald Trump has underlined the importance of rebuilding our infrastructure, specifically mentioning public-private partnerships and state revolving loan funds.
In addition to the Midwest focus, the upcoming forum will likely discuss resiliency, creating a green or infrastructure bank, the state of On-Bill and PACE financing, new financing methods, and successful programs in the residential, commercial, and multifamily sectors. Again, if you have topic or panel ideas, please email us at FinanceForum@aceee.org. If you’re new to the field, we hold a half-day, pre-conference session called “Energy Efficiency Financing 101” so you can quickly learn the ins and outs of the industry.

2017 is looking like a good year for energy efficiency as investments grow;"As the new year begins, we expect 2017 will bring increased investments in energy efficiency and other efforts to save energy.
The energy efficiency investment picture indicates that savings will continue to grow. Spending on energy-efficient goods and services as well as employment in energy efficiency jobs has increased in recent years, and these trends will likely continue. The International Energy Agency estimates that energy efficiency spending increased about 6% from 2014 to 2015, with 2015 spending totaling about $221 billion in major economies throughout the world (2016 figures not yet available). Similarly for the United States, BW Research in a report for the Department of Energy, found that 1.9 million Americans work full- or part-time energy efficiency jobs and that companies planned to hire another 260,000 energy efficiency workers in 2016. This job growth is spurred by a growing private sector focus on energy efficiency and strong policies, particularly at the state and local levels.
Federal policy forecast is less clear
With the Trump administration about to take office, some changes are likely at the federal level. Since the president-elect and his appointees have said little about energy efficiency, however, we do not have clear signals. As I wrote after the election, there may be opportunities for energy efficiency in an infrastructure package and as part of tax reform. On the other hand, there may be a need to defend existing federal energy efficiency policies and budgets if they come under attack. Budget issues will be debated by Congress in the spring (for the second half of the 2017 fiscal year) and summer and fall (for the 2018 fiscal year). A few energy efficiency regulations finalized by the Obama administration in recent months could be reconsidered by Congress this spring under the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to override recent regulations. However, there’s also a good chance that the limited Congressional floor time available for regulatory review will not be used for any energy efficiency regulations. Other legislative and regulatory actions will probably unfold gradually as the year progresses. They could roll back certain regulations or make it more difficult to issue new regulations. As the situation becomes clearer, I’ll write another blog post focused specifically on federal changes. 
Progress likely in states, with some exceptions
While the situation in Washington DC is unclear, it is likely that many states will take energy efficiency actions. The Louisiana and Mississippi Public Service Commissions are holding proceedings on how best to expand utility energy efficiency programs from initial “quick start” programs to full-scale ones. Final action is expected in both states by the end of the year. Likewise, the North Carolina Utilities Commission is undertaking a proceeding on data access. Additional actions may also happen in the Tar Heel State as a new governor, Roy Cooper, takes office. Illinois and Michigan will be activity implementing new energy laws (including energy efficiency provisions) that passed in late 2016. Energy efficiency programs are likely to expand, perhaps starting in 2018. Delaware is also planning to expand energy efficiency programs based on legislation passed in 2014. Implementation has been moving slowly but will hopefully accelerate in 2017. On the other hand, while the Ohio legislature is interested in energy legislation, it wants to make energy efficiency programs voluntary for utilities. It passed a bill in late 2016 that Governor John Kasich vetoed. We expect further discussion in the Buckeye State in 2017. In 2015, Maryland established higher energy-saving targets for utilities, but appointees of Governor Larry Hogan have suggested they be scaled back. A coalition of energy efficiency supporters, including ACEEE, is organizing to oppose any rollback. For example, ACEEE will be releasing several reports on the energy savings as well as the job, economic development, and health benefits of the Maryland programs. Likewise, the Pennsylvania legislature has been considering legislation to allow large customers to opt-out of paying for energy efficiency programs. The legislation passed the Senate but not the House in 2016; it could come back in 2017.
Local energy efficiency efforts continue to be promising
Local energy efficiency activity is also growing, as shown in ACEEE’s State and Local Policy Database. For example last year, seven US cities passed energy benchmarking and transparency laws. We expect more cities to take advantage of the energy efficiency benefits of these policy changes in 2017. Energy efficiency is also making waves in real estate markets. The city of Portland, Oregon passed legislation that will allow homebuyers and sellers to compare the energy costs and performance of homes and to identify energy-saving home improvements. City-utility partnerships are increasingly important as cities work to reduce high household energy burdens and make energy more affordable for their communities. Detroit, Minneapolis, and Boston are good examples. We are now documenting many recent and pending actions for our 3rdCity Energy Efficiency Scorecard, which will be released in the spring (the 2nd scorecard can be found here).
Overall, we are expecting 2017 to be a generally good year for energy efficiency. While negative developments may occur at the federal level, state/local and private market activity are already driving large investments and could bring huge opportunities in the future.

Five new energy-saving standards from Barack Obama, but Donald Trump will get the final word;"Yesterday, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued five new efficiency standards, culminating a decade of energy efficiency progress that began under President George W. Bush. The new standards, the last of many developed during the Obama administration, will save consumers money, help meet the nation’s energy needs and reduce environmentally harmful emissions, including greenhouse gases. However, each of these new standards must clear one more hurdle before they are truly complete, which means the Trump administration will get the final word on this last batch of Obama-era standards.
First, the new standards. They cover an eclectic mix of products. The first national standards for uninterruptible power supplies, portable air conditioners and swimming pool pumps, which are based on a consensus agreement, each deliver surprisingly large savings. For pool pumps, California has led the way with pool pump motor standards and Arizona, Connecticut, and Washington have followed. California and Oregon have previously set standards for uninterruptible power supplies as part of their battery charger standards. Building on this state leadership, the new DOE standards provide a consistent national standard for these products rather than state-by-state regulation. 
For walk-in coolers and commercial boilers, DOE’s latest actions would update existing national standards, originally signed into law by George W. Bush and his father, respectively. Manufacturers and installers of walk-in coolers negotiated the walk-in cooler levels with DOE and other stakeholders (including ASAP) after a lawsuit invalidated some earlier standards. The commercial boiler standards modestly increase the minimum levels for the heating equipment used in many mid- to large-sized buildings.
Altogether, this batch of new standards will save consumers and businesses $15 billion to $35 billion, according to DOE’s estimates.  My colleagues Joanna Mauer and Chris Granda have described each in more detail in separate posts (pool pumps, portable air conditioners, uninterruptible power supplies, walk-in coolers, and commercial boilers).
None of these standards has been especially controversial. But, in each case, the incoming Trump administration will get the final word. Under recently-instituted DOE processes, final rules must be available for public review for at least 45 days before DOE can send them for official publication in the Federal Register. Standards published in the Federal Register after President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration will be at the discretion of the new administration.
One exception: the new swimming pool pump standards are exempt from this 45-day review period, because DOE is adopting them under a special process permitted for consensus-based standards. But, this special process also permits the DOE Secretary to withdraw the new standard if significant objections are raised within the next few months. (The walk-in cooler standard is also a consensus-based standard, but DOE chose to adopt it through the process requiring the 45-day review period).
So, what does all this mean? Donald Trump and his DOE Secretary-designate Rick Perry, if confirmed by the Senate, will get the final word on each of these new standards.
Needless to say, the new secretary comes at energy policy from a different perspective than his immediate predecessors, and he’ll want to review all sorts of matters handed off to him. Undoubtedly, he will hear from some advisors that anything to do with the Obama administration should be deep-sixed.
But there is reason to hope based on his record in Texas and those of previous Republican administrations that he’ll take a more pragmatic approach. Rick Perry knows something about conservation standards. As governor of Texas, he signed a package of water conservation standards into law. The 2009 state law, passed as an element of the state’s response to persistent drought, shows that even deeply conservative lawmakers can embrace the need for reasonable standards.
Perry is not the first conservative governor of Texas to come around to support standards. As president, George W. Bush signed many standards into law as parts of the 2005 and 2007 national energy laws. Indeed, the enormous progress achieved on new standards during the Obama administration began under the Bush administration. After passage of the 2005 law and settling a lawsuit over many missed legal deadlines for updating standards, the Bush administration ramped up standards work.
The trajectory of the Bush administration was not unlike that of another famous conservative. After initially refusing to establish any standards, President Ronald Reagan signed the original 13 national standards into law in 1987. Each learned that a balanced and cost-effective approach to meeting the nation’s energy needs must address not only the amount of energy produced but also the amount consumed. In 2015, US electricity usage was about 13% lower than it would have been absent any standards.
And that balanced approach has led to real-world benefits for everyday American families. We estimate that the typical household spends about $500 less a year on utility bills thanks to existing national standards
Interestingly, a poll released last week showed that Trump voters also support national standards.  Seventy-six percent support “requiring manufacturers to make appliances more energy efficient.”
Let’s hope that the new administration starts with the same practical approach to efficiency standards that Reagan and Bush grew to embrace. With decisions due in the very first few months of new administration, we will know soon.

Gov. Kasich Stands with Energy Efficiency;"Statement of R. Neal Elliott, Senior Director for Research
ACEEE commends Governor Kasich for his veto of H.B. 554, which would have undermined energy efficiency programs in the state. The governor’s courageous action in the face of opposition from legislators from his own party means that Ohio will maintain its position as an energy efficiency leader in the Midwest. In the last decade, expanded energy efficiency programs have saved Ohioans hundreds of millions of dollars, while supporting an estimated 78,000 jobs in the state. The governor’s veto is an important step in keeping these programs intact, but it is not the end. Unfortunately, the legislative leadership has already indicated that they will try to turn back the clock next year. We encourage the governor to continue to stand up for utility customers in the Buckeye State against these continued attacks.
  The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.

New Michigan law strengthens energy efficiency and renewable energy standards;"Looking for some good clean energy news to close the year? In Michigan today, Governor Rick Snyder signed two sweeping bills that the state's legislature passed on December 15th, the last day of its end-of-year ‘lame duck’ session. The legislation extends and improves both the Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).
The EERS bill, SB 438, officially endorses and extends the state’s 1% annual energy savings requirement for utilities through 2021. It also removes the existing cap on energy efficiency program spending, adds tiered incentives to encourage utilities to exceed 1.5% annual savings, and increases the previous RPS requirement for renewable electricity from 10% to 15%.
This accomplishment is particularly noteworthy and encouraging, because both chambers of the Michigan legislature are dominated by the GOP, and Governor Snyder is a Republican as well. Snyder had previously announced his support, saying the new legislation will “save Michigan residents millions of dollars on their electric bills” and “find new ways to use our existing energy grid more efficiently.”
Several other Midwest states like Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin with similar political lineups have recently experienced setbacks to clean energy policy. Moreover, the original legislative proposals in Michigan last year called for eliminating the EERS and the RPS policies, under a call to “end the mandates.”
What accounts for this striking turnaround in Michigan? Admittedly, the clean energy elements of the legislation were part of a complex compromise package of energy policy reforms, particularly involving electric reliability and customer access to independent electricity suppliers. The need for a compromise package made these advancements possible. 
But an impressive and diverse collection of parties deserves credit for these energy policy improvements. They include a strong coalition of environmental and clean energy advocates, a well-organized group of major corporations supporting energy efficiency, some key conservative groups in Michigan, and good vocal support from the governor’s office. It should also be noted that the legislative leadership on both sides of the aisle showed good faith willingness to negotiate and support a positive bipartisan package.
Hopefully, this recently completed process and successful outcome for clean energy policies in Michigan will be a good example for state and federal action in 2017 and beyond.

The US will save trillions of dollars if Obama’s energy efficiency legacy stands;"The Obama administration’s energy efficiency efforts are saving billions of dollars each year and could save trillions by 2040. The projected savings by then are far more than what consumers now spend on phones and the Internet, combined.
Even as President Barack Obama has made energy efficiency a top priority, it’s remarkable that federal agencies have achieved these savings over the last eight years by implementing bipartisan laws passed before he entered the Oval Office. Our new analysis reveals how much the United States has saved and still can in the future. If President-elect Donald Trump does not want to shut off a huge moneymaker for the US economy, he should continue these policies.
As shown in the graph below, a few recent energy efficiency policies are helping Americans save about 2 quadrillion Btu (quads) of energy this year, or about 2% of all US energy use. These energy savings are worth about $30 billion this year. But that is just a small advance.
The real benefits should arrive long after Obama, and even after Trump, leaves the Oval Office. In the years to come, as people buy new cars and equipment and we hope as states implement more programs, the savings from policies already put in place will blossom. By 2030, we project these actions will save 10-14 quads of energy a year (10-14% of all energy use), worth $250-290 billion a year. By 2040, the savings continue to increase to 13-17 quads and $370-410 billion a year. They could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as a billion tons a year. We estimate the present value of the energy savings through 2040 at $2.5-2.9 trillion. (This does not count the investment needed, but that will be much smaller).
Note: Clean Power Plan shows potential savings if the plan survives and states use efficiency as a first choice to meet it (or if states add programs for other benefits).
The Three Policies
We estimated savings only for the three most significant energy efficiency policies set by the administration.
First, Congress directed the Department of Transportation (DOT) in 2007 to update fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks for the first time in decades, and to set new standards for heavier trucks and buses. The administration combined that direction with standards on tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions by the Environmental[WK2]  Protection Agency (EPA) and the state of California to achieve major oil savings with stunning consumer benefits—mostly with agreement from manufacturers. For trucks and buses, DOT and EPA recently set a second round of standards through 2027. However, the car and light truck standards for 2022-2025 are scheduled for review, and a large chunk of the savings shown in the graph could disappear if the standards are weakened.
Second, after decades of delays, the Department of Energy has actually followed the law in setting and updating appliance standards. It worked through a backlog under multiple laws and carried out a requirement for periodic review of standards under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. However, some of the standards were specified directly in the laws, and several of the most important were based on consensus agreements. A few still remain to be set. Again, it is important that the recent standards, and the billions of dollars in savings they are bringing to American consumers and businesses, not be reversed. In fact, the standards are to be updated over the next eight years, and in a recent paper, we found that the next round of standards could save about as much energy as the last one.
Third, along with regulating vehicle emissions, the EPA has begun to regulate carbon dioxide from other sources under the Clean Air Act, following a 2007 Supreme Court ruling. Most notably, in 2015, the, EPA issued regulations for existing power plants in [LU3] the Clean Power Plan. The graph shows potential savings from energy efficiency spurred by the plan (it does not address renewables or fuel switching). The savings are striped, because they are triply uncertain: the plan is under review by the courts and could be changed; Trump has vowed to kill it; and under the current plan, the states would have a lot of flexibility in how to meet the standard, including whether to use efficiency or different sources to cut emissions. But whether or not the plan survives, the striped area [WK4] shows the large savings states could achieve if more of them implement energy efficiency programs, which are usually the cheapest option for meeting electricity needs with or without the Clean Power Plan.
Of course, agencies have been implementing many other energy-efficiency policies and programs as well (though in some cases very slowly): Energy Star, support for building energy codes, low-interest loans through rural electric coops, guidelines for local government “PACE” financing, new programs like Better Buildings, research and development of new technologies, grants to state and local governments under the Recovery Act, retrofits of federal buildings, and more. Together these programs will save consumers money, boost the economy, create jobs, strengthen the energy system, clean the air, and improve public health for decades to come.
One of the quotes on the rug Obama had designed for the Oval Office reads: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” The arc of energy policy can be long too, but under Obama it has bent strongly towards energy efficiency. And while Trump has signaled skepticism towards climate change, he has often spoken about the value of a good deal. We hope the new administration will recognize the tremendous savings these policies have helped our nation’s consumers and businesses achieve, and it will continue to make saving energy and money a national priority.
Methodological Notes
The savings analyses follow similar methodologies to our 2014 white paper, Government Works, and are explained in more detail there, but all are updated here. I thank Joanna Mauer, Therese Langer, Siddiq Khan, and Eric Junga for their assistance in the calculations.
Estimates are for the impacts of the policies compared to a no-action baseline. We did not estimate measure costs this time (dollar figures only reflect energy savings). We did not include any interactive effects, though in some scenarios appliance standards savings could count toward the Clean Power Plan. Because the Plan is one of the policies, fuel prices and carbon dioxide intensities are taken from the Energy Information Administration’s 2016 Annual Energy Outlook No CPP case (unadjusted for the additional policies). Dollar amounts are in 2015 dollars. The present value uses a real 5% discount rate.
Fuel economy standards are estimated compared to a base case of 2010 fuel economies using Argonne National Laboratory’s Vision 2015 model. Appliance standards are estimated compared to previous standards, with fixed appliance efficiencies and sales (except the light bulb standard, which has a dynamic model as explained in Bending the Curve). For potential savings under the Clean Power Plan, we assumed states on average would achieve 1.25% new electricity savings each year through 2030 (and would also make up earlier savings that decay through 2040). But the reported savings are compared to 0.7% new savings each year that would still have occurred in the base case. The method (but not the numbers) is taken from the calculation for an energy efficiency resource standard in a report from last year.
The comparison of how much consumers spend on phones and phone service ($183 billion a year) and Internet ($104 billion) is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

New Ohio bill would be a step backwards, costing money and jobs.;"Energy efficiency faces a critical test this month in Ohio. Its tremendous progress in the state could be slowed unless Governor John Kasich vetoes a recently passed bill by the 28th of December.
What’s at stake are jobs and cost savings. Energy efficiency is an economic engine for Ohio, supporting more than 78,000 jobs in the state. To maximize its benefits, a nearly unanimous Ohio legislature passed a 2008 law that set a timetable for electric companies to meet one-fifth of energy needs with energy efficiency by 2025. More energy efficiency programs ensued, saving two dollars for every dollar spent. The result? Ohioans saved hundreds of millions of dollars.  
Opponents have moved to threaten this progress. In 2014, they passed SB 310, which put a freeze on the energy efficiency targets for two years. That freeze was due to expire at the end of this year, but the Ohio legislature passed another bill (HB 554) last week that, if enacted, would thwart state efforts to reduce energy waste. Fortunately, Governor Kasich has vowed to veto it.
The bill would extend the freeze of the state’s utility energy efficiency targets by keeping them voluntary for the next two years, and then reduce the required savings targets to just 1% per year from 2019-2025, before finally increasing them to 2% per year in 2026 and 2027. This would reduce total savings to Ohio consumers by nearly one-fourth, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in higher utility costs, not to mention the loss of jobs in the energy efficiency field.
The benefits of increasing energy efficiency are clear, so there is no reason to delay the work of the original 2008 legislation. Research shows that setting utility energy efficiency targets is the most effective policy to achieve large energy savings. Also, ACEEE research has documented how several utilities achieve annual savings of 2%, and how Ohio has real potential to achieve the original targets.
Extending the savings freeze isn’t the only negative impact of HB 554. The bill would allow “mercantile energy users” to opt out of the state’s energy efficiency requirements. It would expand the state’s existing opt-out policy by lowering the size threshold for eligibility to one of the lowest in the country and even allow national accounts to opt-out regardless of size (e.g. potentially gas stations and restaurants). Letting more businesses opt out would essentially make all the smaller ratepayers subsidize the efficiency resource for the largest customers. And if more customers opt out, rates go up for all customers as the lost savings from cost-effective energy efficiency programs need to be replaced with more expensive power purchases.
The bill would also allow utilities to count “savings” that have nothing to do with customer energy efficiency. For example, it would allow utilities to count energy intensity reductions resulting from heat rate improvements at electric generating plants, either owned by the utility or their affiliates. These types of allowances could mean that utilities drastically cut customer energy efficiency programs while meeting the targets.
If no bill is enacted by the end of the calendar year, the very effective original efficiency standards, along with the renewable energy standards, would go back into effect in 2017. That would be a wise course of action. Based on many years of evidence that prove energy efficiency is a good deal for Ohioans and their economy, we think good policy should get back to work.

Can the US cut its energy use in half by 2050? Yes, but we will have to double down on our efforts.;"Five years ago, ACEEE found that energy efficiency could reduce projected 2050 US energy use by 40–60%. As a result, ACEEE established a strategic goal to reduce projected 2050 energy use by 50%. We thought it was time to check on our progress and ask whether our goal still seems reasonable. We find that energy use has been stable in recent years, reversing historical growth, a very positive development that is due in significant part to increasing our energy efficiency. But if we want actual declines in energy use, we will need to double down on our efforts.
We also thought it would be useful to look at potential savings in terms of cost-effective efficiency policies in order to more clearly outline what needs to be done to reach this 2050 goal. So today we release a new white paper with the results of our new analysis. These energy savings are important, because they can save the nation billions in energy bills, create domestic jobs, protect the environment, and yield numerous other benefits.
Thirteen policies we’ll need to ramp up
We applied 13 efficiency packages to the reference case projection of future energy consumption in the 2016 Annual Energy Outlook (2016 AEO), prepared by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA). The packages are:
Appliance and equipment efficiency standards and complementary voluntary efforts
Zero net energy (ZNE) new buildings and homes
Smart buildings and homes
Home and commercial building retrofits
Behavior change in buildings
Industrial efficiency improvements
Combined heat and power (CHP) systems
Light and heavy duty vehicle fuel economy improvements
Reductions in passenger vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
Reductions in freight transport energy use
Aviation efficiency improvements
Reductions in losses from transmission and distribution (T&D) systems
Electric power plant efficiency improvements
Our analysis accounts for both overlap between measures, and direct and indirect rebound effects.
Lots of energy can be saved
We find that our 13 energy efficiency packages would reduce 2040 energy use by 34%. These 2040 energy savings put us on a path to achieve the 50% energy savings by our 2050 goal. We also looked at carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, finding that 2040 CO2 emissions would be reduced by 35% relative to the 2040 business-as-usual scenario, and also put carbon emissions on a 50% reduction path by 2050. These trends are illustrated in the figure below, which shows essentially flat energy use and emissions in the reference case but declining energy use and emissions in the energy efficiency case.
Energy and emissions reductions exist in all sectors of the economy—residential, commercial, industrial, transportation, and electric power. Savings and emissions reductions from our efficiency policies are largest in the transportation sector, followed closely by the commercial, industrial, and residential sectors. Transportation measures generally contribute a higher percentage to emissions reductions than to energy use reductions due to the relatively high carbon content of most transportation fuels.
Each of the 13 packages we examined contributes to putting us on the 50% energy use reduction path. The largest savings come from the industrial efficiency package, followed by ZNE new homes and buildings, vehicle fuel economy improvements, appliance and equipment efficiency, and home and commercial building retrofits.
We can get there, but will we?
Our analysis finds that the 13 efficiency measures we examine, if pursued aggressively, would put the United States on a path to reduce 2050 energy use by 50% relative to currently predicted levels. Achieving these energy efficiency savings will require expansion of energy efficiency efforts beyond business-as-usual, including:
New building codes, equipment efficiency standards, and ENERGY STAR® specifications
Substantial improvements to existing factories, homes, commercial buildings, T&D systems, and power plants
Efforts to better manage freight and aviation energy use, reduce VMT, and spur changes in how individuals use energy at home, at work, and in transport.
We must rigorously pursue all of these energy efficiency policy opportunities if we are to achieve these potential energy efficiency savings. We must also continue to invest in research and development to identify new efficiency measures; these will provide additional savings opportunities that we can only imagine today and that will complement the examined measures.
One may ask: will we actually put the policies in place to achieve these savings? Time will tell, but reducing energy waste is always a smart decision. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have taken actions to increase our nation’s efficiency. And while President-elect Donald Trump has focused on increasing fossil fuel production, he has also promised to strengthen our economy and create millions of domestic jobs. By taking these efficiency steps, the next President can make good on those promises. In addition, much of the action needed will take place at the state, local, business, and household levels. Washington can assist, but these other actors are critical.

How understanding the psychology of energy efficiency can help protect the environment;"Why do some people take action to reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprints while others do not? Environmental psychologists, behavioral economists and other social scientists have all investigated this question, and come up with a variety of answers. A new report, sponsored by the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions and co-authored by ACEEE, explains the psychology of individual energy efficiency actions, and how large scale behavior change programs can use this research to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Theories of change
One of the theories examined in the report is the theory of planned behavior, which suggests that people are influenced by how they think about their behavior. Will taking this action be good, or will doing it makes me feel happy? Are other people doing it? How easy is it to do? According to this theory, programs that target attitudes, perceived social norms, or perceived difficulty of the behavior, may successfully change behavior.
Real world application
Based on these theories, utilities and policymakers have created programs that motivate behavior change to reduce energy consumption, increase efficiency, and mitigate climate change. Strategies such as providing feedback to customers, recruiting champions of change to promote energy efficiency, or introducing a competition are three of the more common strategies. These and others are often combined to maximize the effectiveness of the program and create a lasting change that can significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
Behavior change is only part of the solution
States, utilities, and businesses interested in promoting energy efficiency or climate action don’t have to wait for top-down policies at the federal level to begin. This report is a concise resource for anyone interested in implementing a behavior change program. However, if we are going to make the changes necessary to really tackle climate change, psychology-based behavior change programs are only part of the solution; they work best when combined with traditional incentives, policies, and laws.

What's next for vehicle fuel economy?;"The Obama administration has been a great champion of higher fuel economy and corresponding reductions in vehicles’ emissions of greenhouse gases. There’s no reason to expect continuity in this area from the new administration, and an advisor to president-elect Trump has indicated that fuel economy and emissions standards are on their radar.
Standards for cars and light trucks of model years 2022-2025 are currently under review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). In an extensive and robust technical assessment report (TAR) issued in July as part of the review, the agencies found that the standards as adopted in 2012 are achievable and cost-effective. ACEEE’s comments on the TAR noted that, based on current information on technology cost, effectiveness, and deployment trends, the standards in fact could be strengthened.
Today, the EPA announced its proposed determination that the standards for model years 2022-2025 “remain appropriate,” starting the clock on a 30-day public comment period. EPA’s conclusion is hardly a surprise in view of the TAR findings. It’s worth noting that the proposed determination states that the technical record “could support a decision to adopt more stringent standards for 2022-2025.” However, in support of regulatory stability and long term planning, the EPA proposes instead to reaffirm the existing standards, having concluded its review of the comments submitted on the TAR.
EPA’s action should inform the remainder of the standards review process, which will unfold in the coming months:
NHTSA is required to conduct a full rulemaking on the model year 2022-2025 standards. However, as EPA’s co-author on the TAR, NHTSA has the technical basis for a proposed rule under its belt. There’s no legal requirement that fuel economy standards align with greenhouse gas emissions standards, but the close relationship between improving fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions means that automakers strongly prefer that the two standards be harmonized.
Automakers were already lobbying hard for a rollback of the 2022-2025 standards prior to the election. The manufacturers’ trade association sent a letter to the transition team on November 10th requesting various steps be taken to weaken the standards during the review process. But how far they’ll want to go is unclear, since the manufacturers and their suppliers have already invested substantially in the technologies needed to reach the 2025 standards. And the global vehicle market will continue to evolve toward lower-emitting vehicles.
A crucial factor here is the role of California, which has the ability to set its own vehicle standards. Given its ambitious carbon emission reduction goals, California is likely to uphold or strengthen its 2022-2025 car and light truck standards, which are consistent with the standards now under review by the EPA and NHTSA. Manufacturers strongly dislike having different standards for California—and the 10 other states that follow California standards--and the rest of the country.
Standards for heavy-duty vehicles are less likely to be challenged. “Phase 2” fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for these vehicles were finalized in August (out to model year 2027) with considerable industry support. At least one member of Congress is interested in taking on the new standards despite that broad-based support, and the standards could be subject to disapproval under the Congressional Review Act. But the incoming administration has yet to indicate any particular interest in revisiting this rule, which will put the United States at the forefront of global efforts to raise the fuel efficiency of commercial trucks and ensure that US vehicle technologies remain competitive on the international market.

Intelligent efficiency is surging: let’s talk about it;"This is not how your grandparents saved energy. They may have told you to turn off the lights or put on a sweater. They offered good advice, but times have changed beyond what they probably ever imagined. Technology is making it possible to do so much more. It gives us “intelligent efficiency,” now moving faster than ever.
Consider how smart phone apps help you navigate around traffic or smart thermostats adjust your home’s temperature automatically. They are examples of what ACEEE has dubbed “intelligent efficiency” -- the use of sensors, connected devices, data analytics, and the Internet of Things to save energy. It may be the key to scaling energy efficiency in all sectors of our economy.
As we’ll discuss at our third annual Intelligent Efficiency Conference next week in Austin, intelligent efficiency is changing how we do business. A smart thermostat, for example, asks how warm or cool you want to be, collects information from your home, accesses data in the Cloud that you didn’t even know existed, and uses that information to optimize both your comfort and energy use. You will have no more need to understand the math behind the magic than you do when you ask Google to find you a restaurant.
On a societal scale, intelligent efficiency is going to change our energy markets. Automated control of buildings will help utilities improve network reliability and efficiency. Smart thermostats will respond to demand signals to reduce the grid’s peak load, and business customers can respond to a time and locational price signal from grid operators.
Like most issues involving IT, the uses of intelligent efficiency are quickly evolving. Stakeholders across the policy spectrum are scrambling to stay on top of the latest technological developments and to understand how they will affect the energy sector. They need to ensure existing policies adapt and new policies don’t have unintended consequences.
Will changes in federal policy help or hurt?
While recent elections at the federal and state levels could impact the future of energy efficiency, advances in intelligent efficiency appear unstoppable. The private sector is creating new business models that leverage technology to track savings and monetize the social value of investing in energy efficiency.
But will the newly elected help move us forward? As we all know, policy can lead, follow, or get in the way. Let’s talk about it!
Find out what’s coming next and be part of the future at our upcoming Intelligent Efficiency Conference. While we’ll discuss these issues and the impact of the 2016 election, we’ll also give registered attendees a chance to toot their own horn. This year, we’re offering two Trading Space sessions for shameless self-promotion. We want to spur connections that lead to new research, products, services, and projects. Two of last year’s Trading Space presenters collaborated to apply for and win a Department of Energy grant. So join us and don’t get left behind.

How to create big opportunities to save energy for small businesses;"Given the importance of small businesses to our national economy, ACEEE has examined successful utility program practices in the small commercial segment. We find there are still significant energy efficiency opportunities. Our new paper describes effective program strategies.
Our findings are crucial, because as we’ve written before, small businesses are critical to the health of local economies, generating more than half of net new private sector jobs. They also occupy more than 20 billion square feet that require energy for heating, cooling, lighting, and other purposes; their square footage represents more than 30% of all commercial space. Accordingly, small businesses comprise a large market for electric and natural gas utilities.
Small business may be a hard-to-reach but not impossible-to-reach market
Despite their importance, small businesses have often been underserved by utility energy efficiency programs. According to EnergySavvy, small-to-medium commercial and industrial utility customers are the “forgotten middle.” They represent 90% of US businesses and consume about 20% of US energy, but they attract less than 4% of utility energy efficiency spending.  
Utility program managers have long considered small commercial customers difficult to reach because of participation barriers faced by small business owners, such as lack of staff, time, money, and awareness of program offerings as well as energy efficiency benefits in general.
Addressing these barriers is not always enough to persuade small business customers to participate in programs. Structural and economic limitations hinder program managers from providing programs that garner broad participation and simultaneously capture deep savings. The small business sector is diverse in terms of industry, energy uses, savings opportunities, financial needs, languages spoken, building types, and cultures. These differences have important implications for program design.
One-size-fits-all approaches remain important, but only go so far
Most small business energy efficiency programs have tried to overcome these barriers using two primary strategies. First, they provide efficient lighting measures that have wide applicability and relatively quick paybacks. Linear fluorescent and LED lamps, fixtures, and controls deliver highly cost-effective savings to almost every type of small, non-residential utility customer. Second, utilities make participation easier for customers by providing direct installation of qualified measures and high rebates or even free installation. The simple, convenient offerings save the business owner money right away.
On the other hand, many small business programs only offer lighting measures, and even among several of the most well-established programs, 90% of electric savings come from lighting. This leads to lost energy efficiency opportunities. Yet it is possible to address the diversity of small businesses with enhanced program design and to capture savings from a wider variety of energy end-uses. In small grocery stores, for example, refrigeration represents 44–57% of total electricity consumption. Even more significant, most small business programs are electric-only; they don’t provide any natural gas savings measures for space heating, water heating, or cooking. 
ACEEE sought to find out what leading programs have been doing to enhance performance. We found emerging trends that may bear fruit in the future as well as program designs and features that are already delivering results.
If I’m a program administrator, how can I reach more customers?
Many of the successful practices embody a shift toward a more customized and customer-centric model. Here’s what we recommend:
Segment the market and provide customized offerings for each sub-segment
Tailor and target marketing and communications to provide personalized and relevant messages
Offer zero-interest or low-interest financing to encourage comprehensive retrofits and deeper savings
Offer a wide set of eligible measures, for multiple end-uses, based on target market research and data analytics
Provide dedicated project managers to give customers direct technical assistance, education, and support on energy efficiency
Establish partnerships with an area’s Chamber of Commerce, small business advocacy organizations, and community groups that can provide access to more commercial customers and engage them as trusted local partners

The Clean Power Plan and energy efficiency: where do we go from here?;"As another round of global climate talks has concluded, many observers wonder whether the 2016 election means the end of greenhouse gas regulation in the United States. More specifically, what happens to the Clean Power Plan?
Even before the election, the Clean Power Plan was already years away from being finalized. Implementation of the rule is currently stayed as it moves through the courts. Even if it sails through the courts unscathed and the original compliance schedule remains in effect, states would not have to meet their first targets for curbing power plant emissions until two years after the next presidential election (2022).
When it comes to environmental regulation, it’s best to take the long view. Rulemakings made pursuant to authority under the Clean Air Act are generally litigated and take years to develop. They often span across multiple administrations. Take the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, the Environmental Protection Agency program to limit emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide. It took decades to evolve. There were multiple years when the EPA didn’t act or the rulemaking just sat in courts.
If the question is: Will we implement a final rule called the CPP? Probably not, but the Supreme Court and the Clean Air Act require the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from existing power plants. How a Donald Trump administration might navigate this issue is an open question with multiple potential paths. Here at ACEEE, the Clean Power Plan has been a major area of focus, but not for the reasons you might think. 
The Clean Power Plan never contained any requirements for energy efficiency. Yet it shined a spotlight on energy efficiency and its effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It was a very visible effort that got people thinking about energy efficiency because of its health and environmental benefits. It sparked conversations between utility regulators and air regulators in states—some of whom had never considered the emissions reductions they had been achieving through existing energy efficiency programs. I feel fairly confident in saying that either the prominent role of energy efficiency in reducing greenhouse gas emissions wasn’t well understood, or the policy mechanisms and tools for implementing such efficiency weren’t well understood.
The work that needs to be done has never been about a single rulemaking. All of the health and environmental benefits that come with energy efficiency are still possible, with or without the Clean Power Plan. Energy efficiency has always been here, and it will remain vital for our health, economy, and infrastructure resiliency. Furthermore, states will continue to bear the primary responsibility for protecting public health. The Clean Power Plan was designed to reflect a direction in which the states were already heading. Data from the Energy Information Administration shows that even without the rulemaking, greenhouse gas reductions from the power sector have been steadily declining. States are already reducing greenhouse gases and using energy efficiency to create jobs, improve housing, and protect the safety and security of low-income and fixed-income families.
We’ll see what happens with the Clean Power Plan, but in the meantime, we can move ahead with good policies that can be implemented with ‘no regrets’ during this period of regulatory uncertainty. States and cities can create jobs, reduce energy costs, and position themselves for a competitive advantage with energy efficiency. Whether you’re Republican or Democrat, wealthy or financially struggling, saving energy is a good idea.

How residential utility programs could reach more diverse households;"Many energy efficiency programs are designed around measures rather than people. These “untargeted” programs focus on meeting energy savings and cost-effectiveness goals, and are ostensibly impartial about the characteristics of the households that receive the offering.
Our new examination of program demographics shows how, in practice, untargeted programs often limit participant diversity. We reviewed every residential program evaluation in California for the 2010-2012 program cycle, and found participants in some of the biggest programs were substantially less diverse than the population. Energy Upgrade California (EUC) and Home Energy Efficiency Rebate (HEER) program participants, for example, were more likely to be white, upper income, college educated, or English speakers.
We explain these findings, and point the way toward greater equity and diversity in participation, by drawing on a categorization scheme for social programs and identifying three program design elements that influence participant diversity.
Three reasons why program participants may not look like the general population
1. Buy-in cost: the amount a household is required to spend in order to participate.
The buy-in cost for efficiency programs ranges from a US average of $6,000 for a home energy retrofit, to $500-$3,000 for an energy-efficient appliance, to -$50 for refrigerator recycling (the program pays the participant).
Our data show that a high buy-in cost correlates with a less diverse participant population. Participants in programs with the highest buy-in costs, EUC and HEER, were less diverse than California’s general population. Participants in the program with the lowest buy-in cost, refrigerator recycling, looked almost exactly like the population. Figure 1 shows the income distribution of participants in three programs: EUC, HEER, and refrigerator recycling, compared to California’s general population.
* Some EUC program evaluations did not report incremental income data for participants with incomes under $100,000.
A natural experiment during the study period provides another illustration of the relationship between buy-in cost and participant demographics. For several months during the 2010-2012 program cycle, the availability of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding doubled the financial incentives for the EUC program. Households that participated when incentives were higher (and presumably their out-of-pocket cost was lower) had lower incomes, lower home values, and were more likely to live inland.
2. Outreach and marketing: the language, format, and channel through which program information is communicated.
The language in which a program communicates to participants is an important determinant of participant diversity. Nearly 40% of Californians say their primary language is something other than English. But California’s biggest-budget efficiency programs communicated nearly all program information in English, and most evaluation surveys were conducted in English.
Efficiency programs that communicated in languages other than English succeeded in reaching more diverse populations. Figure 2 shows the income distribution and race/ethnicity of participants in the Community Language Education and Outreach (CLEO) program, which provided energy efficiency information in Asian languages and Spanish.  
3. Implementation method: the many ways in which a program can be delivered
Program designers face an overwhelming number of options when it comes to program implementation, and their choices influence participant diversity. The best example from our data set is an experimentally designed pilot program for refrigerator recycling. When big box retailers implemented the program, participants had higher incomes, larger homes, and recycled newer, larger, side-by-side refrigerators, compared to participants in a utility-run program.
There are many research opportunities to explore the relationship between implementation approach and participant diversity. Our data only allowed us to begin to address questions about the demographic impact of choices, like in-person vs. online education.
Calls to action
There is a critical need for evaluators to consistently collect, report, and analyze demographic data. Nearly one-third of the evaluations we reviewed did not collect participant demographic data. Even among evaluations that did collect demographics, nearly one-third did not publish those data. And only a quarter of evaluations used demographics to analyze program performance.
Program administrators, designers, and implementers can play a key role in increasing participant diversity by using demographic data to identify underserved populations, assess their barriers to participation, and design programs to meet their unique needs. A recent ACEEE report provides information on best practices for reaching diverse participants in the multifamily sector.
Policy makers, too, can use participant demographic data as a resource to establish diversity goals for efficiency program portfolios. And future research should expand the investigation of participant diversity to programs in other regions of the country.

What do the 2016 election results mean for energy efficiency?;"Now that the hard-fought 2016 election is over, I think it is useful to consider its impact on energy efficiency policy. No doubt, a lot of uncertainty remains because of President-elect Donald Trump’s lack of specificity on many issues. Yet given the bipartisan, good-for-business appeal of energy efficiency, I see potential paths forward and work to be done. Of course, we also need to be ready to defend against legislative or administrative attempts to roll back current energy efficiency policies, programs, and funding, which could wipe out the major energy bill savings, job growth, and health benefits that we have achieved.
President-elect Trump has said very little about energy efficiency, so what happens in a Trump administration is likely to depend on his senior appointments, such as the new secretary of energy and the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump has spoken a bit about climate change, which he called a hoax created by the Chinese to suppress the US economy (although he’s tempered these comments more recently). He’s pledged to end the Clean Power Plan and to withdraw from the Paris climate change treaty. To change either of these could well require a multiyear process but he might do little to follow through on either one and essentially let them be unimplemented. And years ago, he said green buildings have not been perfected yet and that it takes 40 years to get your money back, but he also noted that this could get better with technology (see here).
Potential Opportunities
Despite these comments, there may be opportunities for progress. In his victory speech, Trump pledged to increase infrastructure spending. Energy efficiency could be part of that. An infrastructure package could include investments in transportation, water systems, high-speed Internet, and a smart grid, all of which can contribute to economic growth and efficiency. Another possible place for action is tax reform, a very high priority of House Speaker Paul Ryan. While tax reform will primarily focus on tax rates and tax simplification, some energy efficiency provisions might be included, such as overhauling commercial depreciation rules that discourage investments in commercial equipment and changing energy efficiency tax credits so they are performance-based and phase out when markets are transformed (ACEEE is working on both of these issues – see here). And if energy legislation does not pass this year (currently a House-Senate conference committee is working to resolve differences between House- and Senate-passed bills), energy legislation could return next year.
There may also be a few market-oriented areas of opportunity including:
Work to promote “smart” technologies including smart buildings, manufacturing, transportation, cities, and the grid.  As documented by ACEEE, there are large opportunities in these areas, and the US can be a world leader.
Work on energy use benchmarking and transparency to better inform home and building owners about their energy consumption and unleash the power of the market on strategies to reduce this use.  This might include making energy use data more accessible to consumers and to vendors they authorize to evaluate their data.
Work on financing for energy efficiency, including its role in the mortgage process and financing for retrofits.
Work on a private-public financial mechanism known as energy savings performance contracts that are budget neutral and produce significant energy savings, especially in institutional facilities.
While the focus of this blog post is national policy, the election also affected governors in several states. With Washington likely to do less on energy efficiency, more of the focus for positive gains will switch to the state and local level. The biggest change may happen in North Carolina where the current governor, Pat McCrory, has not been especially supportive of energy efficiency. He appears to have lost his re-election bid by a razor-thin margin, and Governor-elect Roy Cooper is expected to be more supportive of energy efficiency. However, he’ll have to work with a Republican legislature. In addition to North Carolina, the governor’s mansion is switching control in three other states: Vermont, New Hampshire, and Missouri. The new governors in Vermont and New Hampshire probably will not change energy efficiency policy very much. We don’t know much about the new governor of Missouri. In 2016, governors were elected in 12 states; two seats come up in 2017 (New Jersey and Virginia) and the remaining 36 are up in 2018. We also note that Senator Rob Portman’s double-digit victory in Ohio is a strong vote for a moderate Republican in the state, and will hopefully encourage Ohio Governor John Kasich to continue to hold firm against proposals that weaken energy efficiency policy there. ACEEE has worked with Senator Portman on energy efficiency issues for many years.
These are emerging thoughts, and I’m sure the landscape will evolve more as President-elect Trump and other incoming elected officials shape their agendas. ACEEE will keep an eye on these developments and will blog again on these topics once agendas become clearer.

Our new guide helps separate the Pikachus from the Digletts of energy efficiency behavior-change programs;"In the energy efficiency world, programs that reduce energy use by targeting human behavior are relatively few, but proliferating quickly. In 2013, some US states claimed as much as 28% of their energy efficiency savings from behavior change programs. Like Pokémon Go characters in the wild, some behavior change programs are common, well-known, and seen everywhere. Others are rare and largely unknown. Still others are rarely seen but hold great potential. Utility program administrators may be familiar with a few of these programs, but an expert guide can help identify others and explain the best methods for capturing, collecting and using all of them. A new ACEEE report provides a thorough guide for understanding the world of energy efficiency behavior change programs, and why they work.
Home Energy Reports, the Diglett of behavior change programs
By far, the most common behavior change program implemented by utility program administrators are home energy reports (HERs) that feature social comparison information. These programs reduce energy consumption by giving residents reports on their energy use every one to four months (in addition to their monthly energy bills). The reports tell residents how much energy they used in comparison to similar homes in their region and include tips on how to reduce energy consumption. HERs have been implemented by utilities since 2008 and consistently reduce electricity use by about 1-2% (and gas by roughly 0.5-1%) by the end of their second year. The ACEEE report summarizes 30 such programs that were evaluated since 2013, and examines questions such as: How long do savings persist? Should HERs be delivered by paper or email? Should participants be automatically enrolled? How frequently should HERs be delivered? Like Diglett, these programs are common and well known. They play a significant role in shaping the landscape of behavior programs.
Games and competitions, the Pikachu of behavior change programs
For those interested in slightly more exotic behavior change programs, there are games and competitions. These proliferating programs are becoming the go-to-strategy for utilities and third parties interested in reducing energy consumption through behavior change. Like a rare Pikachu in the wild, they are quick, but their stamina (HP) is unknown. Though they can effectively change behavior, more needs to be learned about their long-term effectiveness. Utilities have implemented competitions between individuals, businesses, buildings, neighborhoods or even cities. For example, a series of competitions between commercial offices in Northwest USA resulted in 2-6% electricity reduction. Games such as Cool Choices make saving energy within a workplace fun and, in the process, reduce electricity consumption by as much as 6.6%. However, games and competitions can’t last forever. They motivate participants to save energy by rewarding the highest achievement when the event is complete. Although initial research suggests that energy savings likely persist after the end of the program, more data is needed.
Education Programs in K-12 Schools, Dragonite or Mew?
Education programs in K-12 schools frequently claim that they can reduce electricity use by 20% or more, but their methods of evaluation are usually weak or unknown. As such, these may be rare and powerful Dragonite-like programs, or they may continue to be mysterious Mew-type programs. More research is required to determine their true impact and long-term effectiveness.
Capture difficulty: Which social science strategies make behavior change programs effective?
Behavior change programs may work in different ways, but they all benefit from integrating research on psychology and human behavior. For example, community-based programs sometimes solicit pledges from homeowners to reduce their energy consumption. This element is effective because research shows that people who make public commitments to energy savings are more likely to take action than those who make private commitments or no commitments at all. According to one meta-analysis, the most effective strategy may be to use an energy champion or leader with a social network to promote the behavior change. Volunteer leaders or trusted messengers are effective at changing the behavior of their friends, family, co-workers, or community members, because they are trustworthy and credible, and because they can exert a degree of social pressure. Including this element can strengthen most group-based efforts such as competitions, education programs or strategic energy management. Public commitment and energy champions are just two of many tested strategies that make behavior change programs effective.
Feeling lost?
For those wanting to navigate the energy-behavior wilderness or nurture their own behavior change programs to maturity, the ACEEE guide to Behavior Change Programs: Status and Impact picks up where the 2013 Field Guide to Behavior Change Programs left off. There are many behavior change programs out there, each ranging in effectiveness and applicability. This guide helps to identify a variety of programs, from common to rare.

EPA Urged to Level the Playing Field for Energy Efficiency in the Clean Power Plan;"More Than 50 Groups Join ACEEE in Clean Energy Incentive Plan Proposal
Washington, D.C.—A diverse alliance is calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to expand incentives for energy efficiency in the Clean Power Plan. Led by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), it argues that energy efficiency should receive access to the same credits as renewable energy through the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP). The CPP’s early-action program, as currently drafted, puts efficiency at a disadvantage. 
“Recognizing the importance of the CEIP as an opportunity to spur early investment in low-cost emission reduction strategies, we recommend that the Renewable Energy Reserve (RER) be expanded to include energy efficiency policies and measures,” states the letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. Signatories include a broad array of businesses, policymakers, localities, environmental groups, health advocates, and faith communities.
The CEIP rewards early investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects that serve low-income communities. It offers an extra incentive to renewable energy, and the alliance requests that the EPA also include energy efficiency in this pool of credits.
“Energy efficiency is generally the least-cost option for states looking to comply with the Clean Power Plan, but efficiency is not yet being fully considered as a strategy for the Clean Energy Incentive Plan,” said Steven Nadel, executive director, ACEEE. “The Environmental Protection Agency should expand the pool of credits available to renewable energy to also include energy efficiency, which would help control electric costs and keep money in the hands of communities.”
“The Clean Power Plan goes far beyond protecting our climate, because decreased air pollution will have powerful benefits for public health,” said Catherine Thomasson, MD, executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility. “By encouraging energy efficiency, the Clean Energy Incentive Program will help decrease the power sector's reliance on fossil fuels—which decreases the particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and other harmful air pollution created by burning fossil fuels.”
“Children and local communities are why, as Christians, we care about the Clean Power Plan,” said Reverend Mitchell C. Hescox, president/C.E.O. of The Evangelical Environmental Network. “We believe that a clean energy future, which includes expanding energy efficiency and cutting pollution, profoundly impacts human life.”
The proposal requests that EPA treat energy efficiency as equal to renewable energy in the CEIP. The exclusion of energy efficiency is a significant oversight that could cause states to opt for more expensive compliance options.
Reducing emissions through energy efficiency costs significantly less than other means. These savings get passed down to customers, resulting in local job creation and economic development. The EPA’s latest proposal for the CEIP is an important opportunity to ensure that states can reward investments in energy efficiency while getting credit for the pollution it avoids.
Simply put, ACEEE and partners are seeking to put energy efficiency on a level playing field with renewable energy. To read the letter, visit: http://aceee.org/regulatory-filing/ceip-letter-091516

New research shows Michigan could actually profit from Clean Power Plan compliance;"My home state of Michigan recently released two reports summarizing how Michigan could comply with EPA’s Clean Power Plan requirements.  As has been the case with numerous other analyses, they found energy efficiency to be a core strategy for reducing the total costs of Clean Power Plan (CPP) compliance.  In fact, the modeling showed energy efficiency would help Michigan achieve excess carbon credits, which could be sold to other states. As a result, a Michigan compliance plan would cost less than a “business as usual” future with no CPP policy at all!
Setting efficiency targets pays off in Michigan
The importance of energy efficiency was emphasized by the executive director of the Michigan Agency for Energy, Valerie Brader.  She noted that expanding Michigan’s utility energy efficiency programs beyond the current statutory 1% annual savings requirement “is absolutely key to our energy future”, and would result in lower total costs to ratepayers than a business as usual path.  She added: “This is absolutely vital to control Michigan’s energy costs in the future.  It is saving us literally billions of dollars.”
While Michigan is officially “pencils down” in terms of working on CPP issues, until the courts lift the current ‘stay’, they did allow some modeling work that had been previously contracted-for to proceed to completion.  These results should be very helpful in guiding policy when CPP planning resumes.
Among the key findings were analyses which showed that doubling the state’s Energy Efficiency Resource Standard for utilities from 1% annual savings to 2% would produce net savings of an additional $900 million compared to a compliance plan with the current 1% standard. The modeling results also revealed that using a mass-based approach and engaging in interstate trading (to sell excess credits) would be the most advantageous path for Michigan.
Resources to get started in your state
The final Clean Power Plan rule makes it clear that energy efficiency has a big role to play to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ACEEE has done extensive work examining the implications of using energy efficiency as a Clean Power Plan compliance approach and consistently finds opportunity for efficiency to eliminate pollution at a lower cost than the alternatives. Tools such as ACEEE’s SUPR calculator and Synapse’s CP3T are free and can provide states with a first look at the role energy efficiency can play in different states.
Michigan’s new analyses tell us what we at ACEEE know to be true for most states: energy efficiency puts the state in an excellent position to adopt a compliance approach that improves both the state economy and citizen health through reduced pollution. We hope that policymakers and regulators take notice of how effective and beneficial energy efficiency can be in achieving Clean Power Plan compliance.

Here’s how we scale up participation and savings in residential retrofits;"Our existing housing stock is an underutilized energy efficiency resource. We’ve only scratched the surface of its potential to save energy. Decades of research and thousands of retrofits show that even the most basic home retrofits can cut energy use by 15-20% while more comprehensive retrofit projects can double or even triple the energy savings. Residents benefit not only from lower energy bills, but also from improved comfort, better health, and safer, more durable homes. Despite the widely-documented benefits of whole home retrofits, demand for retrofits lags.
Approximately 518,000 retrofit projects were completed through the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR program from 2002-2015, according to DOE.  Add to that the roughly 115,000 homes retrofit through the Better Buildings Neighborhood Program and the total number of home performance retrofits completed through the leading program efforts approaches 700,000—less than 1% of US single-family homes. While this number doesn’t include retrofits completed outside of programs or those conducted through weatherization efforts targeted to low- and moderate-income households, it does illustrate the need to scale up retrofit activity to capture the energy savings available.  
How to meet challenges and expand retrofits
Our new report explores some of the lingering challenges facing residential retrofit programs as well as strategies for growing participation while delivering anticipated savings. We include examples of current programs that use these strategies for better results.  Specific challenges include: (1) calculating accurate project-level savings estimates, (2) ensuring that upgrades are installed and perform as expected, and (3) encouraging public buy-in and participation in programs. All of these factors affect a program’s ability to realize savings.
New technologies, practices, and program features represent opportunities to improve outcomes.  Already gaining traction in retrofit programs are data standardization, calibration of energy models to actual energy use, and real-time program evaluation---all strategies that help improve project-level realization rates. Emerging opportunities include leveraging the capabilities of smart technologies (e.g., smart thermostats and home energy management systems), expanded focus on HVAC system measurement and verification, and potentially, the inclusion of pay-for-performance incentives.
Programs can play an important role in growing consumer demand for home performance work. They can improve systems and practices that enable contractors to perform quality work and, at the same, boost energy savings. More accurate, reliable realization of savings at the project level opens up more opportunities to use financing strategies that are tied to energy savings, such as pay-as-you-save or on-bill financing. This can also enable better integration of energy efficiency improvements with other home maintenance and renovation projects, such as roofing or siding replacement. By seizing these opportunities, retrofit program providers can help residents gain all benefits of more energy-efficient homes.

California Golden Again on Energy Efficiency, Regains #1-State Spot in Tie with 6-Time Winner Massachusetts;"10thAnniversary Energy Efficiency Scorecard Shows VT, RI, CT, NY Rounding Out Top 5; MO, ME, and MI are 3 Most Improved States; LA, KS, SD, WY, and ND at Bottom and Most in Need of Improvement
Washington, DC—In a dramatic photo finish, California and Massachusetts both won the top spot in the 10th edition of the 2016 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard published by the ACEEE. This marks Massachusetts’s sixth consecutive year in first place, but the first time it shared the Spotlight with the Golden State, which last held the title in 2010. The balance of the top 10 consisted of Vermont (#3), Rhode Island (#4), Connecticut and New York (tied for #5), Oregon (#7), Washington state (#8), Maryland (#9), and Minnesota (#10).
The three most improved states are Missouri, Maine, and Michigan. The ACEEE State Scorecard identifies the following states as most in need of improvement:  Louisiana (#47); Kansas (#48); South Dakota (#49), Wyoming (#50), and North Dakota (#51). 
Steven Nadel, executive director, ACEEE, said: “Governors, legislators, regulators, businesses, and citizens are increasingly recognizing that energy efficiency is a critical state resource that keeps money in the local economy. The past year has been an exciting time for energy efficiency, with several states strengthening efficiency policies and programs. States are spurring efficiency investment through advancements in building energy codes, transportation planning, and leading by example in their own facilities and fleets. These investments reap large benefits, giving businesses, governments, and consumers more control over how and when they use energy.”
Jay Nixon, governor of Missouri, said: “Missouri is proud to be among the most improved states for energy efficiency this year. Our state energy plan recognizes the vital role that energy efficiency plays in helping Missouri citizens and businesses manage their budgets. Going forward, Missouri will continue to work towards a more sustainable and secure energy future and create next-generation jobs in this fast-growing industry.”
Kathleen Hogan, deputy assistant secretary for energy efficiency, US Department of Energy (DOE), said: “States oversee many policies and programs that unlock efficiency’s many benefits—economic competitiveness, more jobs, an improved environment. The Scorecard shows states are diving deeper, pushing further, innovating, and making tremendous progress on efficiency.”
Andrew McAllister, commissioner, California Energy Commission, said: “To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from building energy consumption, California’s highest priority is energy efficiency. California continues to prove that using energy wisely is good for both the economy and the environment. A robust and growing clean energy economy enables real people to understand and choose between attractive options that improve their lives and achieve deep energy savings. With the right public-private cooperation and partnerships, we expect even greater things ahead.”
Judith Judson, commissioner of the Department of Energy Resources, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, said: “The Baker-Polito Administration is committed to supporting energy efficiency policies, which are consistently proven to be the most cost effective way to reduce ratepayer costs and lower emissions. By working with our utility partners, the Commonwealth’s ratepayers continue to realize billions of dollars in benefits from our nation-leading energy efficiency policies and programs.”
OTHER KEY FINDINGS
The 2016 ACEEE State Scorecard zeroes in on six policy areas in which states pursue energy efficiency: utility and public benefits programs and policies; transportation policies; building energy codes; combined heat and power (CHP) policies; state government–led initiatives around energy efficiency; and appliance and equipment standards. Here are the leaders in each category:
Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Vermont are the top states in utility-sector energy efficiency programs and policies. A total of 26 states enforce and adequately fund energy savings targets to drive investments in utility-sector energy efficiency programs. The states with the most ambitious targets include Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Arizona. New Hampshire is the most recent state to adopt energy savings goals for its utilities.
California, Massachusetts, and New York are out in front on energy-efficient transportation policies. California’s requirements for reducing greenhouse gas emissions have prompted several strategies for smart growth. Massachusetts promoted smart growth development in cities and municipalities through state-delivered financial incentives. New York is one of the few states in the nation to have a vehicle-miles-traveled reduction target.
Several states—including Massachusetts, New York, Texas, Vermont, and Washington—join California and Illinois in achieving top scores for building energy codes and compliance this year. A growing number of states have taken major steps toward the adoption of the most recent DOE-certified codes for both residential and commercial new construction. These include Alabama, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Washington.
Massachusetts, Maryland, and California score highest for their combined heat and power policies.
California, Washington, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and Tennessee set the pace in state government-focused initiatives.  
California continues to lead the nation in setting appliance standards, having adopted standards for more than 100 products. Within the past year, it became the first state to adopt standards for LEDs and small-diameter directional lamps, and it also updated its standards for HVAC air filters, fluorescent dimming ballasts, and heat pump water chilling packages.
States continue to be standouts in other regards when it comes to energy efficiency. New York posted an increase in electricity savings. Earlier in the year, the Empire State also completed major updates to its state building energy codes. Utah and Tennessee made similar gains thanks to updates to state building energy codes this year. Arkansas committed to extend its energy efficiency goals and gained points for state government-led policies, having recently closed its first commercial PACE project.
Weston Berg, research analyst and lead State Scorecard author, ACEEE, said:  “Over the last 10 years, we have seen that many if not most innovative policies and programs that promote energy efficiency originate at the state level. As a cost-effective compliance option, efficiency is a valuable addition to any state’s policy toolkit, saving money, driving investment across all sectors of the economy, creating jobs, and reducing the environmental impact of energy use.”
METHODOLOGY
ACEEE allocated 50 possible points to states among policy areas: 20 points to utility and public benefits program and policy metrics; 10 points for transportation policies and programs; seven points to building energy codes; four points to improved CHP policies; seven points for state government-led initiatives; and two points going to state appliance and equipment standards.

Solar and energy efficiency need to work together like peanut butter and jelly;"Energy efficiency and solar advocates have on occasion butted heads over which option should be implemented in homes and buildings first and how much should be installed before the other is considered. Here at ACEEE we believe that, like market solutions vs. energy efficiency programs, this is a false choice. Both are valuable and can, and should, work together as an integrated solution to create cleaner and cheaper energy. While energy efficiency is just as clean as solar when it comes to emissions, efficiency by itself can’t produce energy for customers looking for a clean energy option, and solar without energy efficiency can’t reach the full extent of its potential.
However, in recent years, some solar companies and some consumers have been employing a solar-first strategy in the residential sector—installing solar systems without paying much attention to energy efficiency. This strategy has been spurred in part by substantial solar tax credits, net-metering rules in place in most states, and the availability of solar financing that reduces or even eliminates the initial purchase price, replacing the up-front cost with monthly payments that extend over many years. 
Despite these incentives, it still generally makes sense to implement as much efficiency as possible when installing generation. To look more closely at this issue, we conducted two illustrative analyses. The first compares the cost per kWh produced or saved from solar and energy efficiency when done individually or together. The second compares solar technical potential and residential electricity use, with and without efficiency. We find that when efficiency and solar are implemented in tandem, costs are lower, and solar can meet a larger share of residential loads.
Cost per kWh
For this comparison, we looked at the average cost per kWh produced from a typical solar system today, the average cost per kWh from residential energy efficiency, and the cost per kWh when efficiency and solar are done together.  Our results are summarized in the table below. A solar system costs about 17-23 cents per kWh produced (the low-end estimate is based on very sunny Las Vegas, the high-end on Washington, DC). Energy efficiency costs less—about 8 cents per kWh. But when solar and efficiency are combined, the cost is 3-6 cents less per kWh than solar alone. Energy efficiency has a lower cost, and it also reduces the size and cost of the needed solar system. PB&J (solar and efficiency) is less expensive than PB (solar) alone.
This analysis ignores the federal 30% solar tax credit and also ignores utility incentives that are commonly available for energy efficiency measures. If tax credits and incentives are included, the overall result is still generally the same—a combined approach is less expensive per kWh than solar alone. This is just a simple analysis for typical measures and hence is only useful as a rough approximation.
Solar production relative to residential electricity use
For this analysis, we compared estimates of the technical potential for rooftop solar systems in each state (as estimated in a GIS-based analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) with residential electricity use (from the most recent EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey or RECS). We looked for states where the solar technical potential in the residential sector was at least 50% of current residential consumption, or of residential consumption if energy efficiency were to reduce consumption by an average of 30%. 
Our analysis only covers 24 states, as those are the states with detailed data in RECS at the single- or two-state level. Results of our analysis are shown in the map below. With efficiency, 23 out of the 24 states could hit the 50% solar threshold, including six reaching 75% solar (California, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Nevada). Without energy efficiency, only nine of the 24 states could meet at least half of the residential load with rooftop solar. Only in two states (California and Colorado) does solar potential exceed 75% of residential consumption. In other words, solar can meet a much larger proportion of residential loads if efficiency is included.  
This analysis doesn’t include potential growth in electric loads such as from increased use of electric vehicles, or conversion of gas and oil space- and water-heating systems to heat pumps. Details of our analysis, including a case where all gas and oil space-heating systems are converted to heat pumps can be found here. In this alternative case, only two states meet the 50% threshold without efficiency, while 12 states meet the threshold with efficiency. 
As with our first analysis, this is a rough analysis that assumes all of the solar potential is achieved and that all homes implement energy efficiency. Also, this simple analysis ignores the fact that some homes can produce more solar power than they use while other homes are not suitable for solar, such as those heavily shaded by trees or that do not face south. This analysis should be considered a yardstick and not a definitive analysis.
Conclusion
Energy efficiency will generally be less expensive per kWh than solar. And by lowering consumption, energy efficiency will stretch the available rooftop solar resource farther, allowing solar to serve a higher percent of residential consumption while also allowing a smaller and less expensive solar system.  These are two simple analyses but they make a clear case that jelly (efficiency) is needed to help peanut butter (solar) do its best.

Energy efficiency should be placed on a level playing field in the Clean Energy Incentive Program;"Despite the fact that energy efficiency is generally the least-cost option for states looking to comply with the Clean Power Plan, it has yet to be fully considered as a strategy for the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP). This could result in reduced investment in energy efficiency which would mean increased electric costs and less money in the hands of communities. As we’ve shown, it costs significantly less to reduce emissions through energy efficiency than through other means. These savings get passed down to customers, resulting in local job creation and economic development. The Environmental Protection Agency’s latest proposal for the CEIP is an important opportunity to ensure that states can reward investments in energy efficiency while claiming credit for the pollution it avoids. The CEIP early-action program incentivizes renewable energy and energy efficiency serving low-income communities, but as currently drafted, it puts efficiency at an unfair disadvantage. Earlier today ACEEE submitted comments to the EPA that seek to put energy efficiency on a level playing field.  
The CEIP is expected to spur early investment in clean energy and provides benefits to low-income communities. In addition to rewarding early investments in energy efficiency and solar projects implemented in low-income communities, the CEIP offers an extra incentive to renewable energy. While we support many elements of EPA’s recent proposal, we are requesting that EPA expand this pool of credits available to renewable energy to also include energy efficiency.
We think this point is so important that we’ve created a letter for sign-on that requests EPA to treat energy efficiency as equal to renewable energy in the CEIP. The exclusion of energy efficiency is a significant oversight that could cause states to opt for more expensive compliance options. We’ve received broad support for this idea from businesses, policymakers, localities, health advocates, environmental groups, and others. Now is the time to show your support and put efficiency on a level playing field in the CEIP. If you would like to add your organization in support of this letter, please contact Aileo Weinmann of Resource Media at aileo@resource-media.org.
ACEEE’s broader comments also recommend an increased incentive for residential efficiency and solar projects implemented in low-income households. We think the current award is not enough to drive the significant investment needed in these communities. Increasing the incentive will help to ensure that residential projects are a major component of the CEIP and that low-income households can directly participate and benefit from this program. We also request that EPA recognize the full benefits of combined heat and power (CHP) installed at critical facilities and other public buildings in low-income communities, and include it as an eligible technology under the CEIP. We support having EPA create a presumptively approvable CEIP plan for states to follow, and request that EPA provide clear guidance to states for evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) to award efficiency savings.

Studies suggest that past rates of energy efficiency improvement can be sustained;"Can efficiency improvements achieved in past decades be sustained in the future?  How much impact does the rebound effect have on energy efficiency potential out to 2030, or even 2050? To answer these questions, I was invited to write a paper entitled The Potential for Additional Energy Efficiency Savings Including How the Rebound Effect Could Affect This Potential. The paper appears in the current issue of Current Sustainable/Renewable Energy Report (September 2016), an academic journal published by Springer. A PDF of the paper can be accessed here.
Energy savings potential past and future
The paper discusses energy efficiency achievements in several countries over the past several decades and finds that energy efficiency improvements have reduced energy use by 0.6-2.0 % per year, varying by country and period studied. The paper then reviews a variety of recent studies that estimate how much energy efficiency potential remains, looking at studies that estimate efficiency potential out to at least 2030 and, in multiple cases, out to 2050.
Based on this analysis, as well as past accomplishments, I find that compound energy efficiency savings of 1.0–1.4% per year appear to be feasible, and savings of 2.0–2.6% per year might be possible, but have been infrequently demonstrated in practice. By and large, these estimates of potential future savings do not include rebound effects, although estimates of past efficiency improvements do generally include rebound effects.
How rebound effects savings estimates
The paper summarizes a variety of studies that look at direct and indirect rebound effects. (Direct rebound is the impact of a purchase of an efficient product on the purchaser’s use of that product; indirect rebound reflects upstream impacts such as the impact of re-spending money saved on energy bills.) From this review, I find that direct and indirect rebound effects are generally each in the range of 10–20% of savings; therefore total rebound typically is in the 20–30% range.
Putting it all together—how much future savings are possible?
If we reduce the estimates of future energy efficiency potential to account for direct and indirect rebound, at a minimum it appears that recent rates of energy efficiency improvement can be sustained for many years. Some studies suggest that even higher rates of energy efficiency improvement might be achieved, but for the most part, these levels of savings have not yet been achieved in practice.  Still, given objectives of fostering economic growth and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, striving to take efficiency improvements to a new level is a worthy objective.

Expanding the energy efficiency toolbox through green banks;"There are many tried-and-true tools in the energy efficiency toolbox. Programs in the utility sector that offer customers a variety of rebates, incentives, and technical services totaled more than $7 billion in 2014. In the private market, energy service performance contracts totaled more than $4 billion. And state energy offices loaned more than $74 million in revolving loans.
While these investments have led to substantial energy savings, there’s still enormous potential. One study estimated that more than $279 billion could be invested in energy efficiency retrofits and upgrades in commercial, residential, and institutional markets in the United States, resulting in more than $1 trillion of energy savings over 10 years. But getting there may require expanding our toolbox. Green banks are one strategy gaining more attention from states and local governments.
In a new report from ACEEE, we review the progress of six green banks and four additional financing entities that serve similar functions. Our goals were to understand how green banks are working in specific market sectors and to identify promising strategies and lessons learned, with a particular focus on energy efficiency. If more states are looking to green banks to stretch public dollars, fill market gaps, and ramp up clean energy investment, we want to know how the early results and lessons learned can shape the next round of green bank deployment.
What is a green bank?
There is no one established definition of a green bank. Green banks are typically created by state and local governments to address the barriers faced by consumers and lenders in financing clean energy projects and environmentally beneficial technologies. They take many shapes, but in general, green banks share the following key features:
They are publicly chartered financing institutions.
They have a mandate to invest in clean energy deployment.
They leverage public funds to stimulate private capital.
They offer products across sectors, focusing on bridging market gaps.
What do the data show?
We reviewed current and planned portfolios of green banks to better understand their role in catalyzing energy efficiency projects. Many of these institutions are in the early stages of planning or deployment, so data are limited. However, we did find some interesting results. Here are just a few:
Nearly all of the green banks we reviewed invest in both renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, or they have plans to expand portfolio offerings to cover both. However, established green banks like Connecticut Green Bank tend to have portfolios that lean heavily toward renewable energy projects, suggesting opportunity remains for investing in efficiency. Furthermore, we found relatively few projects combining energy efficiency and renewables.
Data on energy savings are less commonly available. For green banks that were able to report them, statewide incremental energy savings amounted to less than 0.01% of statewide electricity sales. The limited size of these energy savings reflects the relative newness of green banks, with many programs not yet reaching full scale.
Partnerships can be the key to success. We found that most green banks work in tandem with utility-administered programs, leveraging ratepayer-funded programs to achieve deeper energy savings.
What does the future hold?
Green banks are still relatively new, and there is significant opportunity to expand and refine program offerings. Green banks have ambitious goals of deploying clean energy technologies and delivering energy savings. But to better understand the current and potential impact of green banks, we need better data. Several green banks are taking the lead in developing thorough tracking and evaluation metrics that will help us better understand the role green banks play in the marketplace.
Green banks show promise in several states, and we expect that more states will consider whether a green bank is the right fit for them in the future. But they are not the only strategy to provide streamlined clean energy to customers, and several states have chosen to fill market gaps by leveraging an array of existing programs and services. Ultimately, whether states choose to develop green banks or deploy clean energy resources in other ways, partnerships and integration of services will be the most important tool for breaking down market barriers.

The good, better, and best of the Phase 2 heavy-duty vehicle standards;"Heavy-duty vehicle fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards are a signature program of the Obama administration, initially adopted in 2011. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) adopted a second phase of the program last month, built on the success of the Phase 1 program. Phases 1 and 2 together will reduce fuel consumption of new heavy-duty vehicles by 25-48%, depending on vehicle type, between model years 2010 and 2027.
The good: Major efficiency gains for tractor-trailers
Tractor-trailers are the biggest fuel users among heavy-duty vehicles, responsible for two-thirds of heavy-duty oil consumption. Therefore, getting major fuel efficiency gains from tractor-trailers is key to an effective program. Long-haul tractor trucks are good candidates for rapid uptake of new technologies due to their high fuel consumption and high mileage—more than 100,000 annual miles for their first several years on the road. Clearly, fuel efficiency investment pays back quickly. Inclusion of trailers in Phase 2 was a crucial step forward, because known, affordable trailer aerodynamic and tire technologies can deliver over 10% fuel savings for tractor-trailers. Tractor truck engine efficiency will improve 5% by 2027. Combining improvements from engines, transmissions, aerodynamics, tires, and trailers, average tractor-trailer fuel efficiency will almost double from 2010 to 2027.
The better: Forward-looking program design
The vehicle certification protocols in Phase 2 will promote integration of engine, transmission, and vehicle components. The modeling tool for calculating vehicles’ fuel efficiency and GHG emissions (GEM) has become more sophisticated, which will allow many more technologies to contribute to vehicles’ certified fuel efficiency. Improved categorization of vehicles, inclusion of road grade, and re-weighting of certification cycles will help certification values closely mimic real-world fuel efficiency.  
The best: Cost-effective program and big oil savings
The Phase 2 standards are highly cost-effective. A typical buyer of a new long-haul truck in 2027 will recoup the cost of the added technologies in under two years through fuel savings. The program will provide continuity and certainty to manufacturers, deliver savings at the pump to truck owners and operators, and reduce freight costs. The 37% overall reduction in heavy-duty vehicle fuel consumption from Phases 1 and 2 together will yield savings of about 1.5 million barrels of oil per day (MBD) in 2040.
The Phase 2 standards are a win-win-win for the transportation industry, consumers, and the environment. The new program enjoys wide-ranging support from engine and truck manufacturers, suppliers, fleets, and the environmental community. Cummins, Daimler, Con-way, FedEx, UPS, Waste Management, and PepsiCo, among others, have endorsed the new standards.

Will New England electricity consumption continue to stay flat?;"In the US, electricity consumption has been essentially flat in recent years. Increased energy efficiency efforts have contributed to this lack of consumption growth, even as the US economy has grown. Looking forward, we believe that energy efficiency measures will likely drive consumption further down. However, there will be a variety of other trends affecting future electricity consumption and peak demand including:
Accelerating use of distributed power generation on the customer side of the meter, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, which decrease the power that must be supplied by the grid
Growing use of electric vehicles (EVs)
Possibly expanding use of electric heat pumps (HPs) to replace space and water heating equipment that burn fossil fuels
The pace of these different trends is hard to predict. As Niels Bohr has noted, “prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.” This said, it is useful to get a sense of how these trends might affect electricity consumption and peak demand in the future so that we can begin to plan ahead. Today, ACEEE released a paper that provides three scenarios on how these trends could affect one region in particular—New England. We chose New England because all of these trends are active in New England, based in part on regional efforts to address climate change.
Our analysis includes a reference scenario as well as two alternative scenarios with progressively more aggressive assumptions about the use of energy efficiency, PV, EVs, and heat pumps. In the reference scenario (which comes from the Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook), electricity sales decline until 2018 and then gradually rise. In our two alternative scenarios, sales decline more through about 2030 (due primarily to the greater energy efficiency included), but then increase over the 2030–2040 period as the electric vehicle and heat pump market shares increase significantly. Our three scenarios are presented in the figure below, which also shows the Independent System Operator—New England (ISO-NE) forecast that extends to 2025. The impacts of energy efficiency on sales are greater than the impacts of PV. Heat pumps and EVs both increase sales, with heat pumps having the larger effect relative to the reference case.
We also examined trends for summer and winter peak demand. In the reference case, both summer and winter peak demand modestly increase. ISO-NE also predicts gradually rising peak demand. In our more accelerated scenarios, summer peak demand declines and winter peak demand modestly grows. In our middle scenario, summer peak declines until about 2030 and then levels off before starting modest growth, reflecting the impact of EVs and heat pumps. (We assume that a significant share of heat pump growth occurs in homes lacking central air conditioning because adding air conditioning to a home can be a significant consumer motivator.) The increase in winter peak demand is driven by growth in EVs and heat pumps. In the most aggressive scenario, by 2040 summer peak demand is only a little higher than winter peak demand. And the trends are such that the winter peak could surpass the summer peak in the 2040s.
Of course, other scenarios are also possible, such as combining our more aggressive EV and heat pump scenarios with lower levels of efficiency and PV. Such scenarios would result in higher sales and higher summer peaks. The annual rate of efficiency savings shown in the accelerated and aggressive scenarios have been achieved in several of the New England states, although there is uncertainty about how many years these increased savings rates can be maintained. The levels of PV, EV, and heat pumps are more speculative and are subject to large uncertainty.
Both the ISO-NE forecast and our scenarios illustrate the importance of incorporating energy efficiency, as well as PV, into load forecasts. If energy efficiency and PV were not included, forecasts would be much higher, resulting in extra costs for ratepayers if the grid were designed to serve higher loads. Our scenarios also illustrate the importance of including EVs and heat pumps in long-term forecasts. While the impacts of these technologies are moderate over the next ten years (the period covered by the ISO-NE load forecast), for longer timeframes these technologies could become increasingly important.
At this point, it is probably premature for resource planning to put too much weight on these long-term scenarios. However, these scenarios do point out two possibilities that resource planners should keep in mind. First, it is possible that kWh sales and summer peak demand will no longer grow. Existing power plants will retire and may need to be replaced, and the grid will also need investment to replace aging equipment and address growth in some fast-growing regions, but significant growth in sales and resource needs above present levels are unlikely over the next 25 years. Second, over the longer term (post 2040), electricity sales could grow beyond current levels if EVs and heat pumps take off, and it is possible that the New England region will become winter peaking during this period.
We are entering a dynamic period with substantial uncertainty for long-term electricity sales and peaks. Trends in energy efficiency, PV, EV, and heat pump impacts need to be carefully observed and analyzed over the next few years. Resource planners should be sure to incorporate these emerging trends into their long-term forecasting and planning, giving them greater clarity and clearer direction. This observation and analysis may also keep energy consumption, energy costs, and energy sector emissions down while continuing to provide the electricity needed to grow the New England economy.

Our new analysis finds energy efficiency is the 3rd largest resource in the US electric power sector;"Have you ever described efficiency as an energy resource and gotten a quizzical look in return? We have, even though utility system planners have been using energy efficiency for decades to make sure that power for their customers is both reliable and affordable. For those of us who have been in the energy efficiency industry for years, or even decades, we sometimes take for granted that others will understand what we mean. But we must not. We must help educate a wider audience that energy savings from greater efficiency—whether we call them negawatts, an invisible energy source, virtual power plants, or something else—are a cornerstone of our nation’s energy system and critical to a clean and affordable energy future. In fact, energy efficiency is now the third largest resource in the US electric power sector, as shown in a new report we released today.
How we crunched the numbers
Last year we set out to quantify the size of the energy efficiency resource that currently exists in the electric power sector using a bottom-up approach to estimate energy savings achieved through specific policies and programs. We looked at three areas. First, through our State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, we had 10 years of state-level data on evaluated energy savings from utility-sector energy efficiency programs. Second, we used state-level energy savings estimates of appliance efficiency standards from the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP). And third, we used state-level energy savings estimates of building energy codes from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).
Energy savings produce huge benefits
The combined impacts of these three major energy efficiency efforts since 1990 amount to a remarkable accomplishment in the US electric power sector. We estimate that not only is efficiency our third largest resource, but, more importantly, it has averted the need to build the equivalent of 313 power plants since 1990. We also estimate that efficiency reduced annual carbon dioxide emissions, a major contributor to climate change, by 490 million tons in 2015. We can see further evidence of efficiency’s impact in the fact that electricity consumption has flattened in recent years even as the economy has grown. What’s more, energy efficiency has saved consumers $90 billion annually on electric bills. For American households, this translates to average savings of $460 per year.
Many more benefits come from investing in energy efficiency. For example, efficiency is especially important for low-income, African-American, Latino, and renting households because it lowers their energy bills over the long term and helps alleviate their disproportionate energy burden (the percentage of household income spent on utilities). Our new report also details other benefits of efficiency such as economic development, job creation, community resilience, and improved health, safety, and comfort.
Energy efficiency could become our number one resource by 2030
We can do much more through energy efficiency in the electric power sector, as ACEEE and others have recently documented. If we increase our application of the three major policies examined in this report (appliance and equipment efficiency standards, utility energy efficiency targets of 1.5% per year, and building energy codes), efficiency could become our nation’s largest electricity resource by 2030, providing one-third of total expected electricity generation needs. These additional energy savings would avoid the need for electrical capacity equivalent to 487 power plants. Combined with the gains since 1990, savings from energy efficiency could amount to the output of 800 power plants by 2030.
State-level policy action is critical to this level of achievement. ACEEE has found that energy efficiency policies can play a major role in each state’s compliance plan for the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Power Plan, which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the electricity sector to limit climate change. Most states could meet at least 25% of their emissions reduction requirement through efficiency policies and the resulting investments, and many could achieve 100%.
Other sectors have huge energy efficiency potential
While this paper tells the story of the efficiency resource in the electricity sector and its emission reduction benefits, there is much more to the story of energy efficiency and climate change mitigation. According to the EPA, the transportation sector accounts for 26.5% of GHG emissions in the United States, followed by industrial (21.4%), buildings (12.4%), and agricultural (9.2%), Efficiency has an important role to play in all of these areas. For example, the transportation sector could potentially reach zero emissions by 2050, with more than half the reductions coming from energy efficiency, including both vehicle and transportation efficiency. The International Energy Agency estimates that energy efficiency will need to account for nearly half of all GHG emission reductions through 2040 to reach a scenario in which the global increase in temperature is limited to 2 degrees Celsius.
We will need major investments and critical support from government, industry, and the nonprofit community to reach these relative levels of energy savings in the US and realize all the benefits they can bring. Just as major policies and commitments in recent decades have helped energy efficiency become our third largest electricity resource today, now we need a new era of visionary policy to create opportunity for future generations.

New resource details past and future of ACEEE’s work on the water-energy nexus;"ACEEE’s interest in the energy–water nexus comes from the fact that a large amount of energy is consumed in the water and wastewater industries, as well as in water end-uses, primarily water heating. Addressing water and energy efficiency together can lead to substantial cost-effective energy and water savings. Other benefits include mitigating and adapting to climate change, and increasing community resilience.
Increased coordination between the water and energy sectors breaks down traditional silos and paves the way for an integrative approach to saving energy and water. ACEEE has been at the forefront of these efforts along with several partners, including the Alliance for Water Efficiency (AWE), the Water Environment Federation, the National Association of Water Companies (NAWC), and a number of national laboratories.
Today we’re releasing a new resource, The Energy–Water Nexus: Exploring the Stream of Opportunities, summarizing our efforts over the past decade and describing opportunities for future ACEEE work.
Looking at past work on the nexus
ACEEE first forayed into the energy–water field in 2005 by convening thought leaders to chart a path forward for research. In 2011, ACEEE and AWE held a workshop with 41 organizations from the water and energy sectors. We released the workshop’s takeaways in Addressing the Energy–Water Nexus: A Blueprint for Action. The blueprint outlined eight ways to advance our understanding of the energy–water nexus and, consequently, change the way energy and water are managed.
Since then, we have pursued research on various aspects of the blueprint. To address its second element—to better understand how energy is embedded in water and water is embedded in energy—ACEEE began conducting research and collecting data to inform program design. Our first effort was the 2014 report, Watts in a Drop of Water: Savings at the Water–Energy Nexus. This study included energy-intensity ranges for water conveyance, distribution, and treatment, and for wastewater treatment and discharge. Our 2015 follow-up report, A Survey of Energy Use in Water Companies, analyzed surveys of NAWC member companies concerning energy use in water processing.
Another element of the blueprint we focused on is the increased collaboration between the energy and water communities. ACEEE’s 2013 report, Saving Water and Energy Together: Helping Utilities Build Better Programs, identified the opportunities and benefits of creating joint programs to save water and energy in the residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and municipal sectors.
What does the future hold?
We’ve kept busy, but there’s more to do. In addition to disseminating our research to new audiences, we'll consider updating past research, like our work on joint energy and water utility collaboration. We'll also consider new topics, including the connection between climate change and the energy–water nexus, and how efforts to increase efficiency in water end-uses and the water system can increase community resilience. Future research could document how these efforts can reduce community exposure to acute and chronic stressors, including high utility bills for low-income households.
Check out the resource for more details, and stay tuned for our future work. ACEEE will continue to collaborate with our partners to prioritize research areas and deliver insightful, high-quality analysis on ways to efficiently save both energy and water.

ACEEE Applauds Phase 2 Heavy-Duty Fuel Efficiency and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards;"by ACEEE Senior Researcher Siddiq Khan
ACEEE applauds the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation for finalizing the second phase of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles, model years 2021 through 2027. The Phase 2 standards will deliver major reductions in the fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of heavy-duty trucks and buses, which currently account for 23 percent of US transportation energy use. Capturing full-vehicle efficiency and regulating trailers for the first time, the Phase 2 standards would further reduce new heavy-duty vehicles’ fuel consumption by 25 percent, on average, by model year 2027. The final standards include a slight improvement over the proposed rule in the stringency of engine standards.
The Phase 2 standards will deliver major savings at the pump to truck owners and operators, which will in turn reduce the cost of freight movement nationwide. With these fuel savings, most truckers will recover the incremental cost of the more efficient trucks in less than two years. The standards also provide long-term certainty for manufacturers investing in clean engine and vehicle technologies. The Phase 2 program will strengthen the market for truck efficiency technologies, helping to ensure that the United States remains a world leader in this area.
While the standards set a course for fuel efficiency gains over the next decade, even further technological improvements are already well within view. The SuperTruck Program, a collaboration between the Department of Energy and truck manufacturers and suppliers, has brought to light engine technologies, aerodynamic improvements, and other fuel efficiency strategies that could take tractor trucks well beyond Phase 2 levels. Hybridization has substantial potential for other classes of vehicles covered by the standards. These and other measures to accelerate the development of advanced technologies for heavy-duty vehicles warrant further attention in the years to come.

Energy-water nexus issues heighten in the face of climate change;"ACEEE and many others have noted the importance of the nexus between energy and water issues. Energy is used to move, treat, and heat water. Water is vital for producing energy, such as for cooling electric generating plants. Insufficient water availability can increase energy use for pumping and decrease energy production. Flooding can damage both energy and water systems. And there are many opportunities to promote both energy and water efficiency at the same time. Next month we will release a fact sheet on our work on the energy-water nexus and how both energy and water efficiency play critical roles. But first, I want to explore how the relationship between energy and water may evolve in future years, particularly in response to climate change.
Impacts on water supply and demand from Climate change
Parts of the US—primarily in the triangle from Montana to southern California to western Texas—are already experiencing water stress, meaning that water is being withdrawn from water sources at a rate that might not be sustainable (see map on page 272 here).
According to the US Global Change Research Program, as the climate changes, some regions, such as south of the Great Lakes, will get more precipitation and other regions, like the southwest, will get less. A stylized map of expected precipitation changes from their 2008 report is below.
Water flow change in 2040-2060 relative to 1901-1970. Source: US Climate Change Science Program, p. 138. (following this report the program was renamed the US Global Change Research Program).
But precipitation is only part of the picture. Population and other trends will also affect water withdrawals. In the 2014 National Climate Assessment report, the US Global Change Research Program compared expected withdrawals with and without climate change. As shown below, they found that without climate change, withdrawals would increase in roughly half of the US, with particularly large increases in Arizona, Florida, Maine, and east of the Cascade Mountains. With climate change, they estimate substantial increases in withdrawals in most regions except for around the Great Lakes.
Projected changes in water withdrawals from 2005 to 2060 assuming (a) change in population and socioeconomic conditions based on preferred emissions scenario, but with no change in climate, and (b) combined changes in population, socioeconomic conditions, and climate according to the same emissions scenario (gradual reductions from current emission trends beginning around mid-century). Source: US Global Change Research Program, Water Resources chapter, p. 85.
Four potential impacts on the energy-water nexus
What does all this mean for the energy-water nexus? This question can be divided into several issues, largely drawing from the US Global Change Research Program 2014 report referenced above.
First, energy use for water extraction and treatment is likely to increase. For example, with water scarcer in some regions, energy use for water pumping is likely to increase, particularly for groundwater in areas with declining water tables such as California’s Central Valley and the Ogallala Aquifer in the Great Plains. Additional energy will also likely be needed to improve drinking water quality in areas like Florida where water supplies could become saltier. And in areas with large water deficits, there may be a need for energy-intensive water reuse and even desalinization plants. We have not seen any good estimates of how much energy use may increase as a result of these multiple factors.
Second, demand for water might increase for some end-uses such as irrigation and water-cooled air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Warmer and dryer weather would increase use of irrigation and cooling, but how much of this increased need is served with more water, versus avoided with improved water management practices is an open question. For example, a 2015 review by USDA of multiple studies found a median estimate of modest increases in irrigated acreage through 2060 (increasing water use in the medium-term), but then significant declines in the 2060-2080 period (decreasing water use in the long-term due to shifts in cropping patterns). In addition, water demand for energy production (power plant cooling and fracking) could increase, but in regions with tight water supplies this increased demand could perhaps be offset by major efforts to improve the efficiency of water use, or to avoid power production or fracking entirely.
Third, changes in water availability in some regions could affect energy production. For example, an assessment by DOE of the effect of climate change on power produced by federal hydro facilities found increases in some regions, decreases in other regions, and often a shift towards more production in winter and less in summer, requiring changes in seasonal power management practices.
For fossil fuel and nuclear power plants, lack of cooling water or cooling water that is too warm could prevent operation of a few power plants during dry and hot periods, problems that have at times already affected power production in the southeast and other regions (see here and here). A study by European and American researchers estimated that thermoelectric power generating capacity in the US will decrease by between 4–16% between 2031 to 2060, and 6–19% in Europe due to lack of cooling water. Limited water availability could also affect oil and gas production in some regions.
Fourth, excessive water, due to floods and/or higher tides, will affect some coastal energy and water facilities. The problem may affect many wastewater treatment facilities located on flood plains that serve areas like Seattle, New York City, and parts of Massachusetts. Flooding could also affect the electric distribution system, as happened in New York State and New Jersey during Superstorm Sandy, causing power outages and expensive system repairs.  Similar problems could happen elsewhere.
In summary, major changes are likely for many of the issues involved in the energy-water nexus. In future blog posts we will explore these issues further to address:

How increasing efficiency can stem climate change impacts on the energy-water nexus;"ACEEE’s first entry in our energy-water blog series outlined the ways climate change could fundamentally affect the energy-water nexus. In this post, we explore the roles of energy efficiency and water efficiency in moderating some of the adverse impacts of climate change that we covered in the prior post.
Several of ACEEE’s past reports document the inherent linkages between energy and water, and their implications for reducing waste (see here, here, and here). You’ve heard it before, but it’s important to restate: efforts to save water save energy, and efforts to save energy save water. Recognizing this linkage is especially important as climate change begins to alter the dynamics of the energy-water relationship. 
Ways to waste less energy in water services and in homes
Before addressing the climate change connection, we’ll touch on what increased efficiency looks like in the water and wastewater sectors, as well as in homes and businesses. There are lots of opportunities to reduce the amount of wasted energy that is related to water. Take drinking water plants for example. Generally speaking, 80% of energy use at drinking water plants is for running motors that pump water. Capital upgrades at water treatment plans, such as installing more energy-efficient pumps or those with variable speed drives, can be part of the solution to increase energy efficiency at these energy-intensive public facilities.
At wastewater treatment plants, even more energy savings are possible by using byproducts of the treatment process to efficiently generate energy for use onsite. Rather than flaring biogas from sludge digesters, some facilities use the gas to operate combined heat and power units to generate heat and electricity.
At the water customer site, energy can be saved through greater use of “greywater” in appropriate applications—we need full water treatment for drinking water, but less pure water can often be used for non-drinking applications (see case studies here). 
In addition, there are myriad opportunities for increasing efficiency when heating water for our homes and buildings. Check out presentations from our 2016 Hot Water Forum for examples. 
Climate change creates stress on water systems, but energy efficiency can help
As we discussed in our previous blog post, energy use for extraction and treatment of drinking water is expected to increase. For example, saltwater intrusion into some water supplies may mean turning to more energy-intensive water treatment processes. The opportunities to reduce energy in water processes should be seen as part of the solution. Improving energy efficiency can not only soften the blow of increasing energy requirements, but it can also soften the blow on municipal budgets (electricity use for water and wastewater utilities is already a significant operating expense for municipalities). Those treatment plants in flood plains will need significant capital investments to protect them from sea level rise and flooding, so it is a good time to incorporate efficiency as part of these capital investments.
On the electric power generation side of the equation, as cooling water becomes warmer during hot spells or becomes more scarce, the capacity of thermoelectric power generating plants may also decrease. While there are steps that can be taken, such as dry cooling, these come at a significant cost and efficiency penalty. Energy efficiency is not a silver bullet for the changing availability of cooling water; however, increased efficiency can offset some of the decreased capacity and make the energy supply go further, easing resource constraints when it is important to do so.
Using water efficiency to reduce climate stresses
There are many tools in the water conservation toolbox that can alleviate climate stresses, too. Reducing water lost in the distribution system through leak detection programs (see examples here and here) and using water-saving products—like WaterSense-labeled appliances—are two examples. (Both leak detection and water efficiency retrofits are part of the reason water demand from communities served by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority has fallen by nearly a third since 1980.) These technologies and practices will be important for moderating water demand, when climate change may push demand upwards or alter supply. Tamping down on water waste throughout the system will cushion the impact of likely increased demand for water end-uses like agricultural irrigation and refrigeration equipment. Attention should also be paid to considering water availability when making crop choices—it makes little sense to grow water-intensive crops in the desert.
Green infrastructure (like rain gardens and bioswales) also share some of the climate change benefits discussed above. When a storm hits a community with a combined sewer system, green infrastructure reduces the flow of wastewater into treatment plants, potentially lessening energy demand. Some green infrastructure (like green roofs) can also reduce the urban heat island effect, lessening cooling loads. Green infrastructure’s benefits also are important to keep in mind as climate change necessitates new infrastructure investments.  
Accelerating efficiency efforts
The topics discussed here only scratch the surface of efficiency’s adaptation properties, while not touching on its mitigation properties (as others have here, here, and here). Accelerating efforts to save both water and energy will be key in making communities more resilient as the impacts of climate change continue to manifest themselves. We will write about more ways to specifically accelerate efforts, like increasing efficiency programs administered by water and energy utilities, in future posts.
What is the current state of efficiency at the water-energy nexus? The 2015 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard gives us a snapshot for the water utilities and wastewater utilities serving 51 large US cities through its metrics on water efficiency, energy efficiency in water and wastewater facilities, and energy-efficient stormwater management policies. What does it tell us? With only 9 cities receiving perfect scores, there’s room for improvement, and lots of untapped potential.

ASAP/ACEEE Report on Energy-Saving Standards: Next President Could Set In Motion “Enormous” Energy and Carbon Pollution Cuts Benefitting Consumers $65 Billion a Year;"Obama Legacy on Appliance Standards Exceeds All Previous Presidents; What Will Next Administration Do?  Potential Carbon Pollution Cuts Equal by 2050 to Closing 60 Coal-Fired Power Plants.
Washington, DC—In the wake of a historic number of energy-efficiency standards completed during the Obama Administration, the next occupant of the White House could preside over updates to existing US appliance, equipment, and lighting efficiency standards that by 2050 would cut climate emissions by the annual equivalent of 60 coal-fired power plants and lower consumer utility bills by $65 billion a year, according to a new study released today by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
Entitled “Next Generation Standards: How the National Energy Efficiency Standards Program Can Continue to Drive Energy, Economic, and Environmental Benefits,” the new ASAP and ACEEE study is available online at http://aceee.org/research-report/a1604.
To date, the Obama Administration has completed a total of 45 appliance, equipment, and lighting efficiency standards, more than all other US presidents combined since the bipartisan enactment of the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987. That national appliance standards law requires the US Department of Energy to review each standard at least once every six years to determine if an update is warranted and, if so, to complete that update within the ensuing two years.
Based on estimates for 45 of the roughly 55 products currently included in the national standards program, the ASAP and ACEEE analysis looks at what could happen in the next eight years, assuming future standard updates will be based on currently existing technology and completed and take effect on the latest date allowable under the law.  Appliance standards fell behind schedule for a time in the 1990s and 2000s, which is one reason why the focus and resolve of the next Administration is so important.
The study concludes that “efficiency standards updated within the next eight years have the potential to reap very large energy and consumer bill savings. The next administration could achieve cumulative nationwide savings of 70 quadrillion Btus (quads) of energy and 3.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 2050 while cutting consumer and business utility bills by $1.1 trillion. Even greater savings may be achieved by investing in improved test procedures, systematically assessing opportunities for expanding the scope of national standards, improving analysis techniques and data sources, assessing opportunities for standards to contribute to systems-level savings, and taking connectedness into account.”
On an annual basis, that works out to 335 billion kilowatt hours in electricity savings, 200 million metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution cuts, and $65 billion in lower utility bills in 2050.  Additionally, 850 billion gallons of water—roughly equal to what Texas households use in a year— would be saved.
Andrew deLaski, executive director, ASAP, said: “These truly enormous savings, which are even larger than we expected to find, show that the next President of the United States can draw on a well of efficiency savings that is much deeper than once thought.  And there is more good news here: A continuation of the Obama administration focus on appliance standards combined with further technological advances could reap even bigger benefits for both consumers and the environment.”
Lowell Ungar, senior policy advisor, ACEEE, said: “Appliance standards are the Olympics of energy efficiency policy. This report shows that, thanks to continued innovation in appliances and equipment, we can still raise the bar for higher consumer bill savings and run faster toward clean air.”
Mel Hall-Crawford, energy projects director, Consumer Federation of America, said: “Given the tremendous success of energy efficiency standards, which already are saving consumers approximately $63 billion per year, this forward-looking report is a timely and well-thought-out roadmap for the next administration to continue on the path to providing even greater energy savings for the country.”
Joanna Mauer, technical advocacy manager, ASAP, said: “Our report shows that continued technology advancements are unlocking large savings opportunities, including for products that have already seen significant efficiency gains. The potential for new standards to keep on delivering big energy, water, and bill savings benefits is as great as ever. Our analysis shows that the next president could match or even top the impressive savings achieved during the Obama Administration.”
Other key report findings include the following:
Potential annual energy savings in 2035 equal the current annual energy consumption of all the homes in Texas and Ohio combined. Potential savings in 2050 grow to cover current consumption of homes in those states plus New York and South Carolina.
Just 10 products account for more than 70 percent of cumulative energy and utility bill savings potential. The most impactful potential standards are for: water heaters; central air conditioners/heat pumps; showerheads; clothes dryers; fans; electric motors; refrigerators/freezers; faucets; distribution transformers; and compressors.
Taking into account standards enacted by law and those set by DOE, the Obama administration has completed 18 more standards than any prior administration. Accounting only for standards set by DOE rulemaking, the Obama administration has completed seven times more standards than any previous administration.  Standards already completed during the Obama administration will cumulatively save 44 quads of energy and save consumers and businesses $540 billion on their utility bills through 2030. These savings far exceed the savings from standards adopted administratively under any prior president. Standards expected to be completed between June 2016 and January 2017 will add to these totals.
The updates to existing standards over the next eight years would come on top of the long-term benefits from the underlying standards themselves. According to DOE, existing efficiency standards completed through February 2016 will, on a cumulative basis from 1987 to 2030, reduce the need for 132 quads of energy, save consumers nearly $2 trillion on their utility bills, and reduce CO2 emissions by more than 7 billion metric tons. For comparison, the entire US economy uses about 100 quads of energy per year.
ABOUT THE GROUPS
ASAP (http://www.appliance-standards.org) organizes and leads a broad-based coalition effort that works to advance, win, and defend new appliance, equipment, and lighting standards which deliver large energy and water savings, monetary savings, and environmental benefits. Working together, the ASAP coalition supports new and updated standards at the national and state levels through technical and policy advocacy and through outreach and education. ASAP was founded in 1999 by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the Alliance to Save Energy, the Energy Foundation, and Natural Resources Defense Council.

Mobile homes move toward efficiency;"Do you know which government in the United States is the biggest laggard on energy codes for homes? The federal government. But that’s about to change.
Manufactured homes and the “HUD Code”
Although building codes are mostly set by states, the federal government sets codes for manufactured homes (sometimes called mobile homes) because the factory does not always know where a home will end up. Manufacturers shipped 70,519 homes in 2015, more than the number of single-family homes built in any state except Texas.
Texas and the other states that built the most houses (Florida, California, North Carolina, Georgia, and South Carolina) all have energy codes as good as or better than the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), the model code for “stick-built” homes. Unfortunately, the energy provisions of the “HUD Code” (set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development) that governs manufactured housing have not been changed significantly since 1994. Since then the IECC was created and has been updated five times.
So even though manufactured homes are relatively small, the owners pay a lot in energy bills, a national average of $1,800 per year in 2009. Although this is a little less than the average bill for single-family homes, the average energy cost per square foot is more than twice as high. And most of the people who pay the bills are low-income residents. The median income of families in manufactured homes is about $30,000. Many of them spend more on their energy bills than on home loans.
The new standard is a big saver
In 2007, Congress got fed up and directed the Department of Energy to set energy standards for manufactured homes based on the most recent IECC. The 2011 deadline came and went without even a draft. In 2014 DOE convened stakeholders for a negotiated rulemaking, and in October 2014 we (I was on the committee) successfully came to agreement on the key terms. A year later DOE submitted the proposed standard for Office of Management and Budget Review, and in June, after more than eight years, DOE finally issued the draft. The draft is open for comment through August 16.
The standard will make a real difference for homeowners and rural electric grids. DOE estimates the typical manufactured home will save 27% of energy use compared to a home that meets the current HUD Code. Average lifetime savings for homeowners are estimated at almost $4,000 net present value. Cumulative national savings include 2.3 quadrillion Btu of energy (equivalent to the energy use in one year of all homes in New York and Florida), $3-11 billion customer benefits (depending on discount rate), and 160 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.
In developing the draft, we started from the 2015 IECC but made many changes. Here are a few. We reduced the number of climate regions from eight to four, divided mostly along state lines, to make implementation easier. We replaced the performance path with an overall building shell heat transfer (U-factor) requirement, the metric currently used in the HUD Code (and we left out the new Energy Rating Index, which the manufacturers did not plan to use). We replaced the air leakage standard with construction quality requirements because it is hard to test a two-section home until it is assembled in the field. We adjusted for the lack of room to add roof insulation and still be able to truck the homes. And we eased up on required efficiency levels in the Southeast because manufacturers were especially concerned about the impact of the first cost on their low-income buyers there. But the standard would still save 28% compared to the HUD Code in that region.
Moving forward
Perhaps most importantly, the committee’s scope did not include implementation or enforcement, and DOE still needs to work out how to ensure manufacturers meet the new code without undue burden or conflicts with HUD’s enforcement of health and safety requirements. There also are more energy savings we should achieve in manufactured homes through voluntary programs or future measures, in part because we did not touch on appliances or heating or cooling equipment.
But the proposed standard would greatly benefit homeowners who need the help. We hope DOE will complete the standard and set a better example for states adopting codes without further delay.

America’s Transportation Energy Burden for Low-Income Families;"ACEEE recently released Lifting the High Energy Burden in America’s Largest Cities, a report highlighting the financial burden energy costs can place on households in cities across the United States. The analysis found that the overwhelming majority of low-income households and households of color experience higher-than-average energy burdens. On average, the percentage of household income that low-income households pay on their home energy bills is more than three times what their higher-income counterparts pay. Energy efficiency can help reduce this burden and improve energy affordability for households.
Transportation costs are higher for low-income households
The elevated burden on low-income households is compounded by transportation costs which are the second largest expense for households in the United States after housing-related expenditures. The average household in the US spends almost 20% of its total income on transportation expenses. For low-income households, this average burden can be as high as 30%, according to a survey conducted by the Center of Neighborhood Technology (CNT) of 28 metropolitan areas across the country. As cities have grown outwards and jobs have moved away from urban cores, many low-income and minority communities are inadequately served by affordable and efficient transportation options. With personal vehicles serving as the primary mode of transport, expenditures for vehicle, fuel, insurance, and maintenance for these households can be very large and very unpredictable.
CNT’s Housing +Transportation Affordability Index emphasizes the importance of incorporating transportation costs into cost burden analyses by providing an overview of affordability at the neighborhood level that packages housing and transportation costs together. Their research has found that, among the 337 metropolitan areas included in the H&T index (which captures 80% of the US population and 90% of US GDP), the number of communities considered affordable drops dramatically when the definition of affordability includes not just housing costs but transportation costs as well.
Likewise, when it comes to discussing household energy burden, heating and electric bills don’t tell the whole story. Transportation energy costs must be part of a discussion about the energy burden for low-income and minority households in the United States, especially since the amount a household spends on fuel is determined by factors such as location, access to public transit, and global oil prices—a factor that is out of household control.
Targeted policies and programs can help, but more research is needed
Protecting these households against an overwhelming transportation energy burden requires a targeted set of policies and programs to achieve a balance of housing and jobs, provide communities with transportation alternatives, and reduce commute distances. Encouraging the development of compact, transit-oriented home construction increases the likelihood that residents will have the option to use public transit and non-motorized modes of transport as their primary means of travel in order to save on car-related expenditures. Ensuring that home construction is mixed-income goes one step further in ensuring that the housing stock around transit hubs is financially accessible to low-income households, eventually removing occupants’ need to move farther from mass transit in order to find affordable living spaces, thus minimizing the expensive commute to job centers.
Additionally, implementing codes and laws to ensure that streets are connected and accessible to pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transit gives residents more travel options and more control over their transport expenses. Portland’s Pearl District is an example of these policies in practice. All homes within the district are within 500 meters of a transit stop and affordable housing is available for families and individuals earning less than 80% of the median income of the region.
When communities have convenient, affordable, and reliable alternatives to driving, household transportation expenditures can be controlled more effectively and protected against fluctuations in fuel prices. Additional research is needed to characterize the transportation energy burden for a variety of metropolitan areas, income groups, and household types to develop a coherent approach to addressing the total energy burden for communities in the United States.

Bank of America’s Energy Efficiency Financing Program shows path to combining energy savings and community development;"If you spend any time with the energy efficiency crowd, you will often hear us call it the lowest cost energy resource out there. What you will never hear us say is that energy efficiency is free. Efficiency can do many great things: It saves money, cuts pollution, increases productivity, and creates jobs. What it can’t do is defy one of the fundamental laws that governs all investments—it takes money to make money.
We want to get money flowing into well-designed energy efficiency projects, especially those that can do the most good where it is the most needed, but that’s not as easy as it sounds. It can be particularly challenging to attract investment in low- and moderate-income communities. Buildings in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities are often older and have outdated and aging materials and equipment that leave lots of room for efficiency improvement. So we look at these buildings, we see a lot of low-hanging fruit, and we think that there should be a way to invest in them. But we’re not sure if we can.
A few years ago, Bank of America decided to test the proposition. Bank of America works with Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), nonprofit loan centers that focus on LMI neighborhoods, to help invest in the communities they serve. In 2011, they launched their Energy Efficiency Financing Program to provide up to $55 million of low-cost capital to CDFIs for energy efficiency and other clean energy loans. The Bank of America Charitable Foundation also provided $5 million in grants to help CDFIs offset the administrative costs of running their programs. Bank of America teamed up with Bright Power to track pre-retrofit and post-retrofit data so that the results of the program could be analyzed, and they asked us to take a look at the results of the program. Today, we’re releasing a report on our findings, that gives a detailed analysis of the results of their efforts.
The aim was to help CDFIs scale up successful existing programs and support promising new pilots, as well as to create jobs in the post-recession economy. Bank of America also sought to find out if the savings from energy efficiency investments were sufficient and stable enough for this to be a viable financial market.
In total, the CDFIs loaned out more than $70 million, which included additional funds from other sources. The loans were used for efficiency upgrades, solar panel installations, and conversions from heating oil to natural gas. In many cases these were done in conjunction with other repair or upgrade projects. The table below gives a summary of the loans that were made.
Looking at the data both on the loans and the buildings themselves, we found the results to be fairly strong. For individual buildings, we calculated a projected Savings to Investment Ratio (SIR) for the subset of buildings for which we got energy data. The SIR compares the present value of the lifetime savings that the energy measures should provide to their upfront costs (excluding the costs of any non-energy measures). The figure below ranks the buildings in terms of SIR from lowest to highest. Buildings with SIRs of over one have measures that will more than pay for themselves over their useful life. We also looked at a threshold of 0.33. Because high-efficiency equipment typically costs no more than 50% more than similar equipment of average efficiency, a project that generates enough savings to cover 33% of the its total cost is probably saving enough to cover the extra expense of the high-efficiency equipment. This means that for projects that involve replacing old equipment, a SIR of .33 should be enough to justify the extra expense of more efficient equipment.
As you can see, the buildings fared pretty well. Some did extraordinarily well, returning over 10 times the cost of the upgrades. Others did just OK, and a couple actually had negative SIRs, which means they consumed more energy after the upgrade than before. This is probably due to entirely unrelated reasons, like the addition of a family member to a household or a change of operating hours for a business.
The loans that financed the upgrades did well, too. At the time of reporting, 1.2% of the loans by original volume were 30 days past due and 0.7% were in default. These numbers likely understate the success of the program because even if a loan goes into default, some of it has already been paid back. In speaking with the CDFIs, they felt confident that most of these loans would eventually be brought back into good standing.
The program was successful on two levels. First, as the chart shows, the upgrades performed on the buildings in our sample saved quite a bit of energy, and in most cases, it was more than enough to cover their costs. In our discussions with the CDFI lenders, it was clear that relying on existing or new partnerships with experienced efficiency implementers was key. Energy is not usually at the top of people’s minds, whether they own an apartment building, a business, or their own home. The programs were most effective when CDFIs, who know the owners and often already have them as customers, partnered with energy experts who could design and implement effective upgrade projects.
Second, the loans have also been successful, and the portfolio is performing well. This is due in part to strong partnerships between CDFIs and Bank of America. Bank of America created a flexible loan program CDFIs could shape to the needs of their customers. With that capital and flexibility, CDFIs, in turn, leveraged their knowledge of the local community to invest in energy efficiency projects that will have long lasting impacts. 
Of course, our data is not exhaustive, and these results don’t guarantee that projects like these will always perform well. At the same time, for building owners, CDFIs, and large investors, we see good news here. Homeowners and building owners can clearly save money investing in efficiency, and CDFIs can include energy efficiency in their mission to serve economically challenged communities. For large banks, this is clear evidence that it is possible to design financially viable efficiency-lending programs that could help solve the problem of how to attract investment dollars to help generate energy savings. Finally, this is good news for energy consumers everywhere. As the efficiency market continues to mature and key financial institutions learn how to make it part of their business model, we will see more and more investment in efficiency for homes and businesses, bringing the savings, job creation, pollution reduction, and other benefits of energy efficiency to a steadily broadening audience.

Is PACE moving to prime time?;"One of the distinctions we often make between energy and energy efficiency is that energy acts more like a cost, and energy efficiency acts more like an investment. Like most investments, energy efficiency works by using an up front expense to generate a stream of economic benefits. Every year, our Energy Efficiency Finance Forum conference looks at ways to manage these up-front costs and how to use that stream of benefits to turn energy efficiency into a viable investment market.
This upfront expense can often act as a significant barrier to energy efficiency. Buying a house used to have the same problem, but a long time ago, some smart people came up with the idea of a mortgage to help work around it.
How to finance energy efficiency improvements
More recently, some other smart people came up with a similar idea for energy efficiency. Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing is a relatively new strategy for funding efficiency and renewable investments that is really starting to take off. It works like this: let’s say you’ve identified a number of efficiency upgrades for your house, but you don’t have the cash on hand to pay for it. PACE financing will cover those upfront costs, but unlike a mortgage where a bank lends you the money that you use to buy the house and eventually pay back to the bank, a PACE financing company will pay for the upgrades directly and they tack the monthly payment onto your property tax bill by using something called a voluntary assessment.
The difference between PACE and a mortgage loan may not sound like a big deal, but it is. Mortgages work because in exchange for the loan, the bank puts a lien on your house. If you don’t pay, they can foreclose and sell the house to get their money back. Efficiency upgrades would be hard to foreclose on: Banks don’t want to rip out your insulation, and if they did, how much could they sell it for? Instead, PACE companies get their security from the assessment. If a house goes into foreclosure, the assessment stays attached to the house, and whoever buys it picks up payment where the previous owner left off. The same thing happens when you sell the house, which means that you won’t be afraid to undertake larger projects that need longer terms. If you sell the house, the new owner gets the benefits of the efficiency upgrades and pays for them through the assessment. By linking to the property tax, risk to the financer goes down, allowing lower interest rates and sometimes allowing credit to be extended to moderate income homeowners who might not normally qualify for an unsecured loan.
As in past years, PACE was a hot topic of conversation at our Energy Efficiency Finance Forum. Part of the reason is its rapid growth. Even though the concept is relatively new, over $2 billion has been invested in about 97,000 homes through residential PACE financing. PACENation estimates that residential PACE projects have created over 17,000 jobs just in implementing the upgrades. Our research on efficiency projects indicates that the energy savings they generate create as many net new jobs as the implementation does, so the total is really about double the PACENation estimate. PACE is increasingly being used in the commercial sector with about $250 million of loans issued according to PACENation.
Providing clarity for repayment
Anytime people get creative with finance, some questions come up, and PACE is no exception. In its early days, many PACE assessments were what is called first-position, which means that if a home went into foreclosure, any past due PACE payments would get paid before the mortgage did. This is standard for property taxes, but bankers and regulators were concerned that it would increase the risk of mortgages not getting fully paid off. They were also worried that a foreclosure would mean that all of outstanding PACE payments would immediately come due, including future ones that weren’t due yet. Last year, the White House and the Federal Housing Authority announced forthcoming guidance for PACE financiers to follow. Among other things, this guidance will clarify that PACE financing should go in second position—after the mortgage. This is important because it gives PACE financiers clarity on how to structure the assessments to make sure that the homes are still eligible for FHA mortgage insurance, which is critical to many borrowers.
The PACE industry was already moving to make second-position liens the industry standard and to make sure the assessments could stay in place in the event of a foreclosure. They were pleased with the announcement about forthcoming guidelines because they will give them a formal set of rules they could follow and know that they weren’t running afoul of banks and mortgage regulators. With these guidelines, the PACE market appears to be ready for another huge leap forward, particularly if key secondary mortgage players such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac decide to adopt these same guidelines. PACE is a powerful tool for communities, helping homeowners save money and reduce energy-related pollution. It’s just one example of what can happen when people think creatively about how to shape the emerging energy landscape, which is the kind of thing that happens regularly at our Finance Forum conference. I hope to see you at next year’s Energy Efficiency Finance Forum in Chicago.

The 2016 International Scorecard is almost here. Tune in next week to see the Olympics of energy efficiency;"As world-class athletes descend on Rio for the 2016 Olympic Games, twenty-three countries are vying in a very different arena to become leaders in energy efficiency.
On July 20, ACEEE will release the 2016 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard, showcasing winning energy efficiency policies and programs from around the globe. This year’s report examines 23 of the world’s top energy-consuming countries’ efficiency policies and performance. Together these countries represent 75% of all the energy consumed on the planet and over 80% of the world’s gross domestic product in 2013.
Changes since the last edition
New countries: The 2016 report features eight new contestants: Indonesia, the Netherlands, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. They will join the 2014 competitors which include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
New metrics: We use 35 metrics, including 4 new ones to evaluate each country’s national commitment to energy efficiency as well as its efficiency policies and performance in the buildings, industry, and transportation sectors. New metrics include data availability, presence of energy management systems in industry, efficiency standards for motors, and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) policy.
Policy versus performance weighting: This year’s scorecard leans more heavily towards energy efficiency policy, allocating 60% of the points to policy metrics and 40% to performance metrics, as opposed to the 50/50 breakdown used in the previous scorecard. Our new weighting allows for a fairer comparison between the countries since performance metrics can be affected by factors other than energy efficiency that cannot be controlled such as climate, geography, and economic structure.
Who wins this year, and who loses? Tune in here next week for the 2016 report to see how the top energy-consuming countries fare in our energy efficiency rankings. A few surprises may be in order!

Want to increase your community’s resilience? ACEEE can help;"How is energy efficiency connected to community resilience? We answered that question in a report last year, Enhancing Community Resilience through Energy Efficiency. The report found that energy efficiency should be a core resilience strategy because it strengthens energy systems and the communities they serve by providing more reliable and affordable energy. Energy efficiency reduces a community’s vulnerability to an array of hazards and increases their capacity to cope when disruptions occur (check out this infographic for more details). Our resilience research is ongoing; we will present our next paper on this topic at the 2016 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings.
How ACEEE can help
Many communities are actively developing resilience plans or pursuing resilience activities (see  here, here, and here). Local governments, planning organizations, and other stakeholders in these communities might find hands-on assistance helpful. Today we are announcing a technical assistance opportunity to help them. We will be able to offer assistance to a small number of communities interested in using energy efficiency to increase their community resilience. For those selected, we can answer questions like: how should my community incorporate energy efficiency into its planning activities, or what types of energy efficiency should my community consider? Here are some of the ways we can assist:  
Participate in local convenings to discuss energy efficiency’s role in increasing community resilience
Review draft resilience plans and suggest how energy efficiency can be incorporated
Assist in prioritizing policies or programs and identifying relevant best practices
We will also work with partners in this effort. The Clean Energy Group’s Resilient Power Project works to catalyze the use of resilient power in low-income communities and vulnerable populations. They are a leading expert on the impact of solar and energy storage in increasing resilience. The Public Technology Institute provides support to local and county governments on a number of topics, including local energy assurance planning. Both organizations have unique expertise with synergies to our energy efficiency expertise. These partnerships not only streamline technical assistance offerings related to resilience and energy, but by teaming efficiency, solar, storage, and assurance planning expertise, they can amplify the impact of this opportunity. Energy efficiency is part of the solution, but a multi-faceted strategy can have a greater impact on resilience efforts.
How to contact us
If you are involved in resilience activities in your local government and are interested in having ACEEE help out, please send me a note at dribeiro@aceee.org by July 29. In your note, tell me about your community’s current commitment to resilience and other resilience activities under consideration. We will consider cities on a case-by-case basis, and prioritize those actively involved in resilience planning.

Progress on commercial building energy efficiency has been good, but more attention needed to decrease waste in several areas;"Data recently released as part of the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) highlights changes in commercial sector energy demand between 2003 and 2012. The Energy Information Administration conducts CBECS approximately every five years, and examines in depth a nationally representative sample of thousands of commercial buildings.  Overall, energy use per square foot of floor area is down by 12%. Great strides have been made in reducing energy use for lighting (see our previous blog post) and space heating. Regarding space heating, the reduction is due to both greater use of energy-saving technologies and practices, as well as higher growth in building floor area in the south, which accounted for 39% of commercial building floor area in 2012, up from 37% in 2003.
But it is also notable that some building energy end-uses have gone up over the past decade. As we have previously discussed, energy use for computers, office equipment, and “other” uses is up (see the figure below which highlights changes in energy use since 2003 by end-use). Use for cooking and refrigeration is also up, mirroring growth in the food service and food store sectors. We’re eating out more, and buying more prepared and refrigerated foods—data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that food store employment is up 12.7% over the past decade, more than double the growth in all employment. And cooling and ventilation energy use are also up, although the growth in cooling is very modest given the fact that CBECS found that 45% of all commercial new construction since 2003 has been in the south where cooling needs are particularly high. 
Total commercial energy consumption for lighting and other end-uses, 2003 and 2012
Source: EIA 2012 CBECS results
What does this mean for energy efficiency? These findings show that efficiency efforts can work, as shown for lighting and space heating. And cooling energy use growth would have been much greater if not for gains in cooling equipment efficiency and other cooling efficiency measures. But these findings also indicate that we need to pay more attention to areas of growing energy uses including cooking, refrigeration, ventilation, office equipment, and other miscellaneous uses. While efficiency progress has been made in these areas (e.g., efficiency standards for commercial refrigeration equipment and ENERGY STAR® programs for both commercial refrigeration and cooking), greater effort is needed. We need to better understand how this energy is used (a just released DOE report on commercial appliances should help), continue to develop new technologies and practices to reduce this use, and develop program and policy approaches to speed up dissemination of these new technologies and practices.  Progress on lighting and space heating help show that with added attention, we should be able to tame even these growing energy uses.

Pennsylvania’s large utility customers shouldn’t opt out of paying their fair share to reduce energy waste;"Currently there is an attempt in Pennsylvania’s statehouse to allow large utility customers to shirk their responsibility to reduce their energy waste. Senate Bill 805 would allow large industrial and commercial companies to opt out of Act 129, the Pennsylvanian statewide initiative to create a more energy-efficient economy. Similar ideas have been floated in the state before, but now things are moving fast and this week may see a decision on whether large customers are relieved of their responsibility to pay their fair share for energy efficiency investments that benefit the entire state.
Huge benefits could be endangered
Energy efficiency programs are largely paid for by ratepayers in the form of a small fee on their bills or a small amount embedded in their rates. These fees are then aggregated to fund cost-effective energy efficiency programs and projects across all sectors. These programs lead to huge benefits, especially when everyone participates. To date, Pennsylvania’s energy efficiency programs have created about 57,000 jobs within the state, and saved customers at all sizes more than $750 million on their electricity bills. Energy efficiency has significantly lowered the costs of electricity in Pennsylvania, and it is in the interest of all customers, large and small, to ensure that these investments continue.
But reaping the full benefits of energy efficiency could be in doubt if Senate Bill 805 goes through. When large utility customers opt out of efficiency programs, it affects everyone. Large customers represent a singular opportunity for low-cost energy savings for ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs. This opt-out legislation allows large customers to fully opt out of paying their energy efficiency fees with no corresponding obligation to make energy efficiency investments on their own. That means other customer classes will have to carry the full burden of meeting state efficiency targets, or if the targets are lowered, pay for the generation and transmission that will be needed to serve a less energy-efficient economy.
Opting out will decrease Pennsylvania’s expertise and knowledge base
An opt-out also means that large customers are ignoring an important opportunity. In general, investments in energy efficiency lower operating costs for manufacturers, which increases their productivity and improves competitiveness. When these investments are made through utility programs, businesses get the added value of access to technical expertise, project implementation support, and financial incentives that reduce initial costs. In effect, they invest in projects that they would not do on their own.
Supporters of such legislation may claim otherwise, but on multiple occasions we have debunked the reasons they give—myths if you will—for exempting large customers from contributing their share. Most recently in a series of fact sheets that describe the value of including industrial energy efficiency programs to a state’s efficiency and economic development efforts, and how to design effective energy efficiency programs for large customers. Over the years, our analysis has proven the cost effectiveness of energy efficiency in comparison to conventional resources.
Everyone should pay their fair share for benefits they enjoy
Pennsylvania currently ranks 17th in ACEEE’s 2015 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, rising three positions from 2014, a notable achievement. The state should be looking to advance, not backslide on its progress to deliver benefits to all residents by reducing energy waste. It is important for everyone who benefits to participate in making the Pennsylvania economy more energy-efficient. Allowing large customers to opt out will transfer their responsibility to other consumers and may increase the cost of electricity and decrease the number of jobs that could be created in the Keystone State.

Germany, Italy, and Japan Top World Energy Efficiency Rankings;"US Moves Up to #8 Spot Behind Spain and China, Rising From #13 Ranking in 2014; 3rdInternational Scorecard Evaluates 23 Largest Energy-Consuming Countries on 35 Categories.
WASHINGTON, DC – July 20, 2016 – Germany continues to lead the world in energy efficiency, followed by Italy and Japan (tied for second place), France, and the United Kingdom (not reflecting energy-related government changes in 2016), according to the 2016 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard published today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). New to the rankings this year are eight nations:  Indonesia, Netherlands, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. 
Now in its third edition, the ACEEE report (http://aceee.org/portal/national-policy/international-scorecard) finds that the United States rose in the international rankings from #13 in 2014 to #8 in 2016.
On a scale of 100 possible points in 35 categories, the nations were ranked by ACEEE as follows:  Germany (1), Italy (2, tied), Japan (2, tied), France (4), UK (5), China (6), Spain (7), South Korea (8, tied), United States (8, tied), Canada (10), Netherlands (11), Poland (12), Taiwan (13), India (14), Turkey (15), Australia (16), Russia (17), Indonesia (18), Mexico (19), Thailand (20), South Africa (21), Brazil (22), Saudi Arabia (23).
Together these countries represent 75% of all the energy consumed on the planet and over 80% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP).
The US rank was boosted by high scores in a number of new metrics added to the report for 2016, as well as improvements in energy intensity, or energy use per dollar of GDP. The US also benefited from changes to the scoring methodology, which now allocates more weight to policy actions. The ACEEE report outlines a number of international best practices that the US could implement to improve its score.
ACEEE evaluated each country using 35 policy and performance metrics spread over four categories: buildings, industry, transportation, and overall national energy efficiency efforts. Germany scored the most points in the national efforts, buildings, and industry categories, while India tied with Italy and Japan for first place in transportation.
ACEEE Executive Director Steven Nadel said: “Energy efficiency is often the lowest-cost means of meeting new demand for energy. Governments that encourage investment in energy efficiency and implement supporting policies save citizens money, reduce dependence on energy imports, and reduce pollution. Yet energy efficiency remains massively underutilized globally, despite its proven multiple benefits and its potential to become the single largest resource to meet growing energy demand worldwide.”
German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy Senior Advisor for General Issues of Energy Efficiency Georg Maue said: “Energy Efficiency plays a key role in Germany’s energy policy, the Energiewende, which aims to achieve a highly efficient and almost carbon neutral economy by 2050 at the latest. Our latest program, the National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency (NAPE), focuses on innovative industrial processes, energy-efficient buildings and products, and long-term investments. We are happy and grateful that ACEEE honors German efforts in its report. However, we will continue to step up our efforts, as there is a long way to go for us to reach our target of reducing the energy demand by 50% by 2050.”
Italian Ministry of Economic Development Head of Energy Efficiency Division Mauro Mallone said: “We are proud to have maintained the second position in this third edition of the 2016 ACEEE International Energy Efficiency Scorecard. The “silver medal” won by Italy is a recognition of the efforts made by the country to promote energy efficiency and accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy. This award is particularly appreciated as it comes from an independent assessment based on a complex set of policy and performance metrics.”
The ACEEE report notes that the United States, which improved its standing by tying with South Korea for 8th place, still has substantial room for improvement: “Despite its leadership on a number of policies, the United States falls behind most of the EU countries on our list in addition to China and Japan. The United States still has no binding energy savings goals, unlike Germany, France, Japan, and other countries which have a national energy conservation plan in place. The United States could take advantage of existing efficiency opportunities by mandating building energy use disclosure polices and categorical labels for appliances.”
Other possible areas of improvement for the US would be in passenger vehicle fuel economy, public transportation, the efficiency of freight transport, water efficiency policy, and requirements for large companies to conduct energy audits and hire energy managers.
ABOUT THE REPORT
The maximum possible score for a country was 100. ACEEE awarded 25 points each to the four categories: national efforts, buildings, industry, and transportation. Points were then allocated in each category based on how each country performed relative to others. ACEEE awarded the highest score available for a given metric to at least one country, which means that if any country were to emulate the top practices and results in each metric, it could obtain a score of 100. However, no country scored full points on all the metrics, indicating that all of them have room for improvement. The report’s scores and rankings were reviewed by experts from various countries.

ACEEE Statement on the Technical Assessment Report about fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and light truck;"Federal and California agencies’ Technical Assessment Report (TAR) released today is the first step in the mandatory “midterm review” of fuel economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and light trucks in model years 2022-2025. The review will be key to maintaining progress toward far cleaner and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks under landmark standards adopted in 2012. The standards have been bringing fuel efficiency technologies into the market at an impressive rate, delivering substantial savings to consumers.   
Recent statements from the auto industry indicate a desire to use the midterm review process to weaken the standards. But vehicle technology advances cited in the TAR indicate opportunities to strengthen them instead. With current low fuel prices, fuel economy standards become all the more important in ensuring the continued investment in efficiency technology that will be needed to reach the long-term goal of a sustainable transportation sector. And the standards are pegged to vehicle size, and hence self-adjust when sales shift towards larger vehicles.
Yet, meeting US obligations to dramatically lower greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades will require rapid—and absolute—reductions in car and light truck fuel consumption whatever the mix of vehicles sold. A successful midterm review will not only maintain momentum toward 2025 but also point the way toward further progress in the years beyond. This in turn will help automakers compete in a global market demanding continuously higher fuel efficiency and reduced emissions from tomorrow’s vehicles.     
We look forward to reviewing the draft TAR in detail and providing input to the next stage of the midterm review.

Celebrating 40 years of saving energy and training students in industrial efficiency;"ndustry has been important to the American economy since the earliest days of our country and the strength of the manufacturing sector is a priority for the US government and members of Congress. In a Senate briefing last week, staff on Capitol Hill attended a presentation celebrating the success of the Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC) program, a little-known and long-standing initiative funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) that helps small manufacturers save energy while training the next generation of energy efficiency engineers.
As part of the IAC program’s 40th anniversary, hill staffers from more than 10 Congressional offices convened for a briefing organized by Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to learn about the program’s achievements. Since the program was founded in 1976, teams of students at 24 of the top US engineering schools have conducted more than 17,000 free energy assessments, and helped small and medium-size manufacturers save more than $1 billion in energy costs and enough energy to power over 1.4 million homes. To emphasize these successes, Senator Shaheen and Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) submitted a formal recognition resolution commending the value the IAC program has brought to both manufacturers and engineering students.
Dr. Kathleen Hogan, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency for DOE, spoke at the briefing and described the program’s critical role within the department and shared her perspective on how we can ensure that the momentum continues for the next 40 years. IAC Technical Field Manager Dr. Michael Muller from Rutgers University and Dr. Sudhakar Neti, assistant director of the IAC at Lehigh University, also spoke at the event and shared stories about what it is like to work with students in the field. Another speaker, Bert Hill, manager at Volvo Group North America, explained the benefits his company received after IAC energy assessments were completed at five of their plants over the last three years.
A study commissioned by the DOE last year evaluated the performance of the program over fifteen years (1997–2013) and confirmed the measurable impact it has had on both energy savings and job skills development. The efficiency recommendations implemented by companies yielded over 480 MBTUs annually for every federal dollar spent, all while developing a pipeline of talented engineers who are trained in energy efficiency with skills that are highly valued in the job market. Several IAC student alumni who graduated from the program and work today as energy efficiency engineers also attended the briefing.
The future of the IAC program is bright and DOE is currently reviewing applications from universities to select which ones will host centers for the next five years. Hosting an IAC can have a large impact on a university and the territory that the center serves, so universities compete to host a center and partner with utilities, government, and local manufacturing groups to make compelling proposals. DOE will invest approximately $35 million in those centers over that five-year period.

Energy efficiency makes Clean Power Plan goals very achievable;"The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized state-specific limits on greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector. States can get most, if not all, of the emission savings they need by reducing the amount of electricity they are currently wasting. In the graph below, the light orange bars show that the listed states can achieve more than half of EPA’s 2030 limits with a few modest energy efficiency measures: 1% annual savings target, updated building codes, and 100 MW of new combined heat and power. The red bar shows the money saved by businesses and households when they spend less on their utility bills. In every single case, implementing efficiency measures costs LESS than building new generation to meet demand. All of this data comes from the SUPR2 calculator for states. It’s really easy to use. Try it out!

Energy efficiency lowers costs in recent PJM capacity auction;"Energy efficiency provides many benefits to the electric utility system. One of these benefits is reducing the market price for electric generation. PJM Interconnection, the operator of the largest electric grid in the United States serving approximately 61 million people, wrapped up its most recent generation capacity auction last week. This auction determines the price paid to power plants three years in the future. The clearing price in last week’s auction was far below expectations and nearly 40% below last year’s clearing price. This is in large part due to new natural gas power plants and energy efficiency.
Approximately 1,515 MW of energy efficiency cleared the auction, the largest amount ever. In terms of total clean energy alternative resources to clear the auction, energy efficiency had the highest amount of capacity, substantially more than solar (335 MW) and wind (969 MW). The complete results can be found here.
The results of this capacity auction are great news for two reasons. First, the result highlights how system planners are utilizing energy efficiency as resource able to provide sustained and predictable energy and reserves. The fact that energy efficiency cleared a substantial amount of megawatts under new requirements called “capacity performance” underscores the confidence of system planners in energy efficiency to reliably meet system load. 
Second, energy efficiency reduces costs for the entire PJM footprint. If efficiency had not participated in this auction, the clearing price would have been higher. While the economic value would have varied by resource zone (PJM is broken up into several geographical zones), many zones would have faced higher prices from other forms of generation. While the specific offer prices in the auction are confidential, Exelon (the largest utility company in the country) has publically stated two of its largest nuclear plants did not clear, meaning they are not economically competitive in the PJM marketplace. Given that energy efficiency savings are at the margin, these resources have provided substantial economic savings to millions of customers in the PJM footprint.
Capacity performance and why it’s important
The resources cleared as capacity performance included: approximately 139,000 MW or 89% of traditional generation (including solar and wind), 614 MW or 6% of demand response, and 1058 MW or 70% of energy efficiency.  Capacity performance is a new resource designation in the PJM footprint. It is a much more stringent requirement than in previous auctions. Essentially, it requires a resource to be “capable of sustained, predictable operation, and is expected to be available and capable of providing energy and reserves when needed throughout the entire delivery year.” The majority of efficiency resources met this requirement demonstrating efficiency can serve as a reliable system resource in the same way as nuclear, natural gas, or solar generation. 
Energy efficiency in prior PJM auctions
Energy efficiency has been participating as a resource in the PJM capacity market since 2009. The chart below shows the total amount of energy efficiency that cleared the last eight auctions. The delivery year is three years from the year of the auction. From delivery year 2012/2013 to 2019/2020, the level of energy efficiency resources clearing the auction has nearly tripled increasing from 568 MW to 1515 MW. These also only include efficiency that has not been reflected in the peak load forecast for the year in question, meaning there are additional savings not included.
Energy efficiency in future capacity markets
The level of energy efficiency to clear the PJM capacity market has increased nearly every year since 2009. This week’s auction emphasizes the critical role energy efficiency will play in the region as natural gas prices continue to reshape the national electric generation fleet. We expect the level of efficiency to clear this market to continue to grow in future auctions further suppressing the market prices for generating capacity in the region. This in turn will reduce system costs for customers for years to come.

"New York REVs up as commission includes efficiency in earnings opportunities; efficiency targets to be decided later";"Last week the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) released its final decision in Phase 2 of the Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) proceeding. REV is the New York initiative to reform the utility industry by building the rules that govern the utility system of the future. Phase 2 of the proceeding dealt mostly with financial issues, particularly how utilities can earn money. Several aspects of the decision affect energy efficiency, chiefly the inclusion of energy efficiency in an “earning adjustment mechanism” and a pledge to “develop targets for energy efficiency beyond [existing plans and targets].”
The heart of the decision is establishing two new earning opportunities for utilities – platform service revenues and earning adjustment mechanisms.
Platform service revenues
According to the decision, “[p]latform service revenues [PSRs] are new forms of utility revenues associated with operation and facilitation of distribution-level markets. In early stages, utilities will earn from displacing traditional [distribution] infrastructure projects with non-wires alternatives. As markets mature, opportunities to earn with PSRs will increase.” Among the non-wires alternatives utilities can use are energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation and storage.
Earning adjustment mechanisms
The new earning adjustment mechanism is a type of performance-based ratemaking—a system where utility earnings are adjusted up or down based on performance on specifically-defined metrics. The REV2 decision specifies four categories of earning adjustment mechanisms: system efficiency (achieving peak reduction and load factor improvement targets), energy efficiency (discussed below), customer engagement and information access (providing tools and opt-in rates and use of these tools and rates), interconnection (ease with which third-parties can connect to the grid). Additionally, the commission decided that affordability issues are important and will receive attention in other dockets. In addition to the energy efficiency metric, energy efficiency can contribute to the system efficiency metric and to addressing affordability issues.
For the energy efficiency category, the PSC specifies that one of the metrics should be based on electric usage intensity (e.g., electric use per customer), but that additional metrics can be developed, including ones based on program-specific savings, cost-savings, and innovative efficiency measures that address the PSC’s strategic goals. The next step in this process is for the Clean Energy Advisory Council (CEAC, a group of state officials, senior utility executives, and perhaps others) to develop recommendations on energy efficiency targets and earnings mechanisms for meeting and exceeding those targets. In another proceeding, the PSC has asked the CEAC to develop recommendations by the end of the year.
Looking beyond earnings
The decision also addresses greenhouse gas reductions, competitive market-based earnings and data access. The greenhouse gas section notes a separate Clean Energy Standard proceeding (addressing renewable and nuclear energy) but also says that “[u]tilities will… be encouraged to propose programs to accelerate the conversion of transportation and building end uses to efficient electric alternatives.” This provision could include efforts to promote electric vehicles or cold climate heat pumps. On competitive market-based earnings, the decision allows utility subsidiaries to compete in markets provided they meet five criteria specified in the decision (at page 49) and implement standards to avoid affiliate abuse. This provision might, for example, affect utility subsidiaries that develop combined heat and power systems at customer facilities. The data access section requires utilities to make certain basic data available for free but utilities may charge a fee for more refined data or analysis.
In addition, the decision also addresses rate-setting, encouraging residential opt-in time-of-use rates and specifying that future rate cases will examine ways to make demand charges for commercial and industrial customers more time-sensitive. The decision also asks PSC staff to work with stakeholders and report to the commission on possible residential opt-out variable rate scenarios including time-of-use rates, demand charges and peak-coincident demand charges. “Opt-in” means customers must make a proactive decision to enroll, which typically means low participation rates. “Opt-out” means customers are automatically enrolled, but can make a proactive decision to opt-out. Participation rates are generally much higher with opt-out.
Many decisions to be made later
Overall, the PSC decision contains some promising opportunities for energy efficiency, although how extensive the opportunities are will be determined over the balance of this year by the Clean Energy Advisory Council and subsequent PSC decisions addressing such issues as setting energy efficiency targets and earnings incentive mechanism details. ACEEE hopes that CEAC will recommend strong energy efficiency targets and earnings mechanisms, which is the combination ACEEE finds deliver the largest savings.

To check progress toward 2025 fuel economy targets, we took a look at the Ford F-150;"Recent press accounts of automobile fuel economy trends express concern that light trucks won’t be able to keep up with rising fuel economy (CAFE) standards. While most new model passenger cars are years ahead of their CAFE targets, only 40% new model pickups and SUVs are 2016 CAFE compliant. But sales of pickups and SUVs have surged in 2015, and this surge is likely to continue in 2016. Meanwhile, fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for cars and light trucks for model years 2022 through 2025 are under review. Will lagging pickups really pose an obstacle to meeting the 2025 fuel economy goals?
Since Ford’s F-Series has been the best-selling vehicle in America for 34 years, let’s take a look at the F-150 pickup (F-150 comes under light-duty CAFE, but not F-250 and F-350; they are heavy-duty vehicles). The F-150 has four engine options that, together with choice of two- or four-wheel drive,  affect fuel economy. Ford has garnered much attention in recent years for its downsized, turbocharged “Ecoboost” engines in the F-150 (among other nameplates) and a 700-lb. mass reduction across all F-150 models. Thanks to these and other changes, many F-150s meet or exceed their 2016 fuel economy targets. But others, like those with the 5.0L naturally aspirated engine, do not. Using a Ford projection of sales shares of the various engines and assuming that two-thirds of F-150s will have four-wheel drive, we estimate that the average fuel economy of all F-150s sold this year will be 24.2 miles per gallon (mpg), falling a bit short of their 2016 average fuel economy target of 24.7 mpg. Additional credits for air conditioning efficiency and other “off-cycle”technologies should allow Ford to close that ½-mpg gap and hit the F-150 target for 2016 without difficulty.
Looking forward to 2025, multiple technologies assessed by federal agencies in setting CAFE standards remain available to further increase fuel economy. All models can take advantage of advanced valve train technologies, greater transmission efficiency and shift optimization, aerodynamic drag reduction, low rolling resistance tires and further mass reduction, among others. Models with Ecoboost engines can adopt cooled exhaust gas recirculation. Start-stop technology, which saves fuel by shutting off the engine when the vehicle is at rest, is already standard with the 2016 2.7L Ecoboost engine, but will be new to the 3.5L Ecoboost starting in 2017.
Note: Fuel consumption reduction estimates for individual technologies are from NHTSA Final Regulatory Impact Analysis, August 2012
With the addition of the technologies shown in the above figure, all F-150 models except the 5.0L 4WD reach or exceed their average 2025 fuel economy target of 32.1 mpg (an estimate based on today’s size distribution of F-150s sold). Assuming the same shares for the four engines assumed for 2016 and two-thirds four-wheel drive, the entire F-150 line reaches its average target of 32.1 mpg in 2025 as shown in the figure below.
But in fact, Ford could substantially exceed the 2025 fuel economy target for the F-150.  We estimate that, if all models moved to turbocharged, downsized engines, for example, the F-150 could reach 34.1 mpg on average, 2.0 mpg over the 2025 target. Even if naturally aspirated engines remain in the line-up, they are likely to benefit substantially from advances such as high compression ratio and cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR).
So it looks like the F-150 could go well beyond its 2025 target using well-known technologies, with no vehicle electrification (beyond start-stop), and without even taking advantage of the multiple flexibilities in the program that make it easier for manufacturers to meet the standards. If the F-150 is any indication, the real question for the agencies’ review of the 2022-2025 CAFE standards is: can we do better than previously thought?

Explaining the unique energy burden of low-income households;"[Ed. note: see also ACEEE's updated energy burden report from 2020.]
In a recent report released by ACEEE and Energy Efficiency for All, Lifting the High Energy Burden in America’s Largest Cities, we measured energy burdens in 48 of the largest cities in the United States. Energy burden means the percentage of household income that goes toward energy costs, and we looked specifically at utility energy bills (transportation energy costs are also a significant household expense, but it was outside the scope of the analysis). We found that low-income, African American, Latino, and renters pay up to three times more than the average household on home energy costs. Higher energy burdens have real implications on the health and wellbeing of families and individuals. For example, the median income for low-income households in Memphis is around $19,000, and we found that they can spend upwards of $2,500 to $4,700 a year on their utilities. Families like these households, who have to devote higher proportions of their income to utility bills, may have to make trade-offs between heating and cooling their homes and affording other important necessities, such as food, medicine, and childcare.  
Lower incomes, less efficient housing, and limited access to energy efficiency programs can explain the higher energy burdens faced by these groups. We found that even though these families paid less overall on energy bills, they paid more per square foot, which indicates the relative inefficiency of their homes.
When analyzing energy burden, it’s important to look beyond averages and medians in order to better understand the burden faced by those worst-off economically. In this study, we also looked at the energy burden “quartiles” for each group (quartiles represent the middle value of the lowest half and upper half of the dataset).
The figure below illustrates the energy burden quartiles experienced by low-income households, indicated by the orange, green, and blue points. The dotted green line indicates the median energy burden for all households in our study, not just low-income households. Three-fourths of low-income households experienced an energy burden greater than the orange point (the lowest burden quartile), one-half of households experienced a burden greater than the green point (the median), and one-fourth of households experienced a burden higher than the blue point (the highest burden quartile). Take New Orleans for example: a quarter of low-income households in New Orleans experienced an energy burden greater than 19%. This is not unique. In 17 cities, a quarter of low-income households experienced an energy burden greater than 14%. This represents a significantly higher energy burden compared to the median energy burden across all cities in our sample, which was 3.5%, suggesting these low-income households devote a significantly higher portion of their income to utility bills.
What next? States, cities, and utilities can take action to address high energy burdens in their communities. Utility-funded energy efficiency programs are an underutilized strategy that can complement bill assistance and weatherization programs. To address high energy burdens, we suggest improving and expanding low-income utility programs by following the best practices laid out in our report, Building Better Energy Efficiency Programs for Low-Income Households. The same applies for the programs that serve multifamily buildings where building owners and managers experience unique barriers to upgrading housing stock with traditional efficiency measures and the majority of low-income residents are renters. We outline best practices for the delivery of multifamily energy efficiency programs in our report, Apartment Hunters: Programs Searching for Energy Savings in Multifamily Buildings. Utilities should also collect, track, and report demographic data on program participation in order to ensure that efficiency programs are meeting goals.
Cities and states can also work to ensure that cost-effectiveness testing of energy efficiency programs include multiple benefits and also that strong low-income savings goals are in place for both investor- and municipally-owned utilities. The Clean Power Plan also offers an opportunity for increased investment in low-income energy efficiency programs through the Clean Energy Incentive Program. Local stakeholders have many policy and program options to help those most in need in their communities to reduce their utility energy costs and alleviate energy burdens.

Oakland is living up to California’s high bar on energy efficiency, and then some;"Local governments of all sizes can invest days, months, and years into advancing energy efficiency programs and policies. Yet many go unrecognized for their efforts. Because the City Energy Efficiency Scorecard only covers 51 large cities, ACEEE created the Local Energy Efficiency Self-Scoring Tool so that any community can evaluate itself. Once a community has completed the tool, we can recognize their policy efforts in the State and Local Policy Database.
Oakland, California was the first city not covered by our Scorecard to complete the tool, and scored extremely well. Here are some of their highlights followed by a Q&A with a local government staff person.
Highlights from Oakland
A score of nearly 70 out of 100 would have earned Oakland a spot in the top ten of our 2015 City Scorecard were the city included. Oakland scored well in several policy areas, but its exemplary score can be attributed in part to its performance in a couple policy areas, namely transportation policies and actions to support efficiency efforts among energy and water utilities. In transportation, Oakland tied Arlington County, Virginia for the highest score of all cities we’ve assessed. Some of Oakland’s transportation-related achievements include: widespread availability of the AC transit and BART rail service and high regional spending on transit, a Green Fleet resolution to encourage efficient driving behavior, and active government participation in Oakland’s Clean Cities Coalition partnership. Oakland’s high score in energy and water utilities was due to several factors, including strong utility spending on electric and natural gas efficiency programs and Oakland’s support for these programs through the Local Government Sustainable Energy Coalition’s Energy Policy Committee.
A Conversation with Oakland
To share Oakland’s story, I corresponded with Daniel Hamilton, the Energy Program Director for the City of Oakland over email. The following exchange has been edited for clarity.  
Tyler Bailey: What have been the most effective energy efficiency programs Oakland has implemented that have saved the most energy?
Daniel Hamilton: Oakland participates in a range of regional programs to increase energy efficiency in buildings, the most effective of which is the single family and multifamily home retrofit programs of the Bay Area Regional Energy Network (BayREN). BayREN is a joint effort of the cities and counties of the San Francisco Bay Area, and has had great success in addressing the hard-to-reach market of existing residential buildings. Meeting our long-term efficiency goals requires greater penetration into the existing building stock, and working collaboratively with other local governments, rather than independently, has allowed us to manage programs like this at a scale that is much more effective.
TB: Based on your successes and experience with overcoming hurdles, what advice do you have for other localities working to improve energy efficiency?
DH: Cities have an unprecedented level of resources available to them now to support advanced energy efficiency policies and programs. Nonprofits like the New Buildings Institute and the Institute for Market Transformation, in addition to federal agencies like the Department of Energy, have developed comprehensive guides to assist cities in drafting ordinances, designing programs, and improving compliance and implementation. The ACEEE Scorecard criteria also provide a great framework for understanding the range of actions that a city can take to improve its energy performance and reduce its associated GHG emissions.
TB: Where do you see the greatest (untapped) potential for energy efficiency in Oakland and how are you working to tap that potential?
DH: There are two areas of greatest potential for Oakland to lower our energy consumption—energy conservation ordinances and community choice aggregation (CCA). The city adopted the Energy and Climate Action Plan which calls for the consideration of both residential and commercial energy conservation ordinances, and the city is pursuing multiple strategies for developing such ordinances in 2016. In addition, the city is participating in a countywide effort to form a community choice energy program, creating more renewable energy demand and a new provider of energy efficiency services. Developing these efforts into programs to be considered by the city council are key priorities in our efforts to substantially lower energy consumption and increase renewable energy generation in Oakland.

Why utilities are investing in this technology as a way to boost resiliency and reduce consumer costs;"What if there was a technology your utility could deploy today that was cheaper and cleaner than most existing power generation, that boosted system resiliency and reliability, and was twice as efficient? Would you want them to use it?
Customers of Duke Energy in North Carolina may soon enjoy these benefits. Duke Energy is just the latest example of utilities around the country that are investing in customer-sited combined heat and power (CHP) plants to bring cleaner, cheaper, and more quickly deployable energy resources to their customers. Duke has proposed to develop, own, and operate a 21 Megawatt (MW) CHP plant located at Duke University.
CHP is different from traditional power generation because the large amount of heat generated during the electric generation process is used, instead of wasted. Whereas traditional power plants dump their excess heat into the air or a nearby river or lake, CHP captures that heat and uses it for a productive purpose. In this case, the heat generated at the Duke plant will serve the university’s need for space heating, water heating, and steam for uses such as cleaning and sterilization at Duke University Hospital. The increased efficiency means the university will reduce its energy-related CO2 emissions by about 25%. And by siting CHP near the point of consumption, the utility reduces losses along transmission and distribution lines, which average over 7% but can climb as high as 20% during times of peak system use.
While the university itself stands to benefit from this arrangement, the project was given the go-ahead by the utility in large part due to the benefits to all users of Duke Energy’s system. The 21 MW of new capacity is more cost-effective than other supply alternatives the utility considered, and can come online faster than most other types of power generation. The power generated by the new plant will serve both the university, as well as the surrounding Durham community.
Duke Energy is not alone in tapping CHP for its near-term energy needs. Other utilities have realized that siting distributed CHP power plants at customer locations can bring benefits to the whole system. In Texas, Austin Energy owns a 4.3 MW CHP system located near Seton’s Dell Children’s Medical Center, providing low-cost and highly reliable power and thermal energy to the hospital and nearby buildings. In Florida, Florida Public Utilities (FPU) is developing a 20 MW CHP system located at a Rayonier Advanced Materials cellulose plant. Rayonier will use the steam in its production process, and the power will serve FPU’s nearby customers on Amelia Island. The plant is expected to save FPU customers $28 million over the 20-year contract period. State regulators were very enthusiastic about the project, and are hoping to see others like it.
In addition to the efficiency and emissions reduction benefits, utilities and customers are increasingly recognizing the reliability benefits of CHP and viewing it as critical infrastructure for staying online in even the worst weather events. Given so many benefits, it is natural to wonder why we don’t see more CHP owned by utilities as supply-side assets. One reason is that utilities do not usually consider CHP in their long-term resource planning efforts. That situation is changing as more and more states identify CHP as an important option to be considered alongside traditional generation. Indeed, Duke Energy has indicated that the CHP plant at Duke University is just one of possibly four additional customer-sited CHP developments it plans in the near future. Stay tuned as ACEEE continues to explore the emerging role of CHP as a distributed utility resource.

Huge progress on lighting efficiency improvements;"Several recent sets of data show large improvements in lighting energy efficiency in recent years. First, DOE has commissioned two US Lighting Market Characterization studies – one with data on installed lighting in 2001, the other with data on installed lighting in 2012. Figure 1 compares these two studies for the residential sector, showing how conventional incandescent lamps declined from 69% of total annual light provided in 2001 to 49% in 2010. In 2010, fluorescent lamps (tubes and compact fluorescent lamps) plus halogen and other lamps accounted for more than half of the lighting provided to US homes.
  Figure 1. Residential lighting, percent of total annual lumen-hours in 2001 and 2010 by lamp type. Source: ACEEE analysis of DOE data from here and here.
The residential lighting mix continues to change rapidly. Figure 2 shows the distribution of A-line screw-in lamp sales by year using data compiled by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (A-line means the standard pear-shaped light bulb). Standard incandescent lamps declined from nearly 75% of lamp sales in 2011 to only 8% of lamp sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 in which half of sales were halogen lamps, 23% were compact fluorescent lamps, and 17% were LEDs (light-emitting diode lamps).
  Figure 2. Distribution of screw-in A-line lamp sales by lamp type, 2011-2015. Source: National Electrical Manufacturers Association (see here).
Comparable trends can be seen in data for the commercial sector. Figure 3 summarizes data for lighting in the commercial sector in 2001 and 2010. “T12” lamps (1.5 inches in diameter and typically using 34 or 40 watts of power) declined from 69% to 49% of light provided, while “T8” and “T5” lamps (1 and 5/8 inch diameters and typically using 26-32 watts of power) increased from 25% to 55% of lighting provided.
  Figure 3. Commercial lighting, percent of total annual lumen-hours in 2001 and 2010 by lamp type. Source: ACEEE analysis of DOE data from here and here.
The large energy savings that result are shown by recently released data from the 2012 Energy Information Administration (EIA) Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). EIA found that commercial building lighting energy use declined by 46% from 2003 to 2012, as shown in Figure 4, even though EIA also found that commercial building floor area increased by 22% over this period.
  Figure 4. Total commercial energy consumption for lighting and other end-uses, 2003 and 2012. Source: EIA 2012 CBECS results.
These four figures show recent trends, but lighting continues to rapidly evolve. Figure 5 looks at the saturation of LED lighting in different applications on a market diffusion curve. Some applications are now largely LED, such as exit signs and refrigerator case lighting. In all likelihood, even applications with low LED penetration currently, such as linear fixtures and decorative lighting will move steadily up the market diffusion curve in coming years.

Want to improve your multifamily energy efficiency program? Our new report shows you the way;"Multifamily buildings are home to millions of people across the US. In fact, multifamily buildings make up one quarter of the housing stock. These buildings range from duplexes with five or six units to high-rises with more than 50. Most properties are leased to residents, while others are owned by their occupants. Rental buildings can be owned by mom-and-pop landlords or companies that own and operate hundreds of buildings nationwide. These are just some of the factors utilities and other program implementers must consider when designing energy efficiency programs for the multifamily sector.
Since 2013, ACEEE has been working to help multifamily buildings save energy as part of our Multifamily Energy Savings Project. The project aims to improve and expand utility energy efficiency programs that target multifamily housing. Our new report, Reaching More Residents: Opportunities for Increasing Participation in Multifamily Energy Efficiency Programs, builds upon existing research and identifies the strategies that energy efficiency programs designed for multifamily housing use to achieve high participation.
What did we find?
We collected information from all types of energy efficiency programs for multifamily housing from across the country. For data, we turned to our Multifamily Utility Working Group, consisting of multifamily energy efficiency program administrators from electric and gas utilities. We analyzed 30 programs to identify those with high participation and interviewed administrators to learn how they reach their customers.
We found that programs serve anywhere from 1,700 units to over 54,000 units every year and reach 1% to 26% of their eligible customers annually. However, most programs only serve a small percentage of their eligible customers in multifamily housing allowing for plenty of opportunities for programs to expand their reach. There are many factors that determine the number of customers a program reaches and how much energy is saved. The comprehensiveness of a program and its budget can affect the number of customers served. Whole-building programs typically reach fewer customers but achieve higher energy savings per unit than those that rely on simpler direct install measures. Regardless of program type, participation matters. We found that programs, both new and old, are applying effective strategies to reach more customers in multifamily buildings.
Successful strategies
The Bay Area Regional Energy Network’s (BayREN) multifamily energy efficiency program in California is one of the newest programs highlighted in our report. Although BayREN only served a modest number of customers in its first year, it far exceeded its participation goals and already has tens of thousands of units waiting to participate in the program. BayREN credits the high interest in its program to its combination of savvy marketing strategies and partnerships with local city and county governments.
Austin Energy’s multifamily energy efficiency program in Texas is one of the most established programs we analyzed, having served over 40% of its customers in multifamily housing over the last decade. They attribute much of their success to building relationships with the multifamily housing community, including the Austin Apartment Association. Establishing relationships with building owners helps Austin Energy create interest in their program. Austin Energy’s next goal is reaching more of its low-income customers in multifamily buildings. They are currently in the process of launching a new program designed specifically for these customers.
Some programs, like the District of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility’s (DCSEU) Low-Income Multifamily Initiative are already targeting low-income customers. DCSEU serves roughly 5% of its income-eligible customers every year and achieves a notably high per unit energy savings. This program not only works to save energy, but it also preserves affordable housing and reduces utility costs for the city’s most vulnerable communities.
If I’m a program administrator, how can I reach more of my customers?
The programs highlighted above are just a few of the many examples of successful strategies we call out in the report. Although each program puts a unique twist on their marketing and outreach strategies, we identify six practices that programs can use to reach more customers in multifamily housing. These best practices include:
Simplifying access to program services
Targeting decision makers
Tailoring marketing to specific segments of the market
Partnering with state and local housing organizations to market and deliver programs
Partnering with trade allies to market programs
Delivering effective messages that demonstrate value with actionable guidance
What’s next?
The findings of this report show that multifamily energy efficiency programs can serve high numbers of customers and achieve substantial energy savings. We also recognize that better data are needed to assess the reach and scope of energy efficiency programs serving customers in multifamily buildings. At ACEEE we are committed to continuing this research to help ensure more customers in multifamily buildings and the communities where they reside benefit from energy efficiency.

Should we promote heat pumps to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions?;"Heat pumps are going through a period of innovation including more wide-spread availability of ductless heat pumps, development of cold climate heat pumps, higher minimum efficiency standards for heat pumps, and development of gas-fired heat pumps. Heat pumps are generally fairly efficient as they extract heat from the air, even cold air. A typical new heat pump in the United States is on average roughly twice as efficient as electric resistance heat, although performance varies with climate. While heat pumps can be efficient, they are also more expensive than many types of heating systems, and they generally don’t work well at very cold temperatures. 
More than 2% of residential energy use can be saved
In order to examine which applications are good for obtaining cost-effective energy savings from heat pumps, ACEEE conducted a pair of analyses that we are releasing today. One addresses opportunities to replace electric resistance heat with heat pumps and the other addresses replacing gas furnaces with heat pumps. Both analyses use data on actual energy consumption in homes throughout the US collected as part of the Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). Our analysis of replacing electric resistance heat with heat pumps finds an opportunity to reduce residential sector electricity use nationwide by more than 2%. Additional energy would be saved from using heat pumps instead of gas furnaces in some important applications. Furthermore, multiple analysts (e.g., here and here) see electric heat pumps powered with clean electricity as an important strategy for displacing emissions from in-home combustion of fossil fuels.
For our analysis of converting homes with electric resistance heat to heat pumps, we used data on space heating energy use in a representative sample of nearly 2,000 homes in RECS now using electric resistance heat. This analysis looked at replacing both electric furnaces (which distribute heat via ducts) and electric baseboard heat (heating coils along the baseboard in each room) with heat pumps. Electric furnaces are particularly common in the south but are uncommon in the north. Nearly 90% of homes with electric furnaces already have central air conditioning. We found that installing a new heat pump at the time the existing central air conditioner needs replacement will generally be cost-effective, with the median simple payback period (time for the energy savings to fully pay back the additional cost) being 4.7 years. The distribution of simple payback periods is shown in the figure below. Economics were similar for the 17% of homes with electric baseboard heat that also have central air conditioning. But for homes without central air conditioners, the cost to install a heat pump is higher, and the median simple payback was nearly 15 years, although just over 10% of homes have simple payback periods of five years or less.
Distribution of simple payback periods for heat pump conversions for homes with electric furnaces and central air-conditioning. These figures are for single-family homes and multifamily buildings with two to four units per building. This distribution applies the weighting factors in the RECS sample.
For our analysis of replacing gas furnaces with heat pumps, we looked at average space heating energy use of homes with gas furnaces in each of 20 states. We compared the gas used by gas furnaces with the gas used at the power plant to operate a heat pump. For each state, we looked at a variety of furnace, heat pump, and power plant efficiency levels. We also looked at the relative economics for many of the comparisons. We found that electric heat pumps generally use less energy in warm states and have moderately positive economics in these states if a heat pump can replace both the furnace and a central air conditioner. Moderately cold states (as far north as Pennsylvania and Massachusetts) can save energy if electricity comes from the highest-efficiency power plants, but from an economic point of view, life cycle costs for gas furnaces in existing homes will be lower than for heat pumps in these states. (We did not look at new construction where using electric heat and hot water can avoid the need to install gas service.)  For cold states (colder than Massachusetts and Pennsylvania), high-efficiency furnaces use less energy than today’s heat pumps, but further development of cold-temperature electric heat pumps and gas-fired heat pumps will be useful from an energy-saving point of view.
Next steps needed to realizing savings
Based on these analyses, we recommend the following next steps:
State officials and utilities should conduct further analysis at the state, local, and utility levels. More nuanced analysis at the utility or local level, based on specific rate schedules and climate zones, will more clearly indicate who might benefit from heat pumps and who will not.
Manufacturers and R&D organizations should continue work to develop good cold-climate electric air-source heat pumps and gas-fired heat pumps.
Energy efficiency program administrators should consider programs to encourage use of heat pumps in warm states, starting with further localized analysis and proceeding to pilot programs.
More localized analysis is needed, but our analyses find likely opportunities to save energy and money and reduce emissions by using electric heat pumps, particularly in warm states.

Making sense of commercial-sector energy use data;"Commercial-sector energy use in the US increased by 63% from 1979 to 2012, rising from total source energy use of 10.6 quads in 1979 to a peak of 18.4 quads in 2008 before declining to 17.4 quads in 2012.  This growth can largely be attributed to a corresponding increase in commercial building floor area, which grew by 70% over the same period. But that is only part of the story. As the graph below illustrates, as floor area has trended upward over time, energy use per square foot has gone up and down, peaking in the 1999-2003 period but declining since then. As of 2012, energy use per square foot was 4% lower than 1979.  
Commercial building floor area and energy consumption per square foot, 1979-2012
  Source: ACEEE analysis based on EIA data from the Monthly Energy Review and the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey
Why is that? Reductions in energy use per square foot are due in part to improvements in the efficiency of new construction and key end-use equipment, a shift to less energy-intensive building uses, and higher growth in more temperate regions. At the same time, some of the improvement in energy use per square foot (which we report on a source energy basis) is offset by the significant increase in electricity use in commercial buildings, which has doubled since 1979 while other fuel usage has remained flat.
While these data begin to sketch a picture of the broader landscape of commercial sector energy use trends, we need more details to understand which technologies, practices, and policies are driving changing energy performance in individual buildings. EIA recently released preliminary consumption data from the 2012 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). This long-awaited and highly-anticipated data comes almost a decade after the last CBECS survey for 2003. In the coming months as the full dataset is released, we’ll dig in and report further insights on the most important efficiency trends in commercial buildings.

Can energy efficiency rise to its $279 billion potential and help meet climate goals?;"Energy efficiency financing has seen record growth over the past year. Property-assessed clean energy (PACE) hit a billion dollar milestone, the nation’s largest green bank has roughly $4 billion of projects in the pipeline, and green bond issuance grew from $3 billion four years ago to over $40 billion in 2015. Total energy efficiency investment in buildings is slated to reach $125 billion by 2020, which is still less than half of the estimated $279 billion available.
But is it enough? On one hand, the market is telling us that we are poised to leave hundreds of billions of dollars on the table, while the Paris climate negotiations earlier this year set investment targets of over $200 billion to help avoid climate change. Energy efficiency financing is growing fast, but can it grow fast enough?
Green banks have emerged to meet the demand previously unmet by cash-strapped public enterprises and risk-wary private ones. They are facilitating billions of dollars of investment and growing nascent program to scale, but there are just a handful of them and many are nascent programs themselves.
PACE has seen astounding success in the past year, but all that success is still a fraction of its potential. Of the 32 states with enabling legislation, only 16 have active programs, and the vast majority of projects are being done in just one.
For this reason, green banks and PACE are headlining this year’s ACEEE Energy Efficiency Finance Forum in Newport, Rhode Island. These two topics exemplify the theme of this year’s conference, “going deep,” as they have both just scratched the surface of their potential. In order to scale, we need deep energy efficiency retrofits as well as deep market penetration. We need to move beyond swapping out light bulbs and reaching only early adopters.
At this year’s conference we explore all facets of the industry: residential; commercial; multifamily; and the municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals sector. Within these tracks we will feature case studies of successful financial programs and products so that you can apply these concepts in your own companies and communities. Covering utility programs, different lease agreements, and all types of energy performance contracts, this year’s Finance Forum will spread myriad success stories.
To shed more light on these topics, we will be joined by Rhode Island general treasurer Seth Magaziner who will give the opening plenary speech. Massachusetts energy secretary Matthew Beaton will cross state lines from the top-ranked state in energy efficiency to give Monday’s luncheon address. Tuesday morning, Judith Greenwald, deputy director for climate, environment, and energy efficiency from the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis (EPSA) will talk about the Quadrennial Energy Review.
We’d welcome you joining in the discussion. There’s still time to register and book a room at conference rates. Please visit our Finance Forum web page for more information. See you in Newport!

A DOE budget request sheds light on the future of advanced manufacturing;"The Department of Energy’s 2017 budget request was released back in February, and is now awaiting congressional approval. The request included $261 million for the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO), the part of DOE that focuses on energy use in the manufacturing sector. It does so by bringing together manufacturers, research institutions, suppliers, and universities to promote manufacturing clean energy products and implementing best practices. The increase, over prior years, of the AMO budget allocation demonstrates a continuing interest and commitment by the federal government to invest in energy efficiency in the industry sector, especially in helping energy-intensive manufacturers reduce their energy use and develop new, energy-efficient technologies, processes, and products.
Industrial priorities in the AMO budget
The AMO budget request is divided into three subprograms: Advanced Manufacturing R&D Projects ($102.5 million), Advanced Manufacturing R&D Facilities ($129 million), and Industrial Technical Assistance ($29.5 million). The R&D Projects subprogram request includes $10 million for projects at the Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at Oak Ridge National Lab, and the bulk of the budget, $40 million, would be invested in competitive solicitations. The R&D Facilities subprogram plans to concentrate its efforts on new and continued funding for Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, specifically highlighting the first annual payment for a new Energy-Water Desalination Hub. The Technical Assistance subprogram allocates $10 million each in continuing support for the Combined Heat and Power Technical Assistance Partnerships and the Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs).
The request continues a long history of government support for industrial energy efficiency and advanced manufacturing. The graph below compares annual investment in AMO activities dating back to 1998 (adjusted to 2015$) and a breakdown of the programs funded. The 2017 request represents a 14% increase over last year’s allocation for AMO and is one piece of the administration’s overall request for a 40% increase for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. While the budget allocations have fluctuated over the years, this year’s request represents a firm commitment by DOE to invest in the development of energy-saving research and technology.
What we learned from AMO’s director
Earlier this month, AMO’s director, Dr. Mark Johnson, shared more details on the office’s future plans during a meeting of ACEEE’s industrial working group. Dr. Johnson highlighted upcoming efforts relating to water desalination, specifically encouraging the development of technology, scientific research, and manufacturing that can increase the efficiency of desalination without an increase in cost or energy usage. He also emphasized the work of the IAC program, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary. Through the program, teams at 24 of the top US engineering schools have conducted more than 16,000 energy assessments, helping manufacturers save more than $1 billion in energy costs, enough energy to power 1.4 million homes. A solicitation is currently open to determine which universities will host the 24 IACs for the next five years, and DOE will invest approximately $35 million in those centers over that period.
If you’re interested in becoming involved in ACEEE’s industrial working group, send an email to industry@aceee.org and request an invitation to join. The group is an informal committee of stakeholders that convenes periodically, primarily to discuss federal policy issues affecting the industrial sector.
Industrial topics in this year’s Better Buildings Summit
AMO staff and industry partners will showcase best practices and leading energy efficiency solutions at DOE’s upcoming 2016 Better Buildings Summit in Washington, DC. The Summit will be held on May 9–11, and will include 900 participants and speakers from the commercial, industrial, public, multifamily, residential, and data center sectors. Industrial topics will cover water-saving technology and projects, smart manufacturing, data analysis, and energy savings related to heating/cooling, steam, pumps, process heating, and compressed air. Dr. Johnson and ACEEE’s senior director for research, Neal Elliott, will be featured panelists on the first day of the summit, during the Better Plants Partner Meeting: Key Trends and Future Directions in Industrial Energy Efficiency session. Other staff from the ACEEE Industry Program will participate in panels, including Ethan Rogers, who will discuss supply chain efficiency, and Christopher Russell, who will discuss how to value the multiple benefits of efficiency.

Want to use energy efficiency to benefit low-income communities in planning for the Clean Power Plan? We’ve got a guide for that.;"The Clean Power Plan may be stayed, but the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continues to guide states who are considering their compliance options. This morning, EPA indicated its commitment to moving ahead with the Clean Power Plan by sending a proposal on the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) to the Office of Management and Budget. The CEIP is a program that would provide states with extra credit for using energy efficiency in low-income households and communities to reduce emissions prior to the compliance period.
In an ACEEE white paper released today, we guide states through designing and implementing low-income energy efficiency programs and investments. We focus on approaches that are well suited for credit under the CEIP and for helping states achieve their overall emission limits under the CPP. Consistently a cost-effective option for meeting electricity demand, keeping electricity bills low, and reducing environmental compliance costs, energy efficiency is a great way for states to meet a significant portion of their Clean Power Plan targets. States with high poverty rates particularly stand to benefit from low Clean Power Plan compliance costs, so it’s important for them to think carefully about compliance strategies that will reduce low-income households’ energy burden and generate benefits for their communities.
The value of energy efficiency in low-income households and communities
The Clean Power Plan offers an excellent opportunity for states to set up long-term strategies to benefit the communities most in need. Recent ACEEE research has illustrated that low-income families face a distinct energy burden, spending a larger portion of their income on utility bills than the general population. Because of that, energy efficiency can make a big difference to those families. Energy efficiency keeps electricity affordable and improves low-income families' quality of life. Many businesses and community-based organizations that serve low-income households also stand to benefit from energy efficiency projects, which reduce their operating expenses and spur local economic development. It’s important for state regulators and program administrators to consider the best way to meet the needs of those communities by keeping compliance costs low and investing in energy efficiency in low-income neighborhoods. We lay out the elements of the most successful energy efficiency programs for low-income residents in a report published last month. Now, it’s time for states to think even bigger. By expanding energy efficiency programs and investments for people at all income levels, states will harness untapped energy and emission savings, laying a strong foundation for success.
Next steps for states
States don’t need to start from scratch when it comes to making plans for energy efficiency in low-income communities. Instead, they can draw upon the great resources already available to them. As our best practice guide lays out, public housing authorities, housing finance agencies, affordable housing organizations, and other energy efficiency program managers can help state air offices understand how energy efficiency programs and investments designed for low-income communities are delivered, and how they can be improved. In turn, state air regulators can incentivize these programs in their compliance plan and participate in the CEIP to earn extra compliance credit for early emission reductions from energy efficiency programs for low-income households. By working together to include programs for low-income communities in their state’s compliance plan, air offices and the affordable housing community will create a sense of permanence for these programs and investments, and they will open the door for any additional funding that becomes available for compliance efforts.
Leveraging energy efficiency in Clean Power Plan compliance
There are many ways that states can use energy efficiency to lower the cost of compliance with air regulations. ACEEE’s best practice series highlights several of the energy efficiency policies and programs that states should consider. The first paper describes the steps states can take to develop a compliance plan and use energy efficiency as a core strategy. The second paper helps states lead by example through energy efficiency in public buildings. Today’s paper on implementing and evaluating investments and energy efficiency programs for low-income communities is our newest addition to the series. From webinars to compliance planning tools, stay tuned as ACEEE continues working to help states take full advantage of opportunities to increase their energy efficiency.

Intelligent efficiency & continual commissioning;"One of the more vexing challenges for those in the energy efficiency program sector is ensuring that savings resulting from the implementation of an efficiency measure persist over time. Fortunately, a solution exists: intelligent efficiency can prevent the degradation of energy savings, and in some instances increase savings over time.
The Challenge
Imagine you’re a building operator with a complex building management system. You’ve become accustomed to the decline in energy savings that often occurs in the months and years following the implementation of an energy efficiency measure. As time goes by, the tenants in your building change, old walls come down, and new walls go up. The ductwork on a floor that supplied air to one large room now supplies air to several smaller ones. The programming that once optimized energy use has been turned off or overridden. Your tenants all keep different hours, have different equipment, and hold different expectations of the building. Without changes to the design and controls of the lighting, heating, cooling, and hot water systems, to adapt to these changes, one or more of the systems may operate against the interests of the tenants. Perhaps they suffer with it for a while, but ultimately they begin to adjust thermostats and install work-arounds such as closing off air supply vents, overriding programs on programmable thermostats, and opening windows. These changes induce a response from the system that exacerbate the situation. A negative feedback loop is created that moves the system further away optimal energy use.
Energy Savings of Continual Commissioning
Now, look at the figure, and assume a new energy efficiency measure has been installed in your building. Say, a programmable thermostat. The initial change in energy use and its subsequent increase is captured in the first part. When first programmed, the thermostat is likely to reduce energy use, because it enables the user to reduce the level of cooling or heating during hours when a building is not occupied. But this level of savings is likely to be lost once the needs of the building change, because rather than reprogram the thermostat, operators are likely to bypass the programming and set the temperature manually. The energy use that had been going down now trends back up and savings degrade.
The energy use may not return to pre-implementation levels because some energy measures are more sustainable than others. New, more efficient lighting will, more often than not, permanently reduce the energy use of a building, regardless of hours of operation.
Also captured in the figure is the common experience of a building receiving occasional upgrades. With each upgrade, energy consumption falls. And then, over time, savings degrade as devices drift out of spec, building needs change, and programming is overridden. A new project is implemented and the trend continues. To address this issue and to realize greater savings, homeowners, building operators, and program administrators are turning to more advanced building management systems.
Intelligent Efficiency and Programs
Reducing or eliminating the degradation of savings is not only important to building operators, it is important to energy efficiency programs because the persistence of savings is key to meeting their savings targets and obligations. Savings degradation is a common issue in whole-building retrofit programs. To ensure the persistence of savings, programs are investing in learning thermostats for residential programs, and advanced building management systems for commercial programs, which utilize machine learning and historical building operating information to identify trends and optimal operating conditions. Data analytics enable these systems to not only maintain savings, but to actually increase them. They can also adapt to changing conditions and adjust equipment settings more quickly than human operators. The result is a building that is at or near optimal operating conditions a majority of the time.
In the figure, we can see the difference in energy consumption between re-commissioning and continual optimization. With re-commissioning, the periodic optimization of building systems is followed by degradation of savings and the need for repeated re-commissioning. With continual optimization, the savings increase over time as the control systems learn how to refine operations.
The pattern captured in the figure is relevant to many other intelligent efficiency measures. Any compressed air, water, ventilation system, or industrial process can realize the same saving gains through continual optimization. The ability to capture energy savings that would normally be lost to degradation of savings is a key benefit of intelligent efficiency.

This Earth Day, let’s look at how much energy we’ve been using.;"Earth Day was first celebrated in 1970, and that got us thinking about how households used energy back then. What did they use it for? Do we follow the same conventional wisdom for saving energy in our homes today, even though there are some obvious differences in the types of devices we use now?  We were curious to dig in and see how energy use has changed over the past 35+ years, and how that change shapes our efforts to conserve.
Let’s travel back to the 1980s, when the first comprehensive survey of US residential energy use was published, to get an idea of how the average American household was using energy at the time. Microwaves were just beginning to gain popularity (14% of households had one) and personal computers were so rare that a question about them didn’t even appear on the survey. Ten years later in 1990, almost 80% of households had microwaves and 70% of households had personal computers (EIA 2015). From there the number of electronics and other miscellaneous loads have only continued to grow (AEO 2015).
Meanwhile, heating and air conditioning systems and major appliances are becoming more efficient during this time period, and new homes are being built with more insulation and more efficient windows. Between the late 1980s and late 2000s the share of household energy used to heat and cool a house shifted from a majority of the overall load (61%) to less than half (48%). Over the same time period the share of energy used for appliances, lighting, electronics, and other miscellaneous energy loads swelled from 23% to 35% (EIA 2013, 1987).
Source: EIA 1987, EIA 2009
  During this time, lighting and major appliances on the market were getting more efficient, largely thanks to energy efficiency standards, so why the big increase? You can probably think of more than a few devices that are common in homes today that did not exist in the 1980s. While no single device is a particular energy guzzler, in sum their cumulative impact adds up.
So what can we learn from these statistics to help save energy in our own homes? Now more than ever, we need to address a variety of end uses to help chip away at the cost of our energy bill. While heating and cooling loads are still important to address, especially in hot and cold climates (need insulation and air sealing? Here’s how to get it done right), we need to consider a range of energy end uses. Drawing from ACEEE’s energy efficiency consumer resource, smarterhouse.org, we offer a few recommendations for how you can make smart energy choices in your own home.
Addressing growing electric use requires a variety of strategies. Smarterhouse.org provides a number of ideas for addressing the energy use of the home electronics you already have, and for making smart decisions when purchasing new ones. There are efficient options for products including TVs, computers, set top boxes, and audio equipment. Look for the ENERGY STAR® rating to get the most efficient model. 
Major appliances like clothes washers, refrigerators, and dishwashers are much more efficient than they were in the 1980s. If you’re still hanging onto an old appliance, it makes financial sense to replace it (and, if it’s the second, spare fridge in the garage, consider whether you really need it—if the extra fridge space is a must, replace it with a high efficiency model). Today’s models are so much more efficient than they were in the 1980s (and even the 1990s) that the return on your investment won’t take long. For example, average energy use for refrigerators decreased by almost 70% between 1980 and 2014. If you replace your 1980s refrigerator with a new ENERGY STAR model you would save about $200 a year. Find buying tips here.
Saving energy in your home in the most cost-effective way possible requires planning and coordination. Getting ready to do a home improvement or remodel? Need to replace a major appliance? Here’s how you can incorporate energy efficiency into your project to be sure to invest in products and improvements that will save you over their lifetime.
Unless it’s not working and you’re stuck taking a cold shower, the water heater is not an appliance that people think much about. Instead of waiting for it to break, do some research now to figure out what the most efficient option is for your home. High efficiency electric heat pump water heaters are increasingly common and readily available, and use 50% less energy than a standard electric tank. That amounts to about $200 of energy savings annually, and well over $1000 over the lifetime of the unit. Find heat pump water heaters rated by ENERGY STAR here.

In celebration of Earth Day this year, we encourage you to commit to acting on some of these energy saving recommendations that can both save you money and cut down on energy waste.

ACEEE Commends Senate on Passage of the Energy Policy Modernization Act;"Statement by Steven Nadel, Executive Director
After months of discussion, the Senate finally passed a bill with energy efficiency provisions that could help power our economy for years to come. The energy bill passed by the Senate moves the ball forward on energy efficiency, toward consumer energy bill savings, more jobs, and cleaner air. This bill will especially help state and local governments implement effective building energy codes and other policies to save Americans money. It will help many middle-income families finance energy improvements in their homes and earn the benefits of energy savings. And it will foster innovation in smart buildings and smart manufacturing to make American companies more competitive. We commend Senators Murkowski, Cantwell, Portman, Shaheen and many others for their steadfast bipartisan work on this bill. The next step should be enactment of the good energy efficiency provisions from both the Senate and House bills (while leaving a couple of harmful and contentious provisions behind).
  The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.

Report: “Energy Burden” on Low-Income, African American, & Latino Households up to Three Times as High as Other Homes, More Energy Efficiency Needed;"Data Gauge Impact of Energy Costs on Low-Income, African-American, Latino, and Renter Residents; Low-Income Households in Memphis, Birmingham, Atlanta, New Orleans, Providence, Pittsburgh, Dallas, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Cleveland Suffer Heaviest “Energy Burden”  
[Note: see ACEEE's updated energy burden report from 2020]
WASHINGTON, D.C.—An “energy burden” review of 48 major U.S. metropolitan areas finds that low-income households devote up to three times as much income to energy costs as do other, higher-income households. The new report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) and the Energy Efficiency for All (EEFA) coalition also finds that African-American and Latino households spend disproportionate amounts of their income on energy and that more energy efficiency measures would help close the gap by at least one-third.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Voces Verdes participated with ACEEE and EEFA in today’s release of the report, which is available online at http://aceee.org/research-report/u1602.
Key findings from “Lifting the High Energy Burdens in America’s Largest Cities: How Energy Efficiency Can Improve Low-Income and Underserved Communities” include the following:
On average, low-income households pay 7.2 percent of household income on utilities – more than three times the amount that higher income households pay (2.3 percent).
Energy burdens were found to be greatest for low-income households in the following 10 major cities: Memphis (13.2 percent of income), Birmingham (10.9 percent), Atlanta (10.2 percent), New Orleans (9.8 percent), Providence (9.5 percent), Pittsburgh (9.4 percent), Dallas (8.8 percent), Philadelphia (8.8 percent), Kansas City (8.5 percent), and Cleveland (8.5 percent).
For African-American households, the cities with the greatest energy burdens were: Memphis, Pittsburgh, New Orleans, Kansas City, Birmingham, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Atlanta.
Latino households experience the greatest energy burdens in: Memphis, Providence, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Atlanta, Birmingham, Phoenix, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Detroit.
If low-income housing stock were brought up to the efficiency level of the average US home, this would eliminate 35 percent of the average low-income energy burden of low-income households.  For African-American and Latino households, 42 percent and 68 percent of the excess energy burden, respectively, would be eliminated.
The five cities with the lowest median energy burdens for all households were San Francisco (1.4 percent), San Jose (1.8 percent), Seattle (2.1 percent), Washington, DC (2.1 percent), and San Diego (2.3 percent).
Ariel Drehobl, research analyst and lead report author, ACEEE, said: “We found that the overwhelming majority of low-income and households of color in major US cities experienced higher energy burdens when compared to the average household in the same city. Families who face higher energy burdens experience many negative long-term effects on their health and well-being. These families are at greater risk for respiratory diseases and increased stress, and they can experience increased economic hardship and difficulty in moving out of poverty.”
Jacqueline Patterson, director, Environmental and Climate Justice Program, NAACP, said: “For the communities we serve who are disproportionately plagued by pollution from energy production, for families who have to make choices between proper nutrition and keeping the lights on, and for unemployed persons for whom retrofitting and weatherization may provide a pathway out of poverty, this report illuminates the challenges and provides guidance on solutions that will result in healthier and more economically vibrant communities.”
Adrianna Quintero, executive director, Voces Verdes, said: “Increasing the energy efficiency of Latino households to the median level could cut their excess energy burdens by as much as a whopping 68 percent, putting more money in their pockets for things like food and, medical expenses.”
Khalil Shahyd, representative, Energy Efficiency for All coalition (which includes the Natural Resources Defense Council where he is a project manager of the Urban Solutions Program), said: “Increasing investments in energy efficiency can help improve energy affordability for all of America’s households, renters and owners alike, and this is especially critical for low-income renters whose energy burdens are more than three times higher. Cutting energy waste by improving energy efficiency leads to more comfortable homes; healthier, more prosperous communities; and is the quickest and most cost-effective way to reduce the dangerous carbon pollution fueling climate change.  Energy efficiency is a practical solution for climate change, one that all people can participate in directly and experience direct benefits from.”
Other key findings include the following:
The Southeast and Midwest regions had the highest average energy burdens across all groups.
Overall, low-income households experienced the highest median energy burden (7.2 percent), followed by African-American households (5.4 percent), low-income households living in multifamily buildings (5.0 percent), Latino households (4.1 percent), and renting households (4.0 percent).
In 17 cities — which is more than one-third of the cities studied — a quarter of low-income households experienced an energy burden greater than 14 percent, substantially higher than the 3.5 percent median for all households.
On average, African-American and white households paid similar utility bills, but African-American households experienced a median energy burden 64 percent greater than white households (5.4 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively). Latino households paid lower utility bills, on average, than African-American and white households did, yet they experienced a median energy burden 24 percent greater than white households (4.1 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively).
Renter households also experienced higher energy burdens (4.0 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively). Renters pay almost 20 percent more per square foot than home owners, indicating that they live in less efficient homes.
Experiencing high energy burdens can greatly affect the mental and physical health of families by increasing financial stress, cases of asthma, respiratory problems, heart disease, arthritis, and rheumatism. Children and the elderly are most susceptible to these health impacts caused by improperly heated or cooled homes.
Increasing investment in energy efficiency programs is an underutilized strategy that could compliment bill assistance and weatherization programs to help reduce high energy burdens in underserved communities. Suggested approaches include: targeting multifamily buildings with energy efficiency investments; using demographic data in program evaluation; and strengthening low-income targets and goals for utility programs.
States also could prioritize increasing energy efficiency programs in their plans to comply with the EPA’s Clean Power Plan to limit power plant emissions, and could opt in to the Clean Energy Incentive Program, which offers early credit for efficiency projects in low-income communities during the two years prior to the start of the compliance period.  
The full list of 48 US cities ranked in the report is as follows: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Fort Worth, Hartford, Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Louisville, Memphis, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, New York City, Oklahoma City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, Providence, Richmond, Riverside, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, St. Louis, Tampa, Virginia Beach, and Washington, DC.
The 15 cities found to have the worst energy burdens for low-income and minority households are (in alphabetical order): Atlanta, Birmingham, Cincinnati, Columbus, Dallas, Fort Worth, Hartford, Kansas City, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Providence, and St. Louis.

The report provides a snapshot of energy burdens in cities across the US. In the first half of the report, the focus is on an analysis of data from the US Census Bureau’s 2011 and 2013 American Housing Survey to determine energy burden values for 48 of the largest US cities and specific households within each city. Low-income households are defined as those with incomes at or below 80 percent of area median income. In the second half of the report, the authors reviewed strategies for alleviating high energy burdens, with a focus on policies and programs to increase the impact of energy efficiency initiatives in these communities.

Proposed RGGI raid puts Connecticut’s continued leadership in energy efficiency at risk;"Connecticut may be a small state, but in recent years it has become a big leader in energy efficiency. As one of only seven states with a formal goal of achieving all cost-effective energy efficiency, Connecticut has consistently ranked among the top ten in ACEEE’s annual State Energy Efficiency Scorecard.
The Constitution State has made a commitment to maximize energy efficiency as a way to help businesses and residents lower their energy bills, while also creating jobs and improving health, comfort, equity, and business productivity. However, a recent proposal from the state legislature may put these energy efficiency programs at risk.
Connecticut is one of nine states in the northeast that participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a voluntary program to reduce emissions in the region. States that participate in RGGI sell emission allowances through auctions, then invest the proceeds in programs to deliver clean energy and energy efficiency to customers. Connecticut has raised about $160 million through the RGGI program to date, funneling the majority of this funding into energy efficiency. These programs generate significant benefits while reducing customers’ energy bills. Energize Connecticut, a statewide program supported in part by RGGI proceeds, calculates that every dollar invested in energy efficiency in 2015 generated $2.80 in benefits. These programs keep dollars in customers’ pockets, and in the local economy by generating jobs in the clean energy industry. According to the state’s deputy commissioner for energy, RGGI funds support more than 10,000 jobs across Connecticut.
But with budget holes to fill, state legislators aren’t thinking about economic benefits. Instead, they’ve proposed to divert $22 million in RGGI funds into the state’s general fund. Not only would such a raid reduce the scale of energy efficiency programs offered to customers in the state, it would also chip away at Connecticut’s innovative financing program, the Connecticut Green Bank. Every dollar invested in the Connecticut Green Bank’s financing programs supports $10 of private-sector investment. These programs help low-income customers make energy-efficient upgrades in their homes and help towns and businesses invest in renewable energy.
Balancing a budget is not an easy task, to be sure, but raiding RGGI funds is not the solution.
Things are moving quickly in Connecticut, but there are glimmers of hope. Governor Dannel Malloy’s recently released budget proposal does not include the RGGI raid. And businesses and clean energy advocates are working to ensure the state legislature understands the value of the programs RGGI funding helps deliver. Connecticut has a long history of leadership when it comes to increasing energy efficiency, but short-sighted efforts to fill state coffers could have serious long-term implications for the businesses, workers, and residents who depend on these programs to keep energy affordable.

We’re tracking major US energy efficiency metrics on a new webpage. Check out how 2015 measures up.;"Ever wondered just how much energy we consume to power our economy? To keep our buildings working, machines humming, and wheels running? Are we really energy smart as a country?
ACEEE tracks a lot of data that could be used to help answer these questions. Today, we are unveiling a new web page that brings together many of these key numbers to demonstrate our country’s overall energy efficiency. We chose metrics that measure trends from the perspective of major energy users. The metrics can also serve as a gateway to investigate the nuances of energy efficiency across the economy.
Since efficiency is a relative concept, we can only describe a product or system as being more or less efficient than itself or another. We say that an LED bulb is more energy efficient than an incandescent bulb because it consumes less electricity to produce the same amount of light. In your home, you might find mobile phones, electric toothbrushes, hair dryers, heating and air conditioning units, cooking stoves, washing machines, and various electronic appliances. Each of these have their own measure of efficiency, just like the LED bulb.
Similarly, to understand the energy efficiency of say, the residential sector in the United States as a whole, we can measure the average energy consumed per household or per unit floor area. From year to year, this value may fluctuate for many reasons, such as changes in weather, the size of homes, the number of appliances in homes. Thus, when looking at an entire sector, it is not easy to isolate improvements in energy efficiency from other reasons we might use more or less energy.
We picked metrics covering residential and commercial buildings, state adoption of building codes, energy savings from appliance standards, industry energy intensity, combined heat and power (CHP) capacity, personal and freight transport energy intensity, and the use of public transit, to represent the efficiency of US buildings, industry, and transportation. We also included national- level indicators on energy productivity (gross domestic product per unit of energy use), public spending on energy efficiency, and savings from energy efficiency programs. The figure below shows that US energy productivity has been climbing steadily; that is, the US economy is becoming more efficient.
Data source: ACEEE analysis based on data in Monthly Energy Review, EIA. In 2015, the United States used less energy to produce more than in previous years.
We also tracked indicators on oil consumption, net imports, and energy-related emissions in the country. Overall, these metrics capture most of the energy use in the United States. Similar metrics illustrate and compare national energy efficiency profiles of other countries.
Almost all our data for the United States show improvement in 2015 over 2014. Energy productivity stepped up by 3.3% and per-capita energy use declined by 1.6%. Average energy efficiency in residential buildings improved by 4.3%, and in commercial buildings by almost 2%. However, we caution that some of these improvements may be due to milder than normal weather in 2015. Industry and transportation metrics also show progress. Industrial energy efficiency is continuing to improve in small steps. Millions more recorded trips are being taken by public transportation every year. Average fuel economy of new passenger vehicles and light trucks has improved by 1.6%. Annual net oil imports declined by 8.7%  and annual energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were lower by 2.5%.   
There are a few metrics for which we used projections or did not have the latest data. These metrics will be updated when new information becomes available. Trends from previous years still indicate that we are making modest progress in these areas. Savings from electricity programs improved by a significant 5.6% in 2014 over 2013, and the largest improvement was from natural gas efficiency programs, in which energy savings rose by 35% in 2014 over 2013.
To enable a smarter, cleaner, and less expensive energy system, the United States must continue to make progress on efficiency. In the face of increasing demand for energy services globally, governments, not just at the national level, but also at the regional and local levels, should take action to improve the energy efficiency of their economies. And focusing on energy efficiency starts with understanding where and how energy is used.

Replacing retiring power plants, is it a two-horse or three-horse race?;"There’s been a steady drumbeat of reports about coal and other power plant retirements in the face of low natural gas prices, aging plants, and new environmental regulations. As discussed in a recent ACEEE blog post, electricity use has been flat in recent years, although many forecasts continue to project modest growth (e.g., EIA projects electricity consumption to increase 0.8% per year). This roughly means that as old generating capacity is retired, it needs to be replaced by new generating capacity, plus, an allowance for modest load growth in some regions. The question is, what will replace this capacity? Many reports focus on natural gas and renewable energy, casting it as a race between these two “horses.” But since energy efficiency is generally less expensive than either of these options (click here for our most recent comparison), shouldn’t it be allowed to compete in the race?
When planners ignore the efficiency resource
Most recently, the American Public Power Association (APPA) released a report called America’s Electricity Generation Capacity 2016 Update, which estimates that over the 2008–2015 period, 90 Gigawatts (GW: a billion watts or 1000 megawatts) of power plants were retired, including 43 GW of coal. They project that an additional 45 GW will be retired by 2020, including 22 GW of coal. The APPA report finds that “natural gas, followed by wind, is the major source of new generation, though solar deployment continues to expand as well.” They express some concern about greater reliance on natural gas. The only time efficiency is mentioned in the report is in connection with higher efficiency power plants.
Similarly, in mid-March the Mid-Continent Independent System Operator (MISO – the entity that operates the electric grid in much of the Mississippi Valley) released its “Midterm Analysis of EPA’s Final Clean Power Plan.” They estimate that about 25% of the coal fleet in the MISO region will be retired by 2030, based on a variety of factors including states’ and utilities’ efforts to meet the Clean Power Plan targets. They also look to natural gas, wind, and solar to replace the retired capacity, including additional transmission capacity in order to move renewable power to population centers. Their analysis does not mention the word “efficiency” once.
Examples of planning done right
For both of these studies, there is a modest amount of energy efficiency in their base case. But energy efficiency can save a lot more than what is assumed in a business-as-usual baseline. For example, the graph below comes from the New England Independent System Operator (MISO’s “sister”) forecast, and shows the large role that energy efficiency is expected to play in New England. Similarly, the just-released Northwest Seventh Regional Power Plan expects to meet nearly all of their resource needs with energy efficiency as shown in another recent ACEEE blog post.

Capturing more than savings for customers
In ACEEE’s 2014 Change is in the Air report we estimate that just four energy efficiency policies (energy savings targets for utilities, building codes, combined heat and power systems and equipment efficiency standards) can, by 2020, avoid the need for 71 GW of new power plants. That is more than the 45 GW of retirements projected by APPA. Of course, power planning needs to be done on a localized level, and there will be some regions where additional generating capacity will be needed even with a lot more energy efficiency. Power planners, including MISO and APPA, need to more carefully examine what they can do to expand energy efficiency efforts, how much more can be saved, and at what cost. Work in New England, the Northwest, and at ACEEE indicates that expanding energy efficiency will reduce system costs, save consumers money, and also reduce the need for new gas and renewable energy plants.
The retirement of a large amount of generating capacity presents many regions with a golden opportunity to provide electric customers with a low-cost, emission-free resource: energy efficiency. Power planners need to open the barn door to give expanded energy efficiency efforts a chance to participate in a competitive horse race. If they do, we are confident that energy efficiency can win in a fashion that would give American Pharoah a run for his money.

Highlighting big savers in energy efficiency;"Electric energy efficiency programs have grown substantially in the last ten years. As they’ve grown, leaders have emerged. In our new report, Big Savers: Experiences and Recent History of Program Administrators Achieving High Levels of Energy Savings, we showcase 14 of these leaders. The report is not an exhaustive review of every leading utility or program administrator, nor is it a ranking system. Instead, we tell the story of these 14 through analysis of performance data and discussions with program managers.
The program administrators we reviewed represent many types, sizes, and geographic locations. We find big electricity savings coming from utilities big and small, rural and urban, regulated and deregulated, investor owned and municipal. One of the top performers we highlight is Otter Tail Power in Minnesota. This utility operates in a mostly rural, expansive service territory where the average community size is barely over 300 people. We also highlight bigger utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric in California, which serves over 5.3 million customers. We found big savers in the sunny Southwest (Tucson Electric Power in Arizona) and the snowy Northeast (Efficiency Vermont). The report demonstrates that leaders in saving electricity come in many shapes and sizes and are not limited to large utilities in high electricity-cost states, such as Massachusetts or California.
Savings are going up.  The cost of saving energy is not.  
Average savings for those in our study rose from 0.8% in 2007 to 1.8% in 2014 (as shown by the dotted green line in the figure below). During this period, spanning 107 total program years, program administrators achieved savings levels over 1.5% in 25 instances, over 2% in 10 instances, and over 3% in 1 instance. The data also show that high savings are sustainable over time. Of the 14 program administrators reviewed, 7 achieved savings levels higher than 1.5% in consecutive years. Three of the seven sustained that level of savings for more than four years.
Our review also documents several important trends related to the cost of saving energy. As the figure shows, average savings as a percentage of sales more than doubled from 0.8% to 1.8% while the average levelized cost of saved energy, the per kilowatt-hour cost of energy over the lifetime of a program, remains relatively stable around 3.5 cents per kWh. While the levelized cost of saved energy is not a benefit cost test or a cost effectiveness test (the report provides more information on those), it does provide a useful metric to compare various resource options for electric utilities. This finding is significant because it shows that even as savings increased from 2007 to 2014, the cost of savings has not.
Big savings are possible in regions with low electricity prices.    
A common concern we often hear in regions with a low cost of electricity is that achieving high levels of energy savings may not be cost effective. We find this is not the case. Of our 14 big savers, 8 operate in states with electricity prices below the national average. This clearly demonstrates that efficiency is cost effective and works in areas with low electricity prices. For example, Energy Trust of Oregon has offered some of the most successful energy efficiency programs for decades in an area served by low-cost hydro power. The program administrators in our study have also been able to increase savings while natural gas prices have continued to decline. Natural gas is the primary fuel for marginal energy production, which electricity efficiency programs help to displace. Even with the sharp decline in natural gas prices, energy efficiency has remained a cost effective resource.
Portfolios are evolving to continue high levels of savings.
Our report examines past program portfolios to understand how programs have evolved over time. Lighting, the primary share of savings for many program portfolios in the past, has experienced a reduced share in recent years. This trend is likely to continue and program administrators will need to innovate and evolve to continue sustaining high levels of savings. While some newer programs are becoming more prevalent, the program staff we interviewed reported they will continue to rely on traditional programs to achieve high levels of savings.
Ultimately, we find that while achieving big savings takes some creative thinking and the ability to adapt to changing regulatory environments and energy markets, program administrators of all types and sizes across the country have established that increasing and sustaining high levels of energy savings is possible. These leaders are committed to achieving high levels of savings in the years ahead, and their documented successes can serve as a blueprint for utilities looking to capture the benefits of energy efficiency.

Untangling the energy-use knot in cities;"“How much energy do cities use?” We get that question a lot. The answer is, excepting a few cities, we generally don’t know. Only a handful of cities publish their energy use, and while the Energy Information Administration collects and reports a lot of great data on state- and utility-level energy consumption, they do not report city-level data.
We are very interested in that question, though, and have been compiling city-level energy consumption data since 2013. So far, our dataset includes limited data for a sample of cities. Today, we are making it available on our State and Local Policy Database website.
The dataset contains total and per capita energy use data, including both community-wide and local government operations, for the buildings and transportation sectors in a selection of cities from the City Energy Efficiency Scorecard.
Our research
As part of our research for the 2013 and 2015 City Scorecards, we went looking for community-wide energy data because we were interested in scoring cities on aspects of their energy performance. We found problems with data availability, differences in reporting, and quality. Fewer than 15 of the 51 cities in the 2015 City Scorecard had public data on community-wide energy consumption for both buildings and transportation sectors. The same was true even for energy consumption in local government operations.
There isn’t a central database for local-level energy data. We collected most of the data from reports cities published themselves, often greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories that catalog emissions levels. In some cases, we found cities’ energy data in the CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) Cities Database.
Data limitations
Because we collected data from greenhouse gas inventories, each with its own specific scope, quality, and level of transparency, there are several data limitations. Cities report their energy consumption using different units across similar sectors. For example, some jurisdictions report on-road vehicle energy consumption in vehicle miles traveled (VMT), while others report it in gallons of diesel and gasoline consumed. And simply pulling together all the cities that use VMT as a metric is not enough. There are several acceptable ways to calculate VMT, and depending on a city’s needs, it may select one or a combination thereof (more on the methods for calculating VMT in Chapter 7 here). Cities also differ from one another in the sectors they choose to track. We did our best to control for this by only including sectors for which energy use was most widely reported (which turned out to be buildings and transportation). And that’s not to mention any issues arising from inaccuracies with the underlying data (which we could not verify) or the general quality of the inventory.
These limitations mean there’s most certainly noise in the data. Therefore, we discourage direct comparisons of one city to another, especially for energy consumption trends. It’s best to compare a city’s energy levels against its own baseline, as we began to explore in Chapter 7 of our 2015 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard.
Next Steps
Why release the data, then, given all the limitations? In efforts to encourage transparency around energy data, you need to start somewhere. The data could be vital to community-wide planning processes. For example, local governments could focus their efforts on the most energy intensive aspects of their economies, and eventually begin to examine the impact of policies on energy performance. If cities begin using a standardized method for reporting consumption in the future, it would be easier for them to compare their energy use to peers.
This dataset will reside on the city pages of our State and Local Policy Database. We encourage local governments to review it, and provide updates, corrections, and clarifications. If you have any, please contact me at dribeiro@aceee.org. If your city tracks this kind of data and you’d like it to be included, please also contact me.
We aim to update the dataset quarterly, but we will also ask for updates as we collect data for the City Scorecard. If the quality and quantity of data improves, we may be able to include more performance-based metrics in the report.
We are optimistic that more cities will move toward tracking and reporting energy use data. A recent flurry of activity related to data access gives reason to be hopeful. The Better Buildings Energy Data Accelerator worked to improve access to whole-building energy use data by bringing utilities and local governments together. We are seeing cities adopting and implementing benchmarking and transparency policies, including Atlanta and Kansas City. The Center for Neighborhood Technology’s Housing and Transportation Affordability Index is bringing more visibility to energy in the transportation sector with data on vehicle miles traveled and transit use. And the Georgetown Energy Prize’s Competition Dashboard reports electricity and natural gas savings for cities and counties participating in their competition. Hopefully these efforts will move the needle steadily in the right direction.

US electricity use is no longer growing;"For many years, electricity use in the United States increased steadily, in lock-step with growth in the economy as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). But since 2010, electricity consumption has been essentially flat, even as GDP has risen steadily. The earlier trend and the divergence are shown in the graph below. New figures just released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) show that electricity use in 2015 was nearly identical to use in 2010, even as the economy grew 11%.
Many analysts, including EIA and ACEEE, are attributing the change in part to energy efficiency, including federal and state product efficiency standards, state and local building codes, and efficiency programs operated by utilities and others. Annual differences in weather and changes in the structure of the economy (e.g., more services, less heavy manufacturing) probably also play a role. Also, it should be noted that there are regional differences. In recent years, electricity use has generally declined a little in the Northeast and grown somewhat in the South; other regions have tended to be stable.
US electricity consumption and GDP over a 20-year period

While crystal balls are murky, there is a good chance this trend will continue as many factors are driving use down and only a few factors are driving it up. Factors pushing use down include continued energy efficiency efforts, continued changes in the economy, reduced space heating use due to gradually warming weather and southward population shifts, and likely continued growth in solar and other distributed generation (the graph only includes power used and sold by utilities). Factors that could drive electricity use up include growth in electric vehicles, rising air conditioning use due to warmer weather and southward population shifts, and installation of air conditioning in more northern homes.
Flat electricity growth has important implications for utility system planning. It means that new generation is only needed to replace retiring plants or to replace existing but more expensive plants, allowing the more expensive plants to operate less or even retire. It also means that utility revenues increase only to the extent that rates go up or utilities identify new value-added services to sell. The days when utilities can expect to grow by increasing sales may be over.

For low-cost savings that benefit ratepayers and the planet alike, utilities embrace efficiency;"Much like the proverbial ‘juice’ by which it’s often referred, electricity can go a long way for those who make a habit of squeezing every last drop of what they have. When everyone adopts this mindset, we all win, freeing up resources to dedicate to other critical needs. That’s the commonsense approach the utility sector has increasingly recognized and embraced over the years, harnessing efficiency to avoid or defer costs such as developing new energy supplies, building transmission infrastructure, and complying with environmental rules.
Spending data from the past 20 years illustrates just how much this trend has caught on among the utility sector. Total spending for customer-funded electric efficiency programs and natural gas programs together amounted to more than $7 billion in 2014, more than five times what was invested in efficiency programs just a decade ago. Clearly utilities see the benefit of smart investments in energy efficiency. But it wasn’t always this way.
Annual electric and natural gas energy efficiency program spending
Note: natural gas spending is not available for the years 1993–2004. Sources: ACEEE Nadel, Kubo, and Geller 2000; York and Kushler 2002, 2005; Eldridge et al. 2007, 2008, 2009; Gilleo et al. 2015; CEE 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015.
Up until the mid-1990s, rigid utility business models that depended on selling more electricity each year created relatively weak incentives for cutting waste. However, as states restructured utilities, began implementing public benefits charges, and investigated ways to align the utility business model with the delivery of energy savings to customers, energy efficiency efforts ramped up. More recently, numerous states have adopted energy savings goals that have further spurred investment in efficiency.
Current trends in spending and the regulatory landscape point to an increasingly bright future for energy efficiency and its role as a utility resource. Utilities across the country, from Arkansas to Arizona to Maine, are implementing efficiency programs. And every dollar they spend on efficiency ultimately pays off, helping advance cutting-edge technologies, reducing pollution in our skies, and lowering utility bills for customers.

Looking for small business energy efficiency program data, designs, strategies, and more;"There are over 25 million small enterprises that form the backbone of our national economy. They are critical to the health of local economies, generating well over half of net new private-sector jobs, according to the US Small Business Administration. Many are home-based firms with few employees, but many also occupy commercial retail space. The small business sector uses over 30% of all commercial space, more than 20 billion square feet of buildings to be heated, cooled, and lit up.
But of these millions of small commercial utility customers, only a small fraction participates in energy efficiency programs due to persistent barriers such as costs, lack of awareness or information, and time. Imagine that you’re running your own independent restaurant. Maybe you’re interested in installing energy-efficient lighting. But to do so, you need to find time in your schedule, capital to invest, and education on the best lighting solutions for your business—so the lighting project may not become a top priority or happen at all. 
ACEEE research reports on exemplary programs, high program participation, and next generation programs, among others, have documented successful small business energy efficiency approaches, but how can these be expanded and replicated to serve more small business customers? More important, what are the new and emerging technologies, program designs, and marketing strategies to expand existing small business energy efficiency programs and create new ones? We aim to find out. 
Are you a small business energy efficiency program manager with successes or a pilot project to share? A program implementation contractor disrupting the market or inventing a new category? Contact me (snowak@aceee.org) to add your story to ACEEE’s new research on small business programs. We are looking for energy-efficient technologies, program designs, marketing strategies, and performance data on small business energy efficiency programs.

New studies are showing what we already know: energy efficiency keeps electricity affordable and reduces environmental compliances costs;"Multiple studies looking at spending and savings across programs, over time and in multiple states, all show the same thing: energy efficiency is highly cost effective. Put another way, it keeps electricity affordable by meeting demand and environmental regulations at a lower cost than if we generated new power, including from clean energy resources. To help break down this discussion to key points, we released two new fact sheets today, one showing that energy efficiency is consistently the lowest-cost option for meeting electric demand and the other showing that including energy efficiency can lower the cost of Clean Power Plan compliance.
“How Much Does Energy Efficiency Cost?” includes results from studies by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, ACEEE, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The fact sheet shows how these studies provide further evidence that energy efficiency costs less than other sources of energy, and also that the costs of energy efficiency have been level in recent years. “Energy Efficiency Lowers the Cost of Clean Power Plan Compliance” looks at the results of three studies, all finding that including energy efficiency as part of state compliance plans will lower costs to utility customers.  For example, a study by Synapse Resource Economics provides state-by-state information on most of the states.
This is great news for the people tasked with maintaining affordable electricity. So why isn’t it the go-to plan in more states? There are existing market barriers, such as the fact that utilities generally make more money by selling more power. Also, there aren’t a lot of deep pockets advocating for large-scale efficiency. And, the potential and cost of tapping into large-scale energy efficiency savings seems to be poorly understood by some. The state planning process around the Clean Power Plan (CPP) is a perfect example of this. Energy efficiency can help states achieve most of their 2030 CPP emissions targets while reducing electricity bills. This image from one of the fact sheets released today shows how adoption of a few common energy efficiency policies can help states achieve CPP compliance while reducing the costs of meeting electric demand.
Impact of using energy efficiency for Clean Power Plan compliance in select states
Source: analysis using ACEEE SUPR2 model.
The fact sheet goes on to explain that multiple analyses have found that using energy efficiency for CPP compliance will reduce electricity bills for everyone. One study finds that an energy efficiency scenario reduced electric bills by 17%. Another study shows that in most states using energy efficiency for compliance with the CPP will reduce bills by more than $10 per month.
A long time ago, we developed a regulatory system for electricity. But times have changed. Technological advances and decades of experience have unveiled a new path forward. By using energy efficiency, we can ensure that electricity is affordable and reliable while protecting public health and preserving our natural resources for future generations. Hopefully more states will recognize how energy efficiency can lower costs and embrace policies to spur electric energy savings. But some state regulators may continue playing by the old rules, and their citizens will have higher bills as a result.

New Behavior Program manager, looking for data;"You know the facial expression of a person who got confused on the way to being excited? That is the typical the response I get when I tell people my areas of research. I am an environmental psychologist. Before you ask… No, I do not perform psychotherapy on bunnies and I’m afraid I can’t tell you how trees feel before being cut down (although I imagine it’s the type of thing that would get your sap pumping). In fact, I have spent the better part of a decade (in British Columbia, Canada) researching the psychology of human behavior, as it relates to environmental problems. How do people perceive climate change? What motivates human behavior to reduce pollution? How can we encourage energy efficiency through behavior change? These are the questions that drive my work.
My environmental psychology publications span a broad spectrum of topics from changing behavior by social modeling (in the community and on campus), to the effectiveness of simple visual prompts, to the role of personal values in commons dilemmas. I’ve also examined the psychology of climate change, pro-environmental attitudes, and the design of sustainable cities that meet residents’ psychological needs. The common thread tying all of my research interests together has always been the application of psychology to real-world problems. At ACEEE I will examine human behavior from a variety of psychological and non-psychological perspectives in order to assess opportunities for improved energy efficiency.
I am writing today not only to introduce myself, but also to ask for your assistance. My first project at ACEEE is a review of the status and impact of behavior change programs designed to reduce energy consumption. This will be an update of the ACEEE Field Guide to Utility-Run Behavior Programs and will focus specifically on programs run by utilities, researchers, governments, and others that have been evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing energy consumption. If you know of any such programs or have information about a program that you have run, please email me at rsussman@aceee.org. I’m eager to hear about the programs (big or small) that I may not otherwise know about.
My other responsibility at ACEEE is co-chairing the Behavior, Energy & Climate Change Conference (BECC). This is a well-attended and important event in the world of behavior change and global warming. It is unique in that it brings together researchers and decision makers in order to help inform critical climate change policies. If this is a topic that interests you, I suggest submitting an abstract soon. The deadline for abstract submissions is April 8, 2016 for the conference, which happens on October 20-22, 2016.
Although the psychology of behavior change is my area of expertise, I look forward to continued learning and growth as research manager of behavior and human dimensions of energy efficiency at ACEEE. Please feel free to contact me to introduce yourself, or ask questions about intersection of behavior, psychology, and energy efficiency.

Electricity savings from coast to coast;"We tend to talk about energy savings in two ways. There is the total annual impact of savings, made up of layers of savings from programs implemented in the past but still saving energy today, and there are incremental savings, or savings attributed to new programs implemented in a given year. At ACEEE, we track incremental savings within our State Energy Efficiency Scorecard. These data points put states on an even playing field, recognizing what a state has achieved in a given year regardless of what it has done in the past.
Source: Data from ACEEE’s 2015 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard
In 2014, we saw incremental electricity savings continue to rise – up nearly 6% from the year before. And these savings aren’t just coming from long-regarded leaders in energy efficiency like California and Massachusetts. Utilities and program administrators in states all across the country achieved electricity savings in 2014.
In the northeast, Rhode Island achieved record-breaking electricity savings of over 3.5% in 2014. Another fifteen states achieved savings of over 1%. We also saw states with emerging efficiency programs make steady progress. Arkansas, which established energy efficiency goals in 2010, achieved savings of more than 0.5%—four times the electricity saved in the state just two years earlier.
These savings are driven by well-crafted policies encouraging energy savings, business models that reward utility investment in efficiency, and strong support from policymakers, regulators, businesses, and residents. As more states put these durable policies in place, we expect that electricity savings will continue to rise in the future.

Introducing an ACEEE webinar series on energy efficiency and the Clean Power Plan;"Energy efficiency is a proven and cost-effective strategy to reduce pollution and can help states comply with environmental regulations, including EPA’s Clean Power Plan. Even with the Supreme Court stay of the rule, there are many reasons to move forward with energy efficiency. To explore the opportunity for energy efficiency to be used for Clean Power Plan compliance, we are introducing a new webinar series, “Energy Efficiency and the Clean Power Plan.” Each webinar will highlight ACEEE’s latest research, emphasizing best practices in program and policy design. These webinars will feature presentations from our Clean Power Plan experts Sara Hayes and me. We will be joined by ACEEE staff for the following webinars:

Sharing the human face of energy efficiency;"As energy efficiency geeks, we here at ACEEE are deep into the numbers, publishing report after report on the quads and TWh and MMT CO2 savings from efficiency. We know these numbers and units represent major benefits for the nation, but sometimes we find it hard to explain—to policymakers, advocates outside of the energy world, and even our own families—what they mean for individual American families. We’re trying to change that.
Meet Melissa Ruiz of Philadelphia. Her daughter has asthma and was a regular at the local emergency room until the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative worked with city agencies to seal the air leaks in her home, fix the plumbing leaks, insulate the basement and make other repairs. The single mom’s utility bills have gone down, but more importantly, her daughter can breathe again.
In order to tell more stories like this, we are releasing three fact sheets today—one on families, one on jobs, and one on health and the environment—that talk about how energy efficiency benefits people like Melissa and her family. Together with an earlier piece on what energy efficiency is, they are intended to convey for broad audiences why people should care about efficiency.                             
The first shows how “Saving Energy Helps American Families.” Teri and John Norsworthy of Summerton, South Carolina saved money on their utility bills with help from their local rural electric cooperative. Using low-interest loans, the Norswothys were able to make home improvements that cut their electric bills as much as $200 a month, which helped them budget their fixed income. Our fact sheet also talks about how smart homes and better information give families more choice and more control over how they use energy, which we have found is important to many consumers.
The second shows how “Saving Energy Helps American Businesses and Creates Jobs.” Energy efficiency helps businesses, both by making them more lean and competitive, and by providing investment opportunities. Those opportunities in turn create jobs. The Department of Energy’s Industrial Assessment Centers provide a lot of good examples, including the Boral Bricks factory in Muskogee, Oklahoma. An Oklahoma State University team identified $79,000 in efficiency investments that saved them $63,000 a year. Go Cowboys! And, if you grumble at the gas pump, new truck standards are reducing the $75,000 in diesel fuel used by the average long-haul truck each year.
The third fact sheet discusses how “Saving Energy Improves Americans’ Health and the Environment.” Energy efficiency clears the air of pollution, which means better health for people (and pets and plants). Burning fuels causes not only asthma, like that of Melissa Ruiz’s daughter, but also lung cancer, heart attacks, and stroke. All of these conditions are reduced by increasing energy efficiency. And designing communities to give residents the choice to walk and ride bikes can reduce obesity as well as traffic.
As analysts, we could not entirely give up the broader statistics, like the cool $1 trillion that McKinsey & Co. found efficiency could save nationwide. But our focus here is on concrete benefits energy efficiency provides for real people.
We know there are many more stories out there. If you have a good story or example of how energy efficiency has helped specific people, please contact us or share it in the comment section below.

How much is a trillion anyway?;"With cumulative dollar savings from products sold through 2035 estimated at over one trillion, appliance, equipment, and lighting efficiency standards are making a huge impact nationally. The savings are of such a magnitude that most of us can barely grasp how large they are.
A trillion dollars is a LOT of money.
With one trillion dollars, you could give every person in the US $3000 and still have some left over.
If you’d spent one million dollars a day since the year 1, you wouldn’t have reached a trillion dollars yet (you wouldn’t even reach it until sometime in the 2700s).
Appliance standards accomplish trillion-dollar savings by assuring a minimum level of energy and water efficiency for household and commercial appliances, resulting in energy savings for consumers and businesses. Once a national standard goes into effect, for clothes washers for example, it applies to every clothes washer sold or imported into the United States. Standards spread the “energy-saving” wealth around.
The energy savings are equally as impressive. The graph below shows annual electricity and natural gas savings from appliance standards. The 2012 The Efficiency Boom report, published by ACEEE and the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), estimated that electricity savings from standards represented 7% of US annual electricity use in 2010. By 2014—just 4 years later—the savings had grown to 12% of annual electricity use. The 2014 savings also amounted to 4% of end-use natural gas consumption. Savings grow as new appliance standards take effect and as older appliances and equipment are replaced with more-efficient ones. Standards for central air conditioners and several types of lighting account for most of the increase.
Savings of national appliance, equipment, and lighting standards by year.
Source: Appliance Standards Awareness Project (unpublished update of an analysis in Lowenberger et al. 2012).
And what about the products themselves? The 2013 ACEEE/ASAP Better Appliances report analyzes how choices available to consumers have changed over time as efficiency standards have taken effect. As products have become more efficient, the report finds that performance has generally stayed the same or improved and new features have been offered to consumers (e.g., through-the-door ice on refrigerators, steam cycles on washers, longer lifetime for lighting). In the majority of cases analyzed, the price of the product either stayed the same or declined. In the few cases where the price was higher, the price increases were outweighed by electricity bill savings.
The power of appliance standards: not only trillion-dollar savings, but less wasted energy, more-efficient appliances and better variety. Not a bad outcome!

How to build a better low-income energy efficiency program;"Many people groan when they see their utility bill spike after a cold February, but for some it is more than just an annoyance. Imagine if you had to under-heat your home during that cold February because you knew you wouldn’t be able to afford the utility bill. Imagine if you didn’t realize how much it would cost to heat your home to a comfortable temperature, and are now stuck with a bill larger than you can afford. By one estimate, 44% of low-income households struggle to meet basic heating, cooling, and other energy needs. That amounts to 16 million households in the United States.
Building better programs
Part of the problem is that low-income households tend to have higher-than-average energy demand because of older and less-efficient appliances and equipment. While energy efficiency programs around the country have helped to address inefficiencies in low-income housing for years, our recent research finds there is room for growth. ACEEE’s new report Building Better Programs for Low-Income Households details opportunities for scaling up program activity and increasing savings from programs reaching the people who need it most. In the report, we discuss best practices from existing programs for overcoming many of the key challenges that program administrators face, including how to address housing deficiencies that prevent energy efficiency upgrades, how to address cost effectiveness challenges, and how to serve hard-to-reach households.
We also explore opportunities for increasing program activity around high efficiency products and equipment, measures we found to be under-utilized in the low-income sector. In the residential sector, by comparison, a majority of electric energy efficiency program savings result from product rebate programs. These programs tend to have the lowest cost of saved energy. While low-income customers are eligible to participate in conventional product rebate programs, data suggest they are less likely to take advantage of these programs than other customers. Appliance, electronic, and equipment programs designed to address the specific needs of low-income customers can expand participation, increase savings, and help utilities achieve these savings at a lower cost.
Opportunities in the Clean Power Plan
There is also opportunity to expand low-income energy efficiency programs as a part of the Clean Power Plan, which sets limits on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. The Clean Power Plan includes a Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP), which provides incentives for early investment in energy efficiency in low-income communities. States and utilities with existing low-income energy efficiency programs can leverage them to scale up assistance for low-income households. Utilities and states with less established programs in the low-income sector can use the Clean Power Plan and the CEIP to meet emissions reductions goals while also addressing the energy needs of low-income customers.
Even though the Supreme Court has issued a stay on the Clean Power Plan rule until legal challenges are heard, many state regulators are moving forward with plans. This report can serve as a guide for developing new low-income programs as well as scaling up existing activity to contribute to emissions reduction targets.
We hope an increased focus on delivering energy efficiency improvements to low-income customers will give more families a fair shot to participate in the efficiency programs that all utility customers help fund.

The long road to today's CAFE standards;"Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and light trucks, first adopted in 1975 in the wake of the OPEC oil embargo, resulted in a doubling of average new vehicle fuel economy a decade later. Following that period of rapid advance were two decades of stagnant fuel economy standards. In fact, because cars and light trucks were subject to different standards, and light trucks’ share of the market grew—largely reflecting the rise of the sport utility vehicle—there was a slight but steady decline in average fuel economy for cars and light trucks combined from 1990 to 2004, as shown in the figure below. (How those standards played out in real world fuel economy and other vehicle characteristics is discussed in an earlier post.) During the Clinton administration, Congress imposed a rider on the Department of Transportation appropriations bill for FY 1996 through 2001 prohibiting the use of funds to “prepare, propose, or promulgate” new fuel economy standards.
The George W. Bush administration modestly increased standards for light trucks beginning in 2005. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) accelerated the upswing in fuel economy by requiring that federal standards be set to achieve at least 35 miles per gallon on average by 2020. Also in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Mass v. EPA that the EPA had the authority, and indeed the obligation, to regulate greenhouse gas emissions—which, for motor vehicles, are closely related to fuel economy—under the Clean Air Act. By that time, California had already adopted GHG emissions standards for vehicles, which were to take effect in 2009. The Obama administration leveraged these circumstances, together with federal support for the automakers in crisis, to go well beyond EISA requirements and adopt joint CAFE and GHG emissions standards that were projected to achieve an average fuel economy of about 49 miles per gallon in model year 2025. Standards for future years are represented as dotted lines in the figure.
Data sources: NHTSA, Summary of Fuel Economy Performance (Public Version) Dec. 15, 2014; Fed. Reg. 75 No.88, May 7 2010; Fed. Reg. 77 No.199, October 15 2012. Miles per gallon values throughout this post are the laboratory test values used for fuel economy certification purposes. Label, or “real-world,” values are approximately 20% lower on average.
Standards set pursuant to EISA vary with vehicle size; smaller vehicles have higher fuel economy targets than larger vehicles do. This structural change in the CAFE program was intended to ensure that the standards would promote the adoption of efficiency technologies rather than the production of smaller vehicles. But it also means that average fuel economy for new vehicles in a given year will depend not only upon the car/light truck split, as it did in the 80s and 90s, but also on the size mix of vehicles of each type. If vehicles purchased are larger than anticipated when the standards were adopted, the average fuel economy required in future years will fall short of the projected values, and GHG emissions from the US vehicle fleet will exceed the levels anticipated.

A brief history of CHP development in the United States;"Combined heat and power (CHP) systems, also known as cogeneration, generate electricity and useful thermal energy in a single, integrated system. Heat that is normally wasted in conventional power generation is recovered as useful energy, which avoids the losses that would otherwise occur from separate generation of heat and power. While the conventional method of producing usable heat and power separately has a typical combined efficiency of 45 percent, CHP systems can operate at efficiencies of 60–80 percent or more.
The CHP concept was first applied in 1882 at Thomas Edison’s Pearl Street Station, the first central power plant in the United States. The plant provided electricity and steam to a section of downtown New York. But, as the electric era emerged in the 20th century, and power plants moved away from cities to rural areas, uses for the excess heat became limited and CHP fell out of favor.
The passage of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) ushered in the modern CHP era. This law included a provision that legalized the sale of non-utility-generated electricity to the grid, which helped increase the use of CHP. While some large industrial facilities generated electricity prior to PURPA, its passage more than doubled CHP capacity by the early 1990s (see figure). The prospects for CHP were further advanced by provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the combined effects of both policies resulted in a quadrupling of CHP capacity by the early 2000s.
CHP capacity in the United States by sector
Source: ACEEE analysis from ICF data
The uncertainty created by natural gas price volatility beginning in the early 2000s, combined with the recessions of 2001 and 2007–2009, largely stalled additions to CHP capacity in the industrial sector. Despite these factors, CHP capacity in the institutional and commercial sector continued to grow during this time period. This is likely due in part to the financing capabilities of institutional entities, like universities and hospitals. Institutions often accept longer investment horizons than the business sector, helping maintain a steady increase in new CHP capacity in the sector.
With the economic recovery and relatively low natural gas prices, we have seen interest in CHP returning, particularly where the added benefit of electric reliability is valued. Another trend expected to encourage CHP in future years is increased demand for emissions reductions, especially with EPA’s Clean Power Plan and the commitment to reduce greenhouse gases under the Paris agreement.

Here’s a how-to guide to help states cut their emissions with energy efficiency;"As inhabitants of the Information Age, we have the power to do whatever we put our minds to. Want to learn to tie a tie? There are tutorials on YouTube. Thinking of baking macaroons? Look it up on Pinterest. Want to learn a new language? There's an app for that. No matter what task you are tackling, there is likely an online guide to help you ""do it yourself."" While we might not be able to help you assemble IKEA furniture or truss a chicken, ACEEE can help you develop a strategy for complying with the Clean Power Plan while avoiding energy waste.
ACEEE’s new white paper series is our ""how-to"" guide for states as they embark upon the path to meeting their Clean Power Plan emission reduction targets. Even with the recent Supreme Court stay, we think there are plenty of reasons to continue to plan for the future.
Energy efficiency has long been recognized as a tool for creating jobs and keeping electricity affordable, and it is increasingly being seen as a strategy for reducing pollution. Through the Clean Power Plan, EPA requires states to reduce their carbon pollution and encourages them to use energy efficiency to do so.
In the first paper of the series, we highlight the steps states can take to use energy efficiency as a key compliance pathway. We describe the WHO (important stakeholder groups), the WHAT (factors to consider in evaluating EE options), and the WHY (critical decisions and their implications for EE). The good news is that states need not start from scratch and can build on existing energy efficiency programs as part of their compliance plans. We explain how to gather all the right tools needed to develop a lowest-cost compliance plan.  
In the subsequent papers in this series we describe the ingredients needed to whip up particular plan components starting with ""Lead By Example"" (LBE) initiatives. When it comes to saving energy and reducing emissions, state and local governments can do it themselves through energy savings targets for public buildings or energy savings performance contracts. This guide highlights tried-and-true best practices in designing, implementing, and expanding LBE programs—with specific examples sprinkled throughout.
While the steps for saving energy and reducing pollution are different from culinary ""how-to's,"" our twenty-first century do-it-yourself attitude is transferable. Use energy efficiency in any Clean Power Plan compliance scenario? You can do that. Reliably track energy savings from energy efficiency programs? You already do that. In forthcoming best practice pieces, ACEEE will explore other energy efficiency opportunities, including those in low-income communities.

Why we need innovations AND insulation;"Bill Gates, billionaire philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, marked several items off his 2015 to-do list when he announced the creation of two coalitions (one of international governments, the other of billionaire investors) for investing money in developing renewable energy innovations, while pledging one billion dollars of his own money to the effort.
In an interview last November with The Atlantic called “We Need an Energy Miracle,” Gates stressed the importance of investing in energy research and development, with a goal of expediting the development of breakthrough renewable technologies to combat climate change. His renewables-over-efficiency line of thinking can be traced back to his 2010 blog post, “Why We Need innovation, Not Just Insulation,” where he advocates focusing on renewables rather than efficiency to reach an 80% CO2 reduction by 2050.
While we applaud Gates’s championing of innovation in the energy industry, we disagree with his method of delivery, which paints energy efficiency and renewable energy as competing forces, rather than as the twin pillars of sustainable energy to be used together to reduce conventional energy consumption.
Gates’s contributions to the energy industry are welcome, and have the potential to make a sizable positive impact. But, with a growing number of individuals like him entering the energy technology arena in search of a renewable energy “silver bullet,” it is important to step back and reflect on the progress already made with energy efficiency, and renewable energy’s interdependent partnership with energy efficiency.
Energy efficiency as a stand-alone tool
By itself, energy efficiency has provided a number of benefits to the United States. From 1980 to 2014, US energy intensity dropped from 12.1 thousand Btus per dollar to 6.1, a 50% improvement, of which a conservatively estimated 60% can be attributed to energy efficiency. Overall, energy efficiency savings in 2014 totaled roughly 58 quadrillion Btus, saving about $800 billion. Not only does energy efficiency save energy and money, but it creates jobs, grows the economy, increases our nation’s security, and reduces harmful emissions of fuel combustion by-products. Within buildings, energy efficiency measures increase tenant comfort and satisfaction, which results in lower turnover rates, and in turn, increases property value.
Energy efficiency has been proven to be cheaper than making energy, and will continue to provide value for the foreseeable future as our energy consumption habits continue to grow. ACEEE estimates there is an opportunity for energy efficiency to reduce current energy use by 40 to 60% by 2050, and other organizations, such as the Rocky Mountain Institute, have estimated similar possible savings.
Synergies between energy efficiency and renewable energy
Efficiency can be viewed as renewable energy’s silent partner, enabling renewable energy technologies to scale as the market for renewables continues to develop. Skeptics may speculate that the coexistence of efficiency and renewables will inevitably cause conflict; however, in practice energy efficiency serves a complementary role to renewable energy.
For example, a case study by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and the Building America Program estimated that a larger proportion of zero net energy homes’ energy was reduced through energy efficiency (35%) than was generated through solar PV renewable energy systems (25%). By first using energy efficiency (which is the cheapest utility resource) to minimize energy consumption, the remaining energy needs of the home can then be met through renewable energy systems. We will have a difficult time reaching our energy goals if we fail to recognize this cooperative relationship between energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Final thoughts
Bill Gates’s advocacy for renewable energy over energy efficiency comes from a genuine concern about climate change, and undoubtedly his actions will raise awareness of energy issues, and potentially even accelerate energy innovations. We would urge him to be mindful not to minimize the importance of energy efficiency as he advocates for a cleaner energy future. Energy efficiency has provided a variety of benefits to the US economy and population for years, and will continue to provide value as both a complement to renewable energy and a stand-alone resource.

Meet the $100 billion market of energy efficiency financing;"As the stock market soared to new heights after the Great Recession, so too did energy efficiency financing. Our new paper, Energy Efficiency Finance: A Market Reassessment provides an overview of structures that are working in the energy efficiency finance industry today, which markets still remain elusive, and what opportunities the future may hold.
Energy efficiency financing has come a long way in the last few years. In a 2011 paper, ACEEE cataloged a burgeoning industry still trying to find its feet in the wake of financial collapse. That paper introduced the types of institutions, structures, and prominent players in a growing and changing industry and outlined impediments to future growth.
Five years later, there are still underserved markets, but many more instances of success and scale. Multiple sectors of the industry, such as green and efficient buildings, hybrid and electric cars, ENERGY STAR®- certified IT equipment, and the energy service company (ESCO) industry have matured into multi-billion dollar segments.
Successful financing mechanisms share a number of similarities: these areas build upon financing products with well-established ties to the larger capital markets, the lending is well integrated into the program designs and provides critical support for the sales process, and the financing programs often provide ancillary benefits outside of just offering capital.
All of this adds up to an estimated $100 billion of annual loan originations in the United States alone.
While there is a lot to celebrate, there remains room for improvement. Solving the question of how to best serve low-income and multifamily housing markets has been a vexing challenge for the financial services market for decades, so it may be of little surprise that these segments still face significant hurdles in securing financing for energy efficiency investments. Financing in this area has been limited by concerns about borrowers’ ability to repay loans and collateral values if they should default, but several pilots have shown great promise, albeit at a modest scale.
The small-commercial market is another area where promise surpasses current lending activity. New models, such as one-stop shops that help guide small business owners through the numerous financing options available, offer great hope. Other options, such as commercial PACE, could be more effective with the right nudge.
While challenges exist for some areas, so do new tools. Green bonds, now a $30 billion market, offer new methods of reaching investors, particularly through pensions, which have largely been untapped by the efficiency finance market. In the nation’s capital, demand for DC Water’s inaugural green bond was so high it was able to get better terms and extend the maturities to better match the useful life of the investments—in this case, to 100 years.
If energy efficiency finance can build on the momentum of past success and continue to innovate, who knows how much more money will be invested or, more importantly, saved.

Take a ride on the energy slide with building codes;"Building codes have protected people with minimum health and safety requirements for buildings since the Code of Hammurabi in 1754 BCE. Energy provisions in US codes have protected owners and tenants from excessive energy waste since the 1970s. They set minimum performance levels for energy features in new buildings and renovations, notably insulation, windows, air sealing, and to some extent, lighting and heating and cooling equipment.
Most building energy codes in this country are set by states, based on model codes developed by independent organizations. For homes, this is usually the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), developed by an organization of code officials called the International Code Council. For commercial buildings, the federal government recognizes ASHRAE Standard 90.1, developed by a professional society of engineers. The code development process is complex. After some early progress, energy codes languished through most of the 1990s.
However, in the last decade energy savings in the model codes have been so dramatic that the lines in the graph look like cliffs, or at least water slides. These advances were spurred by savings goals adopted by ASHRAE, the Department of Energy (under President Bush), and outside groups, in part due to concerns about climate change. The rapid progress was enabled by better technologies and building methods that allow cost-effective savings, such as tighter building shells, improved insulation, low-e windows, and new kinds of lighting.
Relative Energy Use under Model Building Energy Codes 1980-2015
Source: ACEEE based on analysis from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
The graph shows the energy use of a home or building that just meets the respective codes, averaged across building types and regions, compared to a similar home or building from the 1970s. Energy use estimates are based on building simulations and analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. For commercial buildings the graph includes all energy use. But for homes it just includes energy use affected by the code, mostly for heating and cooling; the percentage change in total home energy use would be smaller than that shown. Between 2008 and 2012, energy use covered under the residential model code dropped 32%. Between 2003 and 2013, total energy use for a building that meets the commercial model code dropped 37%.
Even though codes in many states are far behind the national models, the effect of codes has been dramatic. Average energy use per household has gone down even as houses have gotten bigger and the use of air conditioning and electronics has shot up. We estimate the most recent codes, if implemented nationwide, would save about $150 billion (net present value after needed investments), reduce total energy use in buildings nationwide by 5% in 2030, and create tens of thousands of jobs. We just need states to jump on the slide.
For more on the potential for building energy codes to transform energy use, see the ACEEE report Energy Codes for Ultra-Low Energy Buildings: A Critical Pathway to Zero Net Energy Buildings.

Four reasons we can breathe easy despite the Supreme Court’s stay;"Earlier this week the Supreme Court granted a motion to stay the Clean Power Plan while the DC Circuit Court hears arguments. That means there is a freeze on the rulemaking process while the CPP goes through legal challenges in the DC Court. What does it mean for energy efficiency?
Not much. Here’s why:
1. Regulation of CO2 from power plants is still going to happen. The Clean Air Act requires EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from major emitters. They’ve done it for cars, and power plants are next on the list.
2. Energy efficiency is still a powerful tool. Energy efficiency reduces greenhouse gases. It also reduces nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and mercury. Energy efficiency is the one-stop shop for protecting public health. It saves water. It creates jobs. It makes people’s homes safer and more comfortable. We should continue to think about energy efficiency as a tool to address climate change, but greenhouse gases are only a piece of the pie. In order to protect natural resources and provide reliable and affordable electricity, states need to plan with the big picture in mind.
3. State responses will vary, but most state regulators will continue to plan for the future. In recent months, several states combined the collective resources of their air, energy, and utility regulators to take a holistic approach to ensuring clean, reliable, affordable electricity for the public. The Supreme Court stay may buy them some time, but prudent regulators will take advantage of this opportunity to understand the ways they can achieve their goals at the lowest cost. Energy efficiency will very often be their answer.
4. There’s lots of work to do. We can use this time as an opportunity. Energy efficiency is viewed by many as a generally good idea, but historically it hasn’t been well understood outside certain circles. More recently it’s moved front and center as a pollution reduction strategy. The Clean Power Plan bolstered that trend. But it takes time to become well versed in all the facets of programs and policies, the costs, the benefits, the best practices, and how things work. We can use this time to work with low-income and environmental justice advocates, labor groups, air regulators, health groups, and others to help ensure that everyone understands the role energy efficiency can play in achieving all our goals.
Momentum is on our side. People are learning and engaged. States are working hard to leave a legacy for future generations that we can all be proud of.
Stay? We don’t think so.

It’s time to implement good industrial energy efficiency programs in your state.;"The industrial sector represents a big opportunity for low-cost energy savings from utility energy efficiency programs. In general, investments in energy efficiency lower operating costs for manufacturers, which increases their productivity and improves competitiveness. When these investments are made through utility programs, businesses get the added value of access to technical expertise, project implementation support, and financial incentives that reduce initial costs. Plus, industrial programs help states comply with the Clean Power Plan. Despite these obvious benefits, many states and large energy users harness only a fraction of their industrial energy efficiency potential.
To help state-level stakeholders communicate the value of investments in energy efficiency by industrial, commercial, and institutional customers, we’ve created four new fact sheets. Each one focuses on a particular issue related to achieving greater program participation by the largest energy users (click the title to download).
Industrial Efficiency Programs Can Achieve Large Energy Savings at Low Cost. This overview of the benefits of industrial programs includes a list of 10 tips for designing good programs.
The Dollars and Cents of Industrial Efficiency Program Investment. Want to know how the combined investment of utility and customer dollars saves more energy and provides added value to customers? This is a must-read.
Myths and Facts about Industrial Opt-Out Provisions. The arguments often made in favor of allowing industrial customers to opt out of energy efficiency programs don’t hold water. In this fact sheet, you’ll find out why.
Overview of Large-Customer Self-Direct Options for Energy Efficiency Programs. This one outlines the status of self-direct programs and opt-out provisions by state, and includes tips for designing successful self-direct programs.
To create these resources, we interviewed dozens of stakeholders from efficiency organizations, regulatory agencies, utilities, and program implementers to learn more about the barriers they face in adopting large-customer energy efficiency programs. We focused our discussions in two states, Mississippi and Pennsylvania. Mississippi launched their first statewide utility energy efficiency programs in 2013, and recent activities there have been focused on ensuring the programs are well structured and effectively marketed to all customers. In Pennsylvania, electric distribution companies have offered efficiency programs since 2008, and efforts there are focused on maintaining participation in the programs and continuing to achieve high levels of savings. The lessons learned in each state are contained in the fact sheets and broadly applicable across the country.

Fuel-efficient heavy trucks are on the horizon;"Heavy-duty vehicles (more than 8,500 lbs. gross vehicle weight) are central to our economy: tractor-trailers carry goods, vocational trucks and heavy pickups help provide services, and transit buses transport passengers. In 2015, heavy-duty vehicles represented only 5% of on-road vehicles but consumed 30% of all highway fuel. Tractor trucks dominate this sector, accounting for about two-thirds of heavy-duty oil consumption, followed by vocational vehicles and heavy pickups.
Efforts to improve the fuel efficiency of heavy-duty vehicles got a major legislative boost in 2007 with the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA), which mandated fuel efficiency standards for these vehicles. Accordingly, the Department of Transportation (DOT) adopted the first ever heavy-duty vehicle fuel efficiency standards in 2011, in parallel with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These ""Phase 1"" standards took advantage of existing ""off-the-shelf"" technologies to reduce heavy-duty fuel consumption by 15%, on average, from 2010 levels in 2017. The Phase 1 rule has been a successful program, but there are several areas that can be strengthened to further curb oil consumption in this sector. 
DOT and EPA have proposed a second phase of the rule, which is expected to be adopted this summer. The proposed Phase 2 standards would reduce new heavy-duty vehicles’ fuel consumption by an additional 24%, on average, in 2027. Future trucks will be equipped with advanced technologies like waste heat recovery for engines, dual clutch transmissions, highly aerodynamic tractors, and fuel efficient trailers with skirts, gap reducers, and boat tails. These improvements are cost-effective, paying back upfront costs in fuel savings within 2 years (tractor trucks) to 6 years (vocational vehicles). The heavy-duty vehicle standards will further establish US leadership in advanced truck and engine manufacturing and, as proposed, save almost 1.5 million barrels of oil per day in 2040. The proposed standards would also bring heavy-duty fuel consumption back below 2015 levels by 2030, despite rapidly growing truck activity levels. Absent further fuel efficiency improvements beyond 2027, however, oil consumption from these vehicles would begin to rise again after 2033.

Yes, saving energy is cheaper than making energy.;"Utilities have options when it comes to meeting customer demand for electricity. They can build power plants to convert fossil fuels to energy. They can capture renewable resources like solar and wind. And they can work with residents and businesses to lower demand by implementing energy efficiency programs.
Unlike a solar panel installation or a natural gas plant, you might not see energy efficiency on your daily commute. But it’s a very real resource with a very compelling reason for utilities to invest in it: it’s typically the lowest-cost way to meet customers’ energy needs. By helping customers install efficient appliances, insulate their homes and buildings, and refine operations and maintenance practices, utilities are investing in the lowest cost energy resource out there.
Levelized Cost of Energy Resources
Energy efficiency programs aimed at reducing energy waste cost utilities less than three cents per kilowatt hour, while generating the same amount of electricity from sources such as fossil fuels can cost two to three times more. This isn’t a surprising result. Energy efficiency has remained consistent as the lowest-cost resource over the past decade even as program administrators have become more ambitious, capturing more energy savings in more markets and in more creative ways.
Investments in energy efficiency can have a big effect. In fact, in the Pacific Northwest, over half of the region’s growth in demand for electricity since 1978 has been met with energy efficiency. By choosing this low-cost resource, utilities have saved customers about $3.75 billion per year.
Energy efficiency has a host of other benefits, too. It’s clean, readily available, and reliable. It can increase comfort in homes and offices, and spur economic development in cities and towns. Utilities that invest in energy efficiency do so because it makes financial sense for them, but the payoffs accrue to everyone.

More Electric Cars than Ever on Greenest Vehicles List;"Electric Vehicles Nab 9 out of Top 12 Spots in ACEEE’s Environmental Vehicle Rankings 
Washington, DC—Despite a tumultuous year for the automotive industry, manufacturers have continued to offer exciting technology options for a growing vehicle market. Today at greenercars.org, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy released its 19th annual comprehensive environmental ratings for vehicles.
The following vehicles comprise the Greenest List for 2016:
The Smart ForTwo Electric Drive tops the Greenest List for the third year in a row with an unprecedented Green Score of 63. Toyota’s Prius line performs exceedingly well once again, with the new Prius Eco nabbing the 4th spot, while the Prius C and original Prius claim spots #8 and #9. For the first time ever, the Greenest list is completely populated by plug-in and hybrid vehicles; not a single vehicle with only an internal combustion engine appears. This is partly due to the disappearance from the American market of a few of the longstanding entries on the Greenest List, including the Honda Civic Natural Gas. However, the conventional Smart ForTwo and Chevrolet Spark hover just below the Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid.
“The 2016 scores are in, and plug-in electric vehicles are outpacing all other vehicle offerings in terms of environmental friendliness. Fortunately, the electricity sector is slated to become cleaner over the life of model year 2016 vehicles, thanks to the Clean Power Plan, and that has bumped up electric vehicles’ green scores this year. Nevertheless, it’s important to acknowledge that how green your electric vehicle truly is depends on the electricity it uses to charge,” said ACEEE lead vehicle analyst Shruti Vaidyanathan.
The newest additions to the list are the Volkswagen eGolf and the Kia’s Soul electric vehicle, which claim the #5 and #7 spots respectively. This year marks the first time a Kia vehicle has earned a top spot since 2009. The improved 2016 Chevrolet Volt also nabs a spot this year (#11) thanks to significant increases in fuel economy and its new streamlined vehicle design. Once again this year, a diverse array of manufacturers are represented among the top 12 vehicles, including two American manufacturers.
Modern clean diesels have repeatedly placed well in ACEEE’s annual rankings, only a few places away from the “Greenest” list. However, following the EPA announcement that Volkswagen has cheated federal emissions standards since 2009 with the use of defeat devices, greenercars.org suspended its Green Scores for all affected VW, Audi, and Porsche diesel models.
Greenercars.org identifies practical options in each class among the top widely available, automatic transmission, petroleum-fueled models, since many of the vehicles on the Greenest list are not widely available. The Greener Choices list includes trucks and SUVs, such as the Chevrolet Trax and the GMC Canyon. The gasoline-powered Chevrolet Spark and Honda Fit top their respective car classes. As the list demonstrates, consumers can make greener choices whatever their vehicle needs may be. Domestic manufacturers claimed five of the 12 Greener Choices spots:
Greenercars.org provides the facts necessary to examine the eco-performance of any 2016 model. The site assigns each vehicle a Green Score, a single measure that incorporates lifecycle greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions. Updates to this year’s methodology include new estimates of emissions from fuel sourcing, transportation, and distribution as well as Clean Power Plan adjustments to electricity emissions.
The Meanest List this year is comprised of one pickup, heavier medium-duty vehicles, and a handful of European sports cars that are the least friendly to the environment. Vehicles with very low sales units are omitted from this list, and this year Class 2b pickups weighing above 8,500 lbs. were not rated:
  In addition to highlighting the year’s Greenest, Meanest, Greener Choices, and best-in-class lists, the greenercars.org website features informative write-ups on model year 2016 highlights, a consumer primer on vehicles and the environment, and advice on how to buy green when shopping for a new car or truck.
Green Scores of the 1,000+ configurations of all model year 2016 vehicles are available for free in the greenercars.org interactive database, along with each configuration’s fuel economy, health-related pollution impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions. Visitors to the database can also build custom lists for comparing vehicles.

Electricity savings keep rising, year after year;"Electric utilities and independent statewide program administrators deliver a substantial share of efficiency programs across the country. Some utilities have delivered such programs for decades. Since the mid-2000s, though, the size and scope of the programs have grown dramatically. Today, utilities and administrators implement energy efficiency programs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Incremental electricity savings, or, savings attributed to new programs implemented in a given year, have risen steadily over the past decade. And since most efficiency measures continue to generate savings for residents and businesses for years after they are installed, the total annual impact of efficiency programs is dramatic.
Electricity savings from utility sector energy efficiency programs by year
Source: ACEEE analysis of data from EIA Form 861and EIA Annual Energy Review. Total annual savings in 2013 and 2014 estimated by ACEEE because EIA no longer provides this figure. Incremental annual savings are savings from measures installed that year. Total annual savings are those achieved in a year from measures installed that year and in prior years.
In 2014, ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs saved more than 180 billion kWh of electricity for residents and businesses across the US. About 26.5 billion kWh of savings came from new measures implemented that year, while an additional 155 billion kWh of savings was generated from measures put in place in prior years. These large-scale savings are equivalent to more than 4% of electricity consumption in 2014.
Electricity savings are likely to continue to grow as states ramp-up savings in response to energy savings goals, and utilities develop new and creative ways of delivering energy efficiency to their customers. These electricity savings have a real impact on households and businesses: efficiency keeps money in people’s pockets, creates jobs, and reduces the environmental impact of energy use. As more utilities turn to energy efficiency as a clean, low-cost, and effective way to meet demand, we expect that electricity savings will continue to rise.

Want to weigh your state’s Clean Power Plan compliance options? Check out our new SUPR 2 calculator;"In October 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published its Clean Power Plan (CPP) final rule, regulating greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. Now that the final rule has been released, policymakers, state governments, utility and power plant owners, and other stakeholders are weighing their options to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) from the power sector for compliance with the rule. As states consider plans to submit to EPA, they will want to evaluate the costs of their compliance options, but comparing different strategies can be complex. To assist states in exploring the cost and pollution reduction potential of different options, ACEEE has created the State and Utility Pollution Reduction Calculator Version 2 (SUPR 2). This tool is an updated version of the SUPR Calculator, originally released by ACEEE in April 2015. SUPR 2 reflects the new data and requirements in EPA’s Clean Power Plan final rule (the previous version was based on the draft rule). 
The purpose of the SUPR 2 calculator is to provide policymakers and stakeholders with a rough estimate of some of the costs and benefits of different policies and technologies that could help a state meet its air quality goals. Users can select from a list of 19 different policies and technologies—including energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear power, emission control options, and natural gas—to build a compliance scenario for their state. SUPR 2 shows users how much their scenario will cost and what they will get for that investment in just 4 easy steps: 
For example, under the CPP, Pennsylvania is required to reduce its emissions by 25%, relative to its 2012 adjusted emissions baseline. In SUPR 2, you can pick from our options to see what you would need to do to comply with the rule. If you select an annual 1.5% energy savings target, building codes (high), combined heat and power (medium), ESCO programs, and utility-scale solar PV (high), the results show that those policies together can achieve a 20% reduction in 2012 emissions, at a lower cost than many other compliance options. In addition, you can see in the figure—one of many in the calculator—how close the selected policies get the state to its goal.
SUPR 2 results for Pennsylvania
SUPR 2 is an easy-to-use tool for exploring the cost and pollution reduction potential of a variety of compliance options. Try out the SUPR 2 calculator to see how your state could comply with the CPP. Please contact Cassandra Kubes (ckubes@aceee.org) for more information about SUPR 2, or for help understanding your state’s results.

The amazing drop in home appliance energy use;"Appliance efficiency has increased remarkably over the past several decades. The graph below tracks the energy efficiency of four household appliances over a 35-year period. Three of the products (clothes washers, central air conditioners, and refrigerators), show a 50% or greater reduction in energy use over that period, and the fourth product, gas furnaces, shows a smaller but still significant reduction of 18%.
The decline in energy use parallels the rise of appliance efficiency standards, first at the state level, and then at the federal level. In the 1980s, California and a handful of states set standards for refrigerators, air conditioners, and other home appliances. Federal standards came into play in 1987, when Congress passed a bill that was supported by manufacturers and efficiency advocates. Today, the Department of Energy (DOE) sets minimum energy and water efficiency levels for household and commercial appliances, equipment, and lighting, creating savings for consumers and businesses.
Relative average energy consumption of new appliances sold over the 1980-2014 period
Note: 2014 refrigerator and clothes washer data not yet available. Source: ACEEE analysis of data from Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and industry sources.
For the residential products in this graph, it is interesting to note that the greater the number of updates to standards, the greater the decline in energy consumption. National clothes washer standards, which were updated 4 times (effective in 1988, 1994, 2004, 2011), saw the steepest decline (75%); refrigerators with 3 updates (effective in 1990, 1993, 2001 but not including the recent update in 2014) saw a 65% decline; and air conditioners with 2 updates (effective in 1992 and 2006), saw a 50% decline. Gas furnaces, with an 18% drop in efficiency, saw just one standard go into effect over this time period in 1992. Fortunately, DOE has an opportunity to set strong new furnace standards as they complete a rulemaking this year.
Washers, refrigerators, air conditioners, and furnaces are just four of the more than 55 products covered by the DOE appliance standards program. Altogether, efficiency standards adopted since 1987 are on track to save consumers and businesses more than $1 trillion through 2020 and to reduce global warming emissions by nearly 4 billion tons, or the equivalent annual emissions of 800 million automobiles. Savings will continue to grow as new standards for products (e.g., portable air conditioners, wine chillers) are adopted and existing standards for products (e.g., air conditioners, dehumidifiers) are updated.

Looking at studies that are critical of energy efficiency: identifying useful findings and where they fall short;"Several papers in the last few years claim to show that particular energy efficiency programs and policies do not work or are too expensive. We have commented on some of these in blog posts (see here, here, and here), noting that some of them do have useful insights, but also that many of them make serious mistakes.
Have we turned the corner on criticisms of energy efficiency programs and policies?
In recent months, there have been signs that such criticisms may be abating or softening. For example, the E2e project, a source of several of these critical studies, is turning toward some commercial and industrial programs, which tend to have lower costs than the residential programs they have been criticizing. Initial results from one of their residential studies (abstract available here under Allcott) have found that residential weatherization programs are of borderline cost-effectiveness when considering only energy cost savings. This finding is consistent with other studies on these programs (see residential retrofits here), leaving researchers to debate the other benefits of these programs such as improved resident comfort and health.
Unfortunately, not everyone is taking a more measured approach. There are some questionable studies about automobile fuel economy that we will be commenting on in a forthcoming blog post. And, just last week, a study was published by the Fraser Institute in Ontario implying that efficiency programs there are not cost effective. Their conclusion is not based on data from Ontario, but cites previous critical studies of other programs, in particular a controversial study from 1992. Their analysis ignores or downplays other more recent studies that found much lower costs.
New ACEEE paper
Since we expect some studies like this to continue, we thought it would be useful to prepare a paper reviewing a few of the recent studies, identifying useful findings, but also pointing out  a variety of recurring mistakes, such as misunderstanding the programs and markets they are examining or unreasonably extrapolating their findings to areas they did not study. This short paper, which we are releasing today, is written for people who are not evaluation experts, but who are trying to understand what conclusions they should take from these studies. That said, we acknowledge that not all energy efficiency programs are stellar, and that sound evaluation is critical in identifying what is working well and what needs improving.
We conclude our new paper with suggestions for constructively moving forward, such as the need for academic economists and energy efficiency evaluation experts to better understand where the other side is coming from, and to explore opportunities to find a middle ground, potentially even working on some projects together. With cooperation and combined expertise, energy efficiency studies can achieve their intended purpose: to understand what works, and to improve what falls short.

2015 goes out with a burst of new efficiency standards: 2016 promises more action;"The final few weeks of 2015 proved busy ones for new national appliance and equipment standards. The Department of Energy (DOE) completed the biggest energy-saving standard in agency history, along with several important but lower-profile standards which will collectively yield large energy and economic savings. Some of them point the way to much larger future savings. Looking ahead, 2016 looks to be another big year for saving energy and money with improved standards. 
Savings add up
In total, DOE completed or proposed new standards for eight product categories in the closing weeks of 2015. The new commercial rooftop air conditioner standards, a product of a DOE-convened negotiated rulemaking process, made headlines with historic savings levels. But the other seven proposed or final standards also achieve significant savings, adding up to about 1.7 quadrillion Btus of savings over thirty years of product sales, or roughly enough energy to meet the needs of 9.5 million US households for a year. Savings are split among electricity (135 billion kWh in savings) and fossil fuels burned directly in appliances, mostly natural gas (about 440 trillion Btus in savings). DOE’s combined savings estimates for consumers of these products reaches about $9 billion after accounting for the slightly increased cost of more efficient products.
Medium to modest savings but big future potential
Let’s go back in time more than twenty years: a clothes washer final rule completed in 1991 set very modest standards, but also showed that large savings were possible by considering technology step-changes. Front loading washers, then already common in Europe but not yet designed for American preferences for shorter cycle times and larger loads, had the potential to dramatically reduce laundry energy and water use and provide as good or better washing performance. Fast forward to today. After two subsequent rounds of upgrades to standards, new clothes washers use 60-70% less energy and 40-65% less water than pre-1991 products. Even more interesting, even as front loaders have become more popular, top-loading products have achieved efficiency improvements approaching the performance of front loaders, technological improvements that no one predicted in the early 1990s.
Several products for which standards were recently completed or proposed could be the next clothes washer story. New standards for residential boilers and commercial furnaces modestly boost efficiency, but condensing technology could achieve ten times the savings of the recent final rules. European standards for boilers adopted last year have taken this step. Proposed ceiling fan standards achieve good-sized savings by requiring the efficiency performance from brushless permanent magnet motors for fans used in commercial and industrial facilities. Spreading that same energy-saving technology to most residential fans would more than double the savings from the proposed rule. 
New standards for commercial and industrial pumps are a major accomplishment. As my colleague, Joanna Mauer, wrote in her post on the new pump standards, the rating system underlying the new standards, which were negotiated between industry and efficiency advocates, distinguishes variable speed products which can save up to 50% of pumping energy use in some applications. This rating system will provide a framework for utility programs and other efforts which could deliver savings many times larger than the new minimum standards.
For each of these products, although the direct savings from the recent standards are relatively modest, when combined they make a difference. Each points the way to larger savings down the road, through market-driven improvements, efficiency programs, future standards upgrades, or, most likely, some combination. Additional investments to improve these technologies to address barriers to their more widespread adoption will provide the basis for future efficiency progress.
Big opportunities in 2016
While we don’t expect to see any new standard break the record set by commercial air conditioners, 2016 still promises to be an extraordinarily productive one for new standards. With more than one-third of residential energy use dedicated to space cooling and heating, efficiency improvements for these products can yield huge national benefits. A negotiated rulemaking working group is now tackling residential air conditioners and heat pumps. Long-overdue standard upgrades for residential furnaces will finally be completed, helping to boost efficient use of natural gas. These standards build on the 2014 furnace fan standards which address furnaces’ electric energy use and take effect in 2019. This combination of new standards has the potential to provide big gains for how efficiently Americans heat and cool their homes over the next decade.
Another particularly promising standard under development will set the first-ever standards for commercial and industrial fans. A DOE-convened working group advanced work toward new standards in 2015, and we expect DOE to propose efficiency levels early this year. New standards for several other primarily residential products, including swimming pool pumps, dehumidifiers, battery chargers, portable air conditioners, ovens, and certain types of refrigerators, are also scheduled to be completed.
The standards expected in 2016 are sure to add substantially to the more than $1 trillion in consumer savings already being saved by standards, and help meet President Obama’s goal to reduce global warming emissions by three billion tons by 2030 through new standards. The year ahead promises at least as much progress for efficiency standards as the year just finished!

Cars got quicker, more powerful by weight, and more fuel efficient in the last 40 years.;"Over the past 40 years, light-duty vehicles in the United States have achieved remarkable gains in both fuel economy and performance. The graph below shows average miles per gallon, power-to-weight ratio, and 0-to-60 acceleration time of new cars and light trucks since the late 1970s. Fuel economy improved dramatically from 1975 to 1987, driven by the original Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which were adopted in 1975 in response to the 1973 oil embargo by Arab states. Average fuel economy drifted downward for the succeeding 17 years, as CAFE standards remained almost unchanged and the SUV claimed a growing share of the vehicle market. But with legislative and regulatory actions during the Bush and Obama administrations, fuel economy has been on the rise again since 2004, increasing nearly 90% over 1975 levels. 
Meanwhile, power-to-weight ratio and 0-to-60 acceleration times have improved by 63% and 40%, respectively, since 1978. Despite big changes in vehicle size and shape, gasoline price, and fuel economy standards, performance has marched pretty steadily upwards since the early 80s, thanks to incremental improvements in engines, transmissions, materials, and design. The pace of technological advance has picked up with higher CAFE standards, but it remains to be seen whether further reductions in acceleration time, now approaching 8 seconds on average, will still be viewed as a market imperative as greenhouse gas reduction efforts gain momentum.
With a shift to size-based standards mandated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), the CAFE program is now designed to ensure major fuel economy improvement for each vehicle class, while leaving the size distribution of vehicles sold to market forces. This structural change in the standards facilitated the long-sought tightening of standards delivered by EISA, but any sustained shifts in the market toward larger vehicles, and from cars to trucks, could mean that the average fuel economy resulting from the more stringent standards over the next decade will fall short of the expected value.

2015 was a good year for energy efficiency. 2016 could be even better.;"The past year included many successes, including quite a few that we can build on in the new year. Among the notable developments in 2015:
There is growing recognition that energy efficiency is the lowest-cost resource, and investments in energy efficiency continue to grow. The International Energy Agency estimates that more than $300 billion is being invested annually in energy efficiency worldwide, and this figure is growing. This is illustrated in the United States by continued growth in utility energy efficiency spending and savings achieved.
Further efficiency savings are likely to be driven by the recently concluded Paris International Climate Agreement and by the US Clean Power Plan.
States continue to embrace energy efficiency. For example, the Maryland Public Service Commission significantly increased energy savings targets for the state’s utilities, California enacted a law to double statewide energy efficiency savings by 2030, and Massachusetts utilities are proposing to raise electricity savings to nearly 3% per year by 2018.
Cities are becoming increasingly active with their energy efficiency efforts. Atlanta, Portland, and Kansas City all enacted energy benchmarking ordinances covering portions of their building stocks (typically large buildings), and Los Angeles introduced its Sustainable City PLAn, which includes strategies for energy efficiency to deliver savings equivalent to 15% of all of the city's projected electricity use by 2020.
Intelligent efficiency (the systemic approach to saving energy that marries traditional energy efficiency with wireless and cloud-based computer technologies, enhancing our ability to gather, interpret, and act upon energy information in order to improve performance and achieve new levels of energy savings) advanced significantly, with a growing number of innovative companies providing new services.
In Washington, energy efficiency continues to have bipartisan support, with the president signing a modest energy efficiency bill early in the year. It’s notable that energy efficiency was one of the only energy items (along with oil exports and extensions of renewable energy tax incentives) to be enacted (the latter items as part of an end-of-the-year omnibus budget bill). 
There was also substantial progress strengthening energy efficiency standards for equipment and trucks, including new standards for commercial rooftop air conditioners and proposed new standards for heavy duty trucks.
This was also a notable year for ACEEE, as we celebrated our 35th anniversary. We marked this milestone by publishing a paper looking back at energy efficiency accomplishments over the past 35 years and opportunities over the next 35 years. Some of the key graphics on progress can be found in ACEEE’s Data Points series of blogs.
Looking Ahead to 2016
Turning now to the year ahead, we see multiple opportunities: 
States will be looking for opportunities to reduce energy bills and reduce carbon emissions, spurred in part by the Clean Power Plan. We estimate that energy efficiency can achieve more than half of the needed emissions, while reducing energy bills relative to a business-as-usual scenario. States that will be considering ways to expand energy efficiency this year include Mississippi (as part of a process to develop full-scale programs) and Georgia (as part of their IRP process). And cities will continue to look at ways they can improve their resiliency, including expanding energy efficiency opportunities.
Utility sector reform is likely to receive increased attention as reform processes continue in New York, Minnesota, and California, and a few more states may consider similar processes. Rate design is also likely to receive increased attention as utilities seek to cover the costs of serving changing load shapes. We see time-of-use rates getting increased attention, given opposition to other options such as higher fixed charges. The details will be critical, as they will affect whether the changes are helpful or harmful to energy efficiency efforts.
At the national level, final fuel economy standards for heavy trucks are scheduled to be issued this spring, and the Department of Energy plans an ambitious slate of final standards as part of efforts to meet the president’s target for savings from standards. New efficiency standards for manufactured homes are also likely, building on a consensus agreement among stakeholders. And Congress will try to enact energy legislation, although finding something that the House, Senate and the president can agree on will be challenging. (There are some notable efficiency provisions in the current Senate bill, though the current House bill would do more harm to efficiency than good).
And energy efficiency is likely to get some attention in the presidential campaign as several candidates, including Clinton, Kasich, Rubio, and Sanders, have talked about energy efficiency.
On the other hand, there are also likely to be challenges in the coming year. Ohio and Indiana scaled back their utility-funded programs in 2014, and similar challenges periodically crop up in other states. For example, Michigan is currently debating energy efficiency policy, including a possible rollback of energy-saving targets for utilities. Likewise, there are periodic attempts to scale back some federal energy efficiency laws, especially in the House of Representatives. Efficiency supporters need to remain vigilant and push back when needed.
At ACEEE, we will be expanding technical assistance to states and cities, including on the Clean Power Plan and on programs and policies serving low-income communities. We will be conducting research on an array of issues, including intelligent efficiency, utility rates, green banks, and programs targeting low-income households, financing, behavior, and small/medium businesses. We will also be working on the role of energy efficiency in future federal tax reform and we have a full array of six conferences planned.
Overall, substantial progress was made on energy efficiency in 2015, and we are poised to continue this progress in 2016.

First-ever pump efficiency standards reflect industry and advocate consensus;"The Department of Energy (DOE) issued new efficiency standards today for commercial and industrial pumps that are based on efficiency levels negotiated by manufacturers, efficiency advocates, and other stakeholders. In addition to establishing the first-ever national efficiency standards for pumps, the final rule also provides a mechanism for energy efficiency programs to incentivize high-efficiency pump packages.
The new standards apply to clean water pumps between 1 and 200 horsepower, which are used for a wide variety of applications such as irrigation, circulation of hot and cold water in commercial buildings for heating and cooling, and pressure boosting in high-rise apartment buildings. The standards will require the least-efficient 25% of pumps in today’s market to be redesigned to improve efficiency and reduce energy losses.
Pumps meeting the new standards sold over 30 years would reduce electricity consumption by about 30 billion kilowatt-hours, which is equivalent to the annual electricity use of 2.8 million US households, and save customers $0.4-1.1 billion.
The standards reflect efficiency levels that were agreed to by manufacturers, efficiency advocates, pump users, and utilities as part of a negotiated rulemaking, and build on standards established in the European Union.
The new standards are based on a metric which incorporates not just the power consumption of the pump itself, but also of the motor that drives the pump and any controls. In many pump applications, the required flow is variable. Oftentimes, this variable flow is achieved by opening and closing valves, which wastes a significant amount of energy. A better option for variable load applications is to control the pump using a variable speed drive, which adjusts the pump output to just meet the required load and can reduce energy consumption by up to 50% or more. The energy saving benefits of variable speed drives are captured in the new metric, such that a pump with a variable speed drive will have a significantly better rating than a constant-speed pump. The new ratings for pumps will provide additional information to customers for their purchasing decisions, as well as a mechanism for utilities and other efficiency program administrators to incentivize high-efficiency pump packages.
The new pump standards join several others published by DOE in late 2015, including new commercial air conditioner standards.  Based on DOE estimates, the commercial air conditioner standards will save more energy than any other ever established by the agency. 
The new standards for pumps will take effect in 2020.

New Orleans is on the move;"This holiday season, New Orleans residents have cause for celebration as they receive an unexpected holiday gift: a new focus on energy efficiency savings.
Cities are responsible for the majority of energy consumption, and local governments can play a critical role in addressing energy and environmental challenges. So, cities have a real opportunity to lead by pushing for ambitious policies to reduce energy waste in their own backyard. New Orleans’ city council did just that with some recent legislation.
On December 10, the New Orleans City Council called on Entergy New Orleans, the utility serving the city, to ramp up its savings each year to reach a 2% yearly energy savings goal. The resulting resolution was passed with the help of many partner organizations in the region. Resolution No. R-15-599 encourages Entergy New Orleans to ramp up energy efficiency savings from the Energy Smart program, which sends a strong signal about the importance of energy efficiency for New Orleans’ future. These savings will help the city increase its resiliency, energy affordability, human and environmental health, and many other multiple benefits.
An achievable goal
In 2013, ACEEE met with local stakeholders in New Orleans and prepared an energy efficiency potential study and policy guide. The final report, New Orleans’ Efficient Path to 2030, made several policy recommendations, including that the city ramp up its annual savings target to 2% for years after 2020. Several utilities have achieved electric savings levels in excess of 2% of total sales, including National Grid Rhode Island, which saved more than 3% in 2014. While the New Orleans goal is challenging and ambitious, other utilities have recently demonstrated that 2% savings is realistic and achievable. ACEEE will release a report next year discussing utilities that have achieved high levels of energy savings and exploring the potential drivers of those successes.
Moving Up in the South
The Southeast historically has not invested heavily in energy efficiency, but many states and cities in the region are on the move. From 2011 to 2014, southern states made large strides toward energy efficiency, some even being highlighted as “most improved” in the State Scorecard, including Mississippi, West Virginia, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama. In the 2015 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard, many southern cities—including Atlanta, Charlotte, and Jacksonville—greatly improved their 2013 scores through stronger energy efficiency policies. New Orleans and Louisiana ranked towards the bottom in the 2015 Scorecard and 2015 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, but like its peers in the region, New Orleans is on the move. The city council’s vocal commitment to energy savings adds to the upward momentum in the region.
By directing Entergy New Orleans to achieve 2% electricity savings, the New Orleans City Council is pushing the city toward becoming a stronger leader in the South. Entergy New Orleans will have the opportunity to begin implementing the city council’s goal in the new year, and we hope that other cities will follow suit as they plan for a more energy-efficient future.

Vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards are working well, but could fall short of climate goals;"The latest news from the EPA on light-duty vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions is…complicated. There’s good news and not-so-good news, and the array of factors that figure into EPA’s accounts of these matters is mind-boggling for those not tuned into the fine points. This year, the agency simultaneously released its annual report on trends in automotive technology, carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy, and the arcane (but important!) tally of how manufacturers are doing in meeting greenhouse gas emissions standards. Various credit provisions and other features of the standards regimes make it tricky to relate the data on actual performance to the ins and outs of regulatory compliance. We’ll stick to the greenhouse gas emissions compliance data here, but the story for CAFE standards will be similar.
The good news
For model year 2014, as in the two years prior, the auto industry met greenhouse gas emissions requirements with room to spare. The figure below compares the average emissions required (orange) under the standards with the average emissions achieved (blue), which are lower (better) by a good margin. There’ve been many assertions that growing sales of larger vehicles spell trouble for the increasingly stringent fuel economy and emissions requirements, but these claims ignore the fact that the standards adjust automatically to changes in the market by allowing larger vehicles to consume more fuel and emit more climate-warming gases. Manufacturers won’t have a harder time complying with the standards if they sell bigger vehicles – unless their vehicles are inefficient for their size and type.   
Average Light-Duty GHG Emissions: Achieved vs. Required
Source: Data from http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/climate/documents/420r15026.pdf, Table A4.
The not-so-good news
The Paris climate conference focused attention at the highest levels on reducing total GHG emissions globally. From that perspective, the gray line in the figure above, which shows average greenhouse gas emissions requirements as projected when the standards were adopted in 2010, highlights a challenge for the transportation sector. Required values (orange) for 2013-14 are less demanding than projected (gray), largely because the standards adjust to the size and type of vehicle sold. And the discrepancy between projected and actual requirements is increasing as sales of bigger vehicles grows. Average emissions (blue) remain lower than the rule’s projected requirements, but that advantage nearly vanished in model year 2014, and the trend is not encouraging.   
Moreover, that advantage disappears altogether if we take away the credits manufacturers receive for producing flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) that can run on ethanol (E85). Those vehicles in fact run almost entirely on gasoline and hence deliver no real reductions in petroleum consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. Some manufacturers are relying heavily on those paper reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; without them, the gap between achieved values and the projected requirement disappears altogether in 2015.
The bottom line
EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have embarked on a mandatory “midterm review” of the fuel economy and GHG emissions standards in place out to 2025. The recent data indicate that the program should pass muster from a technological and structural perspective: it’s working well and driving technology improvements at a manageable clip—the  industry is both complying and thriving. At the same time, the trend is towards a shortfall in what we ultimately need in the coming years: dramatic, absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption. Long-term priorities dictate that, in the midterm review, the agencies take a hard look at current advances in vehicle technologies and see whether more can be done to ensure absolute efficiency gains at a robust rate, even in the face of market shifts towards larger vehicles.

Energy efficiency and industry: the national trend;"The industrial sector, which includes dozens of individual industries spanning agriculture, forestry, fisheries, construction, mining, and manufacturing, accounts for about one-fifth of the US gross domestic product. Industry is unique among the end-use sectors in that its energy intensity has declined consistently over the past 35 years, as can be seen in the figure below. During this period, energy use has fluctuated within a limited range even as the sector output has grown almost 50%, and as economic activity has risen and fallen with economic cycles. Overall, industrial energy intensity declined 38% over the 1980–2013 period.
Industrial energy consumption, value of shipments, and energy intensity, 1977–2013
Source: ACEEE analysis based on various EIA sources
The graph represents a composite of all these industries. (The data for each individual industry is impractical to graph because of number, diversity, and business cycles in individual industries.) For the sector as a whole, an inverse relationship exists between intensity and value of shipments, reflecting the relationship of utilization of capacity in industry, which indicates the economic health of the sector. (“Value of shipments” measures the economic value of all products shipped from industrial plants in an industry.)
While some of this change in intensity is a result of structural shifts in the industrial sector, much of it can be attributed to technology and practice improvements in energy-intensive industries, which account for over four-fifths of the sector energy use. For example, the steel industry has made major modernization investments, which have resulted in a 28% reduction in Btus per ton of steel produced between 1990 and 2004. A large factor in this improvement has been a shift toward more reliance on secondary steel (recycled steel) and less reliance on primary steel (from iron ore through a reduction process). Importantly, this shift from primary to secondary product was enabled by the development of technology that allows the use of scrap to produce high-strength steel alloys.
Also contributing to reducing industrial energy use are system approaches, such as combined heat and power (CHP). CHP is an energy-efficient method of generating both electricity and useful thermal energy in a single, integrated system that is used in many energy intensive industries. A CHP system saves energy by recovering heat that would otherwise be wasted from power-only generation and using it to satisfy on-site thermal energy needs. The chemical industry has reduced energy use per unit of product by about 40% since 1980 by expanding CHP installations and modernizing process technology.
As the  adoption of new techniques, such as smart manufacturing and intelligent efficiency, continues, so should  industrial energy intensity’s downward trend.

Manufacturers, Efficiency Groups Praise Largest Energy-Saving Standards Ever Issued;"Standards the result of negotiations among broad group of stakeholders
Washington, DC—Energy efficiency standards issued today for rooftop air conditioners and heat pumps—which represent the largest energy and pollution savings of any rule ever issued by the Department of Energy—will benefit businesses, manufacturers, and the environment, according to four of the organizations that participated in the negotiations leading to the announcement.  
The Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) representing manufacturers, the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) joined other stakeholders in the negotiations.*
The new standards are expected to save 1.7 trillion kilowatt hours over 30 years of sales, or almost as much energy as created by all the coal burned in the United States to generate electricity in a year. Rooftop air conditioners cool about half the commercial floor space in the nation. DOE also set standards for commercial warm air furnaces, which are typically installed with the rooftop commercial air conditioners.
“DOE is ringing in the holiday season with truly monumental energy and economic savings,” said Andrew deLaski, ASAP executive director. “Huge energy bill savings, enormous emissions reductions, and a clear regulatory roadmap will spread good cheer to the businesses that pay cooling bills, to the environment, and to the manufacturers that make these products.”
Based on DOE’s estimates, the new rooftop air conditioner standards will save more energy and cut more emissions than any other standards completed by the agency, outpacing the previous record-setters that covered electric motors (2014) and fluorescent tube lamps (2009). DOE estimates that the new standards will save businesses as much as $50 billion in energy costs.
Stephen Yurek, president and CEO of AHRI, praised the DOE-convened negotiation process that brought together 17 stakeholders including representatives of individual manufacturers, installers, utilities, environmental groups, and efficiency organizations. “The consensus agreement provides our members with certainty while providing benefits for consumers and businesses.”  
“As in Paris, when the community of nations made history by banding together to fight climate change, these historic efficiency standards were the result of an accord reached by stakeholders who set aside their competing interests for the common good,” said NRDC President Rhea Suh. “These are very, very promising days in the global fight to slow, stop, and reverse climate change, the central environmental challenge of our time.”
Steve Nadel, executive director of ACEEE said: “These standards are a game-changer for the commercial sector. Industry and advocates worked closely together to help produce the biggest energy savings standards in US history. These new standards will bring down the cost of doing business and improve bottom lines by letting companies invest money they used to spend on heating and cooling. This will in turn stimulate the economy, create jobs, and bring us closer to the finish line of the president's climate goals for appliance standards.”
Rooftop air conditioners are typically found on low-rise buildings such as big box stores, schools, apartment buildings, restaurants, and offices. The new standards would net a typical building owner between $4,200 and $10,100 over the life of a single rooftop air conditioner. Moreover, unlike a typical household that has just one central air conditioning unit, commercial spaces have multiple units, and therefore may enjoy bigger savings. A typical big box store, for example, often has over 20 units. And that’s just one building among millions of commercial facilities across the country.
The rooftop air conditioner standards will take effect in two phases, increasing minimum efficiency by about 10% as of January 1, 2018, and by 25–30% as of January 1, 2023. Standards for new warm air furnaces that are typically installed as a unit with a commercial air conditioner also become effective in 2023.

Score your community’s efficiency efforts with the updated Local Self-Scoring Tool;"The 2015 City Scorecard ranks 51 large US cities across five policy areas on their policies and efforts to save energy. Its focus on policies and other initiatives is meant to identify and highlight important actions cities can take to become more efficient. In the process, it offers the beginnings of an efficiency roadmap for any city that wants to save more energy.
The City Scorecard’s metrics can also be used to evaluate other communities beyond the large ones included in the report. All communities, large and small, have the potential to lead on energy efficiency. With the updated 2015 Local Energy Efficiency Self-Scoring Tool released today, communities can evaluate their progress on energy efficiency efforts to get a better understanding of where they stand in relation to peers.
Comparing against peers
Because the largest cities have already been scored in the City Scorecard, we imagine small and medium-sized communities will be the primary users of the tool. To enable these communities to compare their efforts against localities of similar size, we scored eight “peer communities” and embedded their scores in the tool. The peer communities are Arlington County, Virginia; Boulder, Colorado; Burlington, Vermont; Charlottesville, Virginia; Knoxville, Tennessee; Madison, Wisconsin; Park City, Utah; and Lawrence, Kansas. Each community’s score and policy information is available in the ACEEE State and Local Policy Database.
Scoring your community
If you want to know how your community ranks, you can find out by answering multiple-choice questions associated with the metrics in the City Scorecard. If you do score your community, we encourage you to return the results to us by sending the completed Self-Scoring Tool to cityscorecard@aceee.org.
We will verify the data (time and resources permitting), and may even include policy information and scores for your community in the State and Local Policy Database. The database details energy efficiency program and policy information for over 60 jurisdictions and provides you with an opportunity to showcase your community’s efforts.
A conversation with an Arlington, Virginia program analyst
To get a perspective on how communities can be successful, we spoke with someone from Arlington County, which received the top score among the eight communities included in the tool. Below is a Q&A with energy program analyst Jeannine Altavilla (listed as JA below) of the Arlington Initiative to Rethink Energy (AIRE).
ACEEE: Jeannine, what have been the most effective energy efficiency programs Arlington County has implemented to save energy?
JA: Arlington’s most successful energy efficiency program has been the Green Games, in which over 15 million square feet of commercial office property competed for energy and water savings across one year (against a prior year baseline). The county offered more than 40 training and networking events. Arlington estimates the businesses generated over $2 million in utility savings, with the average ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager rating of the 55 participating properties increasing from 73 to 76 over the one-year program.
ACEEE: You must have encountered obstacles while implementing the Green Games or other programs. Based on your successes and general experience with overcoming hurdles, what advice do you have for other localities working to improve energy efficiency?
JA: Establish and maintain relationships. The Green Games was successful in large part because it was a ”high touch” program. Talk about your successes and gain allies in all parts of your organization and beyond. So much of energy efficiency is behind the scenes and quickly forgotten. Make participation interesting and fun, and find ways to talk about savings when a project is newly completed.
ACEEE: Where do you see the greatest (untapped) potential for energy efficiency in Arlington County and how are you working to tap that potential?
JA: Energy-efficient lighting is still grossly under-used in Arlington (and across Virginia). The emergence of linear LED tubes as replacements for common fluorescent lighting in commercial buildings will yield a dramatic reduction in electricity demand. Arlington offered a lighting rebate program during a hiatus in the utility lighting rebate program. Also, our LED Light Bulb Swap campaign distributed 1,626 efficient LED light bulbs and exchanged them for old inefficient light bulbs at events throughout the county. We will continue to promote (and incentivize, as we are capable) modernization of lighting.

Independent Reports Reach Same Conclusions on the Future of Energy Efficiency Evaluation, Measurement, and Verification;"Washington, DC—ACEEE and Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) released new reports today that analyze the current and future impacts of information and communications technologies (ICT) on evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) practices. EM&V demonstrates the value of energy efficiency programs by providing accurate, transparent, and consistent assessments of their performance. Both reports provide similar conclusions regarding the potential of advanced data analytics and the availability of data to provide more timely feedback on program results and efficacy, and reduce costs associated with EM&V.
“The ACEEE report illustrates the potential of ICT to not only sustain the existing efficiency program models, but to transform them,” said Ethan Rogers, senior manager of the Industrial Program at ACEEE. “Programs may look very different in the future as a result of our ability to collect and analyze energy performance in near real-time.”
“The NEEP Changing EM&V Paradigm report presents the potential for how advanced data collection and analytic tools can increasingly support EM&V activities, and provides guidance on key opportunities and challenges in advancing the use of automated measurement,” said NEEP Regional EM&V Forum director Julie Michals.
Both reports focus on the ability of ICT to support and improve existing EM&V practices, as well as create new methods that can be built into an efficiency program’s design. One important advance is the use of comparison groups of customers that are not participating in a program but are similar in their energy use to those that are. Automated and advanced analysis of comparison groups with program participants improves the accuracy and timeliness of energy savings reports, allowing programs to scale more easily and at lower costs.
ACEEE and NEEP also examine the barriers to broader use of ICT in project and program evaluation. The NEEP analysis focuses on where and how new data analytic tools and better data availability interface with current program impact evaluation core elements, and identifies opportunities for streamlining the ""traditional"" evaluation process. The ACEEE analysis focuses on the current uses of ICT to identify opportunities and measure savings in the commercial and industrial sectors and discusses the long-term implications of ICT to do the same for all sectors.
NEEP’s report, which was developed for the Regional EM&V Forum by DNV GL, includes several case studies of advanced data analytic tools that provide services to program administrators with program experiences and results. The report calls for standardized protocols for automated analysis, and describes important testing efforts underway by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
The ACEEE report examines the potential of ICT to transform the nature of energy efficiency by facilitating greater participation from the financial sector in funding energy efficiency. The report also explores participation by programs and third parties in energy capacity markets such as those run by ISO New England and the PJM Interconnection.
Both reports conclude that the rapid evolution of automated EM&V tools are not necessarily aligned with many current state public utility commission energy efficiency program evaluation policies. The reports identify key barriers that need to be addressed, and suggest collaborative efforts to support scaling up the use of ICT-enabled EM&V. Both note that these efforts will be challenging but will ultimately result in better efficiency programs that have lower administrative costs, provide real-time performance feedback, and produce greater energy savings.
“Both ACEEE and NEEP’s reports are important contributions to the existing body of knowledge of EM&V,” said Dian Grueneich, senior research scholar with the Precourt Energy Efficiency Center at Stanford University and commissioner emeritus of the California Public Utilities Commission. “The ICT-enabled advances and recommendations for next steps outlined in the reports will increase confidence in the results of efficiency programs and drive investment to create a more energy-efficient economy and a cleaner environment for all Americans.”

DOE just issued a proposed rule for ceiling fans and a final rule for ceiling fan light kits;"Yesterday, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued two rules affecting ceiling fans: a proposed rule that would establish the first efficiency performance standards for ceiling fans, and a final rule that improves the efficiency of the lights attached to ceiling fans.
The proposed ceiling fan standards would save about 11% of the energy used by ceiling fans.  Energy savings would more than double, though, if DOE adopted a standard level based on advanced motor technology for residential ceiling fans.
Ceiling fans meeting the proposed new standards sold over 30 years would reduce national electricity consumption by about 80 billion kilowatt-hours, an amount equal to the annual energy consumption of over 7 million US households, and would net savings of $0.8-$2.8 billion for purchasers.
Most residential ceiling fans are sold with light kits, which are required to come packaged with light bulbs. DOE’s final rule revising the existing energy efficiency standard for ceiling fan light kits will reduce the amount of energy used by ceiling fan lights by 3.6%, and will come into effect in early 2019.
Over the next 30 years, ceiling fan light kits meeting the new standards will reduce national electricity consumption by about 14.4 million kilowatt-hours, equivalent to the annual average electricity consumed by 1.4 million homes. These savings will be worth $500 - $660 million to purchasers.
About 80 million US households use at least one ceiling fan, and a quarter of all households use four or more ceiling fans. The standards issued today would cover both ceiling fans used in homes as well as ceiling fans that provide higher airflows for use in commercial and industrial applications.
There is a huge spread in the efficiencies of currently available ceiling fans. For example, just within ceiling fans that meet the current ENERGY STAR® specification, at high speed the most-efficient fans are more than five times more efficient than the least-efficient models.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) established prescriptive standards for ceiling fans, requiring, for example, that they have adjustable speed controls. However, there are currently no performance standards for ceiling fans. The new proposed standards would require minimum energy efficiency levels, expressed as airflow delivered in cubic feet per minute per unit of power consumption in watts.
According to data published with the proposed rule, standard residential ceiling fans complying with the proposed rule would cut consumers’ electricity costs to operate fans by about 40% compared with the least efficient fans on the market. DOE estimates that the purchase price would increase by only about $12 with the proposed standards, and that that additional cost would be covered by energy bill savings within 2 years.
The efficiency of ceiling fans can be improved by using more-efficient motors and fan blades and by optimizing the fan design, such as by adjusting the blade pitch.
During the rulemaking process, some manufacturers objected to a potential standard based on brushless DC motors, which can reduce power consumption by about 60%. The proposed standards issued today for residential ceiling fans could be met using more-efficient conventional induction motors that can reduce power consumption by about 10%. Although DOE did not propose standards based on brushless DC motors for residential ceiling fans, the large savings they deliver could provide the basis for an updated ENERGY STAR specification.  The proposed performance standard levels for fans designed for commercial and industrial applications are based on advanced, brushless DC motors.
Most ceiling fans have flat blades, although some have “unconventional” blades, such as blades in the shape of a palm leaf, which are generally less efficient than flat blades. In response to some manufacturers’ concerns, the efficiency levels evaluated for the proposed rule can all be met by both flat blade as well as unconventional blade fans. In addition, today’s proposed rule would exempt “highly decorative” ceiling fans, which would be defined as fans incapable of spinning at high speeds or moving very much air.
In its final rule on ceiling fan light kits, DOE closed a loophole which had allowed light bulbs with smaller bases to meet a less-demanding standard. DOE decided not to require a level of energy efficiency that can currently only be met by Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps, despite the fact that its own analysis showed that doing so would yield greater net benefits to purchasers than the lower efficiency level that was eventually chosen for the standard. The revised ceiling fan light kit standard will require CFLs or LEDs used to meet a slightly higher efficiency level than under the previous standard, preserving a wide range of choices for ceiling fan light kit buyers.
The final rule for ceiling fan efficiency is due by July 2016, and the new standards would take effect three years later.

The housing effect and its impact on residential energy use;"Energy efficiency comes into a house from many directions: standards make appliances, equipment, and electronics more efficient, building codes ensure the right amount of insulation and ventilation, utility programs help families manage their energy use, and smart technology saves money with programmable thermostats and energy-sipping LED lighting. So it may come as a surprise that, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), on-site residential energy consumption actually grew 8.9% from 1980 to 2009.
Over the same period, energy use per household was relatively stable, with some fluctuation largely attributable to weather and economic conditions. So what explains the growth in consumption? The graph below shows the impact of different factors on the overall change in residential energy use. It’s obvious that the main drivers of increased energy use are (1) the growing number of homes (or “housing effect”) resulting from population growth, and (2) the shift to bigger houses. Much of the impact of these drivers was offset by energy efficiency improvements (or reduced “intensity”), with smaller contributions from population shifts (from colder Northern to more moderate Southern and Western regions), weather, and changes in the mix of housing types.

Since EIA conducted their analysis on site rather than source energy use, energy losses from electricity generation and distribution are not included, and as a result the full impact of growing electricity use for air-conditioning and household electronics is not addressed. The good news is, as new houses have been added to existing stock during that period, energy efficiency has had a big hand in preventing an explosion of energy consumption.

Why economists and practitioners need to work together to improve energy efficiency programs;"In the past year, a growing number of papers from economists have questioned the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs and policies. We have reviewed many of these studies and blogged about several of them (see here, here, here and here). In general, we have found that some of these studies have useful lessons, but too often they miss the mark because they miss some key issues in the programs they are evaluating, or they seek to over-generalize their findings to programs very different from the ones they evaluated. But rather than continuing a tit-for-tat debate, I want to go past some of these details and look more broadly at how economists and energy efficiency practitioners can better avoid these past problems, better understand each other, and better work together.
There is much to learn
First, we admit that not all energy efficiency programs are stellar. It’s critical to have good evaluation to help tell what is working well and what needs improving. For example, one of the useful findings from the recent but controversial Fowlie et al. evaluation of the low-income weatherization program in several Michigan communities is that the energy audits in this program were overestimating the energy savings that can be achieved. Fortunately, as my colleague Jennifer Amann recently wrote, other research has found that calibrating audits to actual energy bills can do much to address this problem. This is an example of how identifying a problem can help lead to solutions.
Getting beyond paradigms to discover the truth
Second, there is a tendency, in both the economics and energy efficiency communities, to work from established paradigms and work with colleagues who share similar views. When the two communities meet they often talk past each other. There is a need for both sides to better understand where the other side is coming from, and to explore opportunities to find a middle ground. For example, many economists look for rigorous evaluation, preferring what they call the “gold standard:” randomized control trials in which a large group of potential participants is randomly assigned to either a study or control group. But randomized control trials can be very difficult to implement, as the recent recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics has discussed. This is particularly a problem for full-scale programs in which everyone is eligible and random assignment to a control is not possible. On the other hand, the energy efficiency community in recent years has increased use of “deemed savings estimates,” since these are easier to use and provide certainty for program implementers. Deemed savings estimates are supposed to be based on prior evaluations, but these evaluations are not always as rigorous or frequent as would be ideal. Perhaps the two sides could agree on more frequent “quasi-experimental” studies that carefully select a control group that is not randomized.
The need to be objective
Third, both communities need to be fair and objective when they conduct studies, and not seek to bias the results or report valid results in a biased manner. Study designs that implicitly tilt the playing field in one direction are more rhetoric than useful investigation of what is happening. Examples of tilting the field include studies that look at only costs but not benefits (see here for example), include extra costs unrelated to energy efficiency (e.g. home repair costs), leave out important costs out such as changes in maintenance costs or are based on a simple cost-benefit framework without considering other goals that the programs might have. Likewise, each program is different and one problematic program should not cast doubt on all of the others, particularly dissimilar programs (see here for example). Conclusions can only be generalized to similar programs.
Combining skills to create the best research possible
So how can we better work together? First, rather than each community conducting separate studies, perhaps economists and energy efficiency practitioners can jointly work together on some studies, as each profession brings useful skills, perspectives and information. Economists tend to be good at research methods and statistics but they don’t always understand the markets they are evaluating (see here for example). By coupling economists with knowledgeable practitioners, many of these problems can be avoided. Likewise, it would be useful to have the other community review studies before they are published, allowing problems to be identified and corrected before publication. Similarly, the two communities can work together to identify good programs that are worth studying, rather than marginal programs that are not typical. Finally, when results are obtained, it can be useful to look not only at the results but why the results happened (see here). In this way, studies can achieve what perhaps we can all agree is the intended purpose: to understand what works, and to improve what falls short.

What is energy intensity, and how does it relate to energy efficiency?;"From 1980 to 2014, energy use in the United States increased from 78 quads (quadrillion Btus) to 98 quads, an increase of 26%. (A quadrillion is 10 to the 15th power.) But over the same period, our gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 149%. A common approach for looking at these two variables together is to examine energy intensity, defined as energy use per real dollar of GDP. Energy intensity declined from 12.1 in 1980 to 6.1 in 2014, a 50% improvement (units are thousand-Btus per 2009 dollar) (from EIA 2015a). This improvement in energy intensity averaged 2.0% per year over this period.

Source: ACEEE analysis based on data in EIA 2015a and Huntington 2009
Energy efficiency was an important contributor to this trend. However, the improvement was also partly due to shifts in the economy away from some energy-intensive segments (e.g., heavy manufacturing). For example, Hillard Huntington, in his 2009 report, examined energy productivity gains over the 1997–2006 period, and estimated that 39% of the improvement during this period was due to structural shifts in the economy and 61% was due to intensity improvements within each of 65 sectors he examined. This implies that energy efficiency improvements might have averaged about 1.2% per year (60% of the 2% per year discussed above).
Put another way, if energy intensity remained unchanged, in 2014 the United States would have used 195 quads. If we estimate that 40% of the improvement arose from structural change (rounding from Huntington’s 39%), energy use would have been 156 quads with structural change alone. Actual energy use was only 98 quads, leaving efficiency-related savings of about 58 quads.

Multiple benefits prove energy efficiency is a gift that keeps giving;"Energy efficiency improvements provide value over and above utility bill savings. ACEEE’s new report Recognizing the Value of Energy Efficiency’s Multiple Benefits describes the gains outside of energy savings created by energy efficiency improvements. Many of these benefits accrue to residential and business energy consumers. Additional benefits accrue in the form of cost reductions to the utility system, resulting in lower costs for all customers.
Multiple vs non-energy benefits
Earlier research by ACEEE (here, here, and here) and others succeeds in identifying multiple benefits, which vary in type and magnitude as they are realized by energy consumers in different economic sectors. What may begin as an energy efficiency measure may often also offer some combination of improved comfort or convenience, enhanced business productivity or quality, or savings in related maintenance or administrative costs. ACEEE has adopted the term multiple benefits as one that supersedes the traditional concept of “non-energy” benefits. The difference comes from recognizing the simultaneous savings of dissimilar energy forms—for instance, when an electricity improvement causes natural gas savings for the same facility. Multiple benefits therefore encompasses both energy and non-energy effects.
Multiple benefits information will appeal to consumers and providers of energy efficiency improvements as well as the policy and program administrators who guide energy resource programs. The challenge for all parties is to detect and evaluate these benefits. ACEEE’s report describes state-of-the-art approaches to recognizing multiple benefit values in the context of energy resource programs, and summarizes the range of values that have been estimated. Future work should build on the evaluation approaches demonstrated in Massachusetts, Maryland, and a few other states.
Measuring value for residential, business, and utilities sectors
In some instances, multiple benefits are the “icing on the cake” of energy savings. Yet sometimes, the causality is reversed: to the customer, energy savings may be secondary to the larger and more compelling value of other non-energy benefits. In the residential sector, enhanced health, comfort, and durability benefits from whole-home energy retrofits can surpass the value of energy savings. Studies describe single-family residential benefits valued anywhere from 50% to 300% of energy cost savings. In addition to occupant benefits, studies show multifamily building owners experience benefits ranging in value from 3% to 150% of energy savings. Multiple benefits may be the primary focus of promotions and incentives that ultimately encourage more investment in energy efficiency.
In the business sector, multiple benefits are as varied as the businesses themselves—compare, for example, the hotelier’s concern with guest comfort versus the precision tool manufacturer’s need to minimize material waste. Preliminary findings describe business sector multiple benefits ranging from 44% to 122% of energy savings. Suffice it to say, energy efficiency can be advanced not only on its own merit, but for the many valuable outcomes that it facilitates. Consumers, energy solution vendors, and energy resource administrators all find that some benefits are more tangible than others. Accordingly, the new report suggests tactics for segmenting and prioritizing these benefits for promotional and evaluation purposes.
Geotargeting, the practice of targeting program offerings to customers located near areas on the electric grid that are capacity constrained, is emerging as an approach for using energy efficiency as a distribution system resource that can cause the deferral or avoidance of transmission and distribution system investments. Other multiple benefits accruing to utility shareholders and ratepayers include the reduction of environmental compliance costs and reduced customer account arrearages. Overall, utility customers benefit in cost reductions caused by the promotion of strategically located customer end-use efficiencies.
Evolving research in multiple benefit values allows energy policy and program evaluators to adjust their goals and cost-benefit measures accordingly. Our latest report answers many questions, while revealing potential for the future refinement of the multiple benefits concept.

New energy efficiency legislation offers opportunity for the Golden State to up its game;"California has long been an energy efficiency leader, topping ACEEE’s State Energy Efficiency Scorecard from 2006–2010 and ranking #2 since then. But like many states, California would much prefer to be #1 and has been upping its game, achieving a “most improved” grade in our 2015 Scorecard and trailing the #1 state by only half a point.
California’s desire to be a leader is also exemplified by two pieces of recently enacted legislation. The first, SB 350, calls on the California Energy Commission (CEC), the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), and publicly owned utilities to work together to double cumulative energy efficiency savings achieved by 2030. The second, AB 802, promotes building benchmarking, enables access to whole building data for owners of commercial and multi-family buildings above a certain size, and also calls on the utilities and the CPUC to implement programs to improve the efficiency of existing buildings.
As a result of these bills, the CEC and CPUC will be holding proceedings to figure out the implementation details, as both bills provide only high-level direction. In our view, these proceedings can be an opportunity for California to streamline some of its procedures so that there is more focus on achieving goals and encouraging innovation, and less focus on process and micro-managing details. California has been much more particular than other states in trying to specifically attribute energy savings to specific actions and for assuming that all existing buildings will eventually meet the building code and therefore only savings beyond the building code count. There has also been a reluctance to count savings from improved building operations.
Unfortunately, the effect of these actions is that it reduces the ambitions of many existing programs and the ability to go after some significant savings opportunities. For example, existing buildings may be upgraded to code during major renovations, but it may be 50 years or more before a substantial majority of buildings are upgraded. In the meantime, large amounts of energy are being wasted.
The upcoming proceedings in California provide an opportunity to work past these issues, and enable California to tap into some additional savings that currently are out of reach. We have two high-level suggestions for California officials to consider:
1. Set strong goals and encourage cooperation without too much focus on attribution
California currently has substantial efficiency programs run by utilities, the state, local governments, local organizations, and regional consortia. Considerable effort is made to try to separate out the relative effects of these programs, giving utilities credit only for savings that can be specifically attributed to them. A better approach might be to set goals for the utilities based on the savings that can be documented for all of these programs, and thereby encourage the utilities to work closely with these other entities to achieve savings, rather than worrying about who gets credit for specific units of savings.
Evaluations should be conducted to determine savings according to new CPUC guidelines (discussed below), but there would no longer be a need to figure out how much credit goes to each program in the same market. If utility goals also include savings from non-utility programs and policies, their new goals should be higher than would be the case under the previous approach of basing utility goals on only customer-funded programs. These broader goals should be tied to the SB 350 goals. Qualitative process evaluations should still be conducted to get a sense of which specific efforts and services are making a substantial difference and which are not, so that programs can be refined and improved.
However, determining attribution is very difficult to do and subject to large bands of uncertainty and regulators should not spend significant state resources to determine attribution with statistical precision. Massachusetts and Rhode Island are now following this model of setting higher goals that include savings beyond just utility-run efforts and it has worked well. We have recommended a similar model in New York.
Furthermore, in setting goals, it is important to get cost-effectiveness rules right. California’s complicated rules place excessive constraints on what is cost-effective. For example, California uses a version of the total resources cost test (TRC) that considers all program-related and participant costs but only energy-saving benefits, largely ignoring the multiple benefits these measures achieve beyond saving energy. Either only utility costs and benefits should be counted (an approach called the program administrator cost test) or a full TRC test should be used that counts all benefits (my colleague Marty Kushler has written on this issue). If cost-effectiveness tests are overly strict, significant savings opportunities will be left on the table.
2. Replace the current baseline for existing buildings with a simple and fair system
Under AB 802, the CPUC is directed to find a new baseline for evaluating energy savings from existing residential and commercial buildings. Research in California has found that the majority of savings in existing buildings are to improve these buildings so they reach current code levels, and opportunities for beyond-code savings in existing buildings are less than 25% of the available cost-effective savings. AB 802 essentially endorses this finding and the CPUC will be deciding on new baselines. We recommend that they keep things simple but fair. For replacement of pieces of equipment, a “common practice baseline” approach can be used, as is used in the Northwest and has been proposed by EPA for evaluation of energy savings under the Clean Power Plan (others have called this a dynamic baseline).
For example, the common practice baseline for a measure could be defined to be the average efficiency of products in the market. For more complicated multi-measure retrofits, the existing building can be used as a baseline, and an adjustment factor developed from historic data to subtract savings from naturally occurring efficiency savings (or add additional savings if the baseline is increasing).
Of course, the real world is complicated and details will be important. For example, for early replacement of equipment, simple procedures should be established so that credit is given for savings relative to current equipment efficiency until the end of the average useful life of the current equipment and then a common practice baseline applied for subsequent savings. Likewise, for retrofits, estimates of naturally-occurring efficiency should not include historic savings from efficiency programs. California has recently established the California Technical Forum, a group of experts with technical and evaluation expertise. This would be an excellent place to work out these details.
What’s fair to all?
Ultimately, decisions in California (and other states) are made based on what’s fair and reasonable for all parties. In particular, regulators want to make sure costs to customers are fair. Removing some of the constraints on energy efficiency will reduce customer bills, as customer consumption goes down (due to efficiency) and costs of power are reduced because energy efficiency generally costs less per kWh than investing in new generation. Reducing the need for grid upgrades can also reduce costs.
In California, and many other states, utility shareholders receive incentives for achieving energy-saving targets. What we propose here are higher targets and more ways to achieve them. If these changes are made, shareholder incentives may need to be recalibrated so they provide a reasonable incentive for shareholders and a fair cost to customers. Experiences in other states can enlighten this process, building on what has worked well and avoiding what has not.
Conclusion
The new laws in California will spur efforts to take efficiency efforts to a higher level. They can also be an opportunity to clear out some of the brush and establish simple but fair procedures so that programs can focus on California’s goal: doubling energy savings. Ultimately we hope that California regulators will improve their processes, perhaps using these ideas or perhaps finding something even better as a result of the proceedings they are about to start.

Creating a trading space for researchers and innovators at the 2015 Intelligent Efficiency Conference;"Are you conducting research on the use of information and communications technologies (ICT) and data analytics to save energy? Or, have you just finished some research and are looking for a venue to report the results? Perhaps you just launched a new project, program, device, or service, and want to share it.
Or maybe you need data. Or you have data and think it may be of use to someone?
We want to hear from you!  More specifically, we want you to attend our 2015 Intelligent Efficiency Conference and tell other attendees.
A new feature of this year’s conference is our Trading Space session. It is a 90-minute session designed for researchers and innovators to give their elevator pitches. We’ve incorporated similar sessions into a couple of our other conferences to great effect: partnerships have been formed, collaborations initiated, deals closed.
Each participant in the Trading Space will have a least five minutes to explain who they are, what they’re working on, why someone should care, and what they need. We’re focused on researchers and innovators but welcome any registered attendee to participate. New start-ups are certainly welcome.
Since this is an ICT conference, we’re anticipating that some people will ask for data, others for algorithms. I’ve been told that sometimes data is more valuable than money. But you can ask for that too—there may be just the partner you need in our audience!
If you are interested, please submit your idea for a slot in the Trading Space session. Email your contact information and submit a description of your pitch in 50 words or fewer to industry@aceee.org. Please include “2015 ACEEE Intelligent Efficiency Conference – Trading Space” in the subject line of your email.
Just one note: You must be registered for the conference in order to have your topic accepted!

Yes, municipal utilities can compete with their investor-owned cousins on energy efficiency;"Utility energy efficiency policies and programs have seen tremendous growth over the past dozen years, and this progress has been widely cited by ACEEE and others. During this time, much attention has rightly been focused on investor-owned utilities, since they account for the majority of electricity sales in the nation.
However, over a quarter of all customers and a quarter of all electric sales in the United States are served by the public power sector. For the United States to achieve its economic and environmental objectives in the area of energy efficiency, public power utilities must be strong partners. Toward that end, our new report focuses on a key segment of the public power sector: municipal utilities.
Our findings indicate that it is definitely possible for municipal utilities to ”hold their own” against their investor-owned neighbors. Based on suggestions from industry experts, we identified and surveyed a total of 23 municipal utilities with substantial energy efficiency efforts and achievements. Overall, this group had an average annual energy efficiency spending of 2.44% of revenues, and an average annual savings of 1.0% of sales.
In the hope of inspiring additional municipal utilities to strive for strong energy efficiency achievements, the report profiles a total of nine of the highest-performing municipal utilities. For that group, the average annual spending on energy efficiency programs was 3.1% of revenues, and the average savings was 1.4% of sales. That is competitive with many of the best-performing investor-owned utilities in the nation.
Our study also gathered information on the major factors motivating municipal utilities to engage in substantial energy efficiency efforts. At the top of the list was the fact that their customers “like” having energy efficiency programs and services available from their utility. The other top factors were: the value of energy efficiency as a resource in reducing other supply costs, the corollary economic benefits to the community they serve, and whether their local governing board had a strong policy position on energy efficiency. State policies encouraging or requiring energy efficiency efforts by public power utilities were also rated as very important factors by municipal utilities located in states with such policies.
When asked about factors that tend to inhibit aggressive energy efficiency efforts, municipal respondents most often mentioned the concern over revenue loss. In that respect, municipal utilities share that concern with their IOU counterparts.
While there is much variability in the level of energy efficiency activity across the municipal utility sector, this study documents that there are many excellent examples around the nation of municipal utilities demonstrating strong energy efficiency achievements. We hope that by providing this information, we will enable more public power utilities increase their efforts in this area.

Breathe Easy. Energy efficiency improves health.;"Energy efficiency means using technology and best practices to produce the same or better levels of services, such as light, temperature control, or motor drive power, while using less energy. Or, to put it simply, it’s about reducing waste.
Lowering the amount of energy we waste reduces our need to burn coal and other fossil fuels to generate electricity. Those reductions in pollution mean big gains for health, as pollutants from fossil fuel combustion contribute to four of the leading causes of death in the United States: cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, heart disease, and stroke. These pollutants damage all the major organ systems in the body.
Fortunately, a reduction in our reliance on fossil fuels will allow dramatic improvements to human health. That means that energy efficiency benefits health.

New building codes study shares important lessons for research and evaluation;"A recent paper by Charles Withers and Robin Vieira from the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) presents a fascinating story about the impacts of the Florida new home building energy code. The paper was presented at the recent Behavior, Energy and Climate Change conference.
Withers and Vieira compared the energy use of a sample of homes built to the 2009 Florida code with the energy use of a sample of homes built to the code in effect during 1984–1985. Previous FSEC building energy simulations had compared the 1984 and 2009 energy codes and predicted energy savings of about 50% for combined heating, hot water, and cooling energy use. But when Withers and Vieira compared actual energy consumption of 1984 and 2009 homes for these end uses, they found only a 7–13% difference (varying depending on what specific data they used).
Given such data, less rigorous researchers might have concluded that the Florida building code was not working well. Fortunately, Withers and Vieira were very scrupulous and realized that to fully evaluate this code, they had to look at more than energy consumption data. They decided to dig deeper, collecting and comparing detailed data on the homes. They found a number of factors that helped explain the lower-than-expected energy savings:
In the old homes, much of the equipment (furnaces, air conditioners, water heaters, and appliances) had been replaced, and the new equipment was much more efficient than the requirements in the 1984 code. The authors attribute the changes to appliance efficiency standards, energy efficiency programs, education efforts, and higher energy prices.
The older homes had more attic insulation on average than was required by the 1984 code. (Withers and Vieira did not try to determine to what extent this extra insulation was added by the original homebuilder or by subsequent residents.)
Temperatures in the older homes averaged about 1 degree F higher during the summer and about 0.6 degrees colder during the winter. In other words, some of the new code's benefits were being taken in the form of slightly increased comfort.
A somewhat warmer-than-normal winter affected the data on actual energy use.
The newer homes had more miscellaneous energy loads (more gadgets).
Interestingly, code compliance was not a significant factor. The authors found a 90% compliance rate and estimated that the out-of-compliance items resulted in an annual impact on energy use of 1% or less.
The FSEC team then went back and reran the energy use simulations to compare the homes adjusting for these factors. The first factor (subsequent upgrades to appliances and equipment) was the most important, but, accounting for all the factors, the revised simulated energy use of the new homes was 9% lower than the older homes, about at the midpoint of the 7–13% difference they found in actual energy consumption data.
The authors conclude that “[the code] has made a significant difference, but measured savings compared to older homes 25 years after construction are decreased by years of home improvement efforts.”
In a previous blog post I described some of the errors made by a researcher in a study of the California building energy code. His mistakes included not looking at why his estimate of savings was less than predictions made many years earlier. Both the California evaluator and future researchers would do well to study Withers and Vieira's thorough and effective evaluation. Their paper also uncovered some important lessons about how codes, home improvements, and new home trends evolve in practice.

Lower savings than predicted? Try calibration;"Much attention has been recently focused on the gap between the predicted and actual energy savings achieved by residential energy retrofit projects and programs, including low-income weatherization programs and customer-funded programs such as Home Performance with ENERGY STAR®. The difference between pre-retrofit baseline energy use, post-retrofit predicted energy savings based on energy simulation models, and the actual post-retrofit energy savings as determined by billing analysis (i.e., the realization rate) has led some to question the validity of energy models and their use in retrofit programs. Some have even suggested that in light of the discrepancies between predicted and realized energy savings, we should throw out the models altogether.
Among efficiency practitioners, the limitations of simulation models aren’t news. Studies comparing the results of common residential energy simulation models with actual home energy use have shown discrepancies between estimated energy savings and realization rates, sometimes over-predicting and other times under-predicting savings. For example, some models have a tendency to overestimate baseline energy use and, as a result, overestimate the predicted savings from recommended retrofit measures. In response, there has been a concerted effort to develop tools and techniques to improve the accuracy of modeled predictions to ensure that individual customers and program administrators receive more accurate predictions of the energy savings they can expect from their home retrofit projects and programs.
One of the most effective techniques for improving accuracy is calibration of the model for a home with historical energy use data for the property through utility bills—essentially correcting the model to account for construction quality (“as built”) and the occupants. The Building Performance Institute (BPI) has developed a standard for energy model calibration, ANSI/BPI-2400 Standard Practice for Standardized Qualification of Whole-House Energy Savings Predictions by Calibration to Energy Use History . The standard defines a method for using pre-retrofit utility bills to bound predicted energy savings by calibrating the pre-retrofit baseline models with monthly utility bill data (or, if this data is not available, annual energy consumption by fuel) and then using the calibrated model to calculate energy savings. Standardized operating conditions for use in calculating predicted energy savings are provided.
In a study for NYSERDA, Performance Systems Development found that model calibration can significantly increase the accuracy of energy savings predictions and project-level realization rates (as illustrated by the figure below). Using ANSI/BPI-2400, the median realization rate for a set of projects in NYSERDA’s home performance program increased from 61% to 91%. Importantly, the analysis found that the difference was largely due to over-prediction of baseline energy use and thus in the absolute value of actual savings realized; the percent savings predicted by the models was very close to the actual percent savings. Furthermore, the study had valuable findings for contractor and program best practice: “the use of model calibration following the ANSI/BPI-2400 standard forces the user to address inaccuracies in the baseline energy model regardless of the level of detail entered about the project. Therefore, model calibration allows for reduced detail in the baseline models that undergo program review thereby reducing contractor effort and speeding up review time.” The National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) is working on automated calibration procedures for residential simulation models that could further simplify the process.
Energy Savings Predictions without (left) and with (right) Model Calibration
By improving the pre-retrofit (baseline) energy use model, calibration can improve the accuracy of predicted energy savings, or realization rate, expressed as the X/Y ratio. As the modeled baseline and predicted savings better match actual pre- and post-retrofit energy usage, realization rates increase.
Source: Performance Systems Development 2015
To date, the use of model calibration has been limited and is required by few, if any, residential retrofit programs. While calibration would require investment in training of contractors on calibration methods and in additional time for each project, the benefits are clear. To get started, programs should consider setting model calibration requirements for projects that exceed a certain cost or predicted savings threshold. For new contractors, programs could require calibration on a set number of initial jobs as a means for demonstrating modeling proficiency. Incentives could help offset the additional contractor time required for calibration; alternatively, calibration could unlock additional incentives, preferable financing terms, or other benefits.
With the potential to move realization rates above 90%, calibration represents a solid forward step to ensuring that predictions align with actual energy savings from home retrofits. Combined with other improvements in modeling procedures, it’s not too much to expect achieving average realization rates of 100% in the future.

How a bill signed by Bush and implemented by Obama is saving consumers billions;"Given President Obama’s focus on the climate and green jobs, it may be a surprise that much of what the Obama administration has done on those issues is implementing a bill that Congress passed with bipartisan support and President George W. Bush signed: the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). And it may be equally surprising that eight years later, parts of that bill still remain on the shelf.
Today, we are releasing a review of the implementation of EISA (one in an occasional series of reports looking back to see whether energy efficiency legislation actually worked). In fact, EISA’s effects have been remarkable. Vehicle fuel economy standards, equipment efficiency standards, major new efficiency programs, and federal energy management have helped change the trajectory of energy use in the United States.
The Projected Long-Term Impact of EISA Energy Efficiency Provisions
Save consumers over $2 trillion
Reduce oil use by almost 3 million barrels a day in 2030
Reduce total energy use by 8 quads (8%) in 2030
Cut cumulative CO2 emissions by 17 billion metric tons
I’ll note that those savings are 5-20 times the savings we projected in a recent paper for a set of ten provisions currently under consideration by Congress.
Key outcomes from EISA include the following:
Vehicle standards
EISA required the first major boost in vehicle fuel economy standards since they were created three decades earlier. For cars and light trucks, it directed an increase from about 25 miles per gallon to 35 mpg in 2020. But the administration leveraged authority in EISA with federal support for the automakers in crisis, and with pressure from California regulators, to go well beyond the EISA minimum, to 45 mpg in 2025. (Note that on-road mpg figures are about 20% lower than these numbers, which are used for standards.) As directed in EISA, the administration also set the first standards for heavier trucks and buses in 2011, again with broad support, and is working on the second round.
Equipment and lighting standards
Even though political opposition has suspended federal enforcement of it, the light bulb standard continues to promote new technology options, like LEDs, that are saving consumers billions of dollars. The Department of Energy also has ramped up an unprecedented series of other standards and test procedures with major energy savings. We project that standards from EISA will save consumers over $200 billion.
Efficiency programs
The Recovery Act and other stimulus legislation unexpectedly poured billions of dollars into programs authorized by EISA for state and local governments, the auto industry, utilities, and others. Some other programs, however, have yet to save energy because they have not yet been funded.
Housing policies
Although model building energy codes have been updated to achieve large energy savings, long delays have slowed their application, under EISA, to manufactured housing and new homes with federal assistance such as FHA loans.
Thus, a number of actions under EISA remain for the last year of the administration. Some of the most important pending actions (and the responsible agencies) are:
Heavy-duty vehicle standard update (DOT and EPA)
Multiple new and updated appliance efficiency standards and test procedures (DOE)
Manufactured housing efficiency standard (DOE)
Update to efficiency requirement for federally assisted housing (HUD and USDA)
Work toward efficiency labels for tires and electronics (DOT and FTC)
Assuming these actions are completed, the figure below shows the growth in energy savings over time that we project from the provisions.
The savings have not come easily. The implementation of the bill has been marked by the Great Recession, the election of President Obama in 2008, and subsequent stimulus legislation and political backlash. It has shown the difficulty of interpreting broad legislation, the pitfalls of political shifts, and the slow pace of agencies’ deliberative processes. But it has also shown that bipartisan legislation, a committed administration, and stakeholder support can make a real difference. This collaboration has saved consumers billions of dollars, reduced our dependence on oil, and improved the environment.
We hope that the Obama administration will complete the rest of the to-do list, and that the current Congress will take up the baton and hand a strong efficiency agenda to the next president.

7 ways to convince your state to make the most of the Clean Power Plan;"Now that the final Clean Power Plan has been released and posted in the Federal Register, it’s time to get to work. By including energy efficiency in their compliance plans, states can reduce emissions and compliance costs while boosting local economies and reducing household utility bills. Many states are already benefiting from energy efficiency policies and programs, while others are just getting started. Regardless of the past, it is now up to people in states to ensure that their state officials plan for a future where these benefits can be achieved. Here are some ideas for how to get involved.
The clock is ticking for states to plan for compliance, with initial plan submissions due to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by September 2016. Here’s how energy efficiency stakeholders can get involved in the planning process:
Identify the state agency responsible for implementing the state compliance plan. The state official responsible for developing clean air regulations is a good place to start. The office will typically be housed within the department of environment or health. Visit the National Association of Clean Air Agencies’ website to find the contact information for your state’s air agency.
Request information about upcoming public hearings, state comment submissions, or meetings taking place in your state. Several states, like Pennsylvania and Virginia, have already held public meetings to discuss state compliance options, while other states are in the process of planning stakeholder engagement. Information regarding upcoming stakeholder meetings can typically be found on the website of your state’s air office or energy office.
Contact your governor and legislators to inform them of key energy efficiency opportunities in your state. This dialog can include education on ramping up existing programs and policies as well as new opportunities that can be implemented. Get a snapshot of your state’s energy efficiency landscape here. You can quickly get an idea for the magnitude of new opportunities with this tool.
Make sure your state plan reflects the diversity of its residents, houses, and businesses by engaging with your state and EPA. The final rule sets expectations for states to engage with vulnerable communities as they develop their plans so that the effects on those communities are considered as plans are designed. In the coming months, EPA will also be engaging stakeholders regarding the definition of low-income communities and the types of energy efficiency programs allowed under the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP), which grants some emissions allowances or credits for early action to reduce energy use in low-income communities.
Reach out to other groups that will be affected by the planning process. Share information and consolidate efforts where possible to ensure that everyone has a seat at the planning table, including organizations with interests in labor, faith, and environmental justice, in addition to energy and environmental groups. Many communities are affected by this planning, including vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and the economically disadvantaged. See many of the ideas proposed for the affordable housing community here.
Be a resource for your state officials developing the compliance plan. There are a number of resources available to help states get answers to tough questions. Visit ACEEE’s 111(d) page and our joint NASEO-ACEEE State Clean Power Plan Resource Hub for tools and templates that help states include energy efficiency in their compliance plans. These resources will continue to be updated to meet the needs of state officials.
Talk to EPA. These are six ways advocates can influence state compliance plans, but another route is to submit comments to EPA. Along with the final rule, EPA released drafts of a federal plan and model rules for states and guidance on measuring and verifying the impacts of energy efficiency. There are several areas within these documents that EPA is specifically seeking comment by energy efficiency stakeholders, including the treatment of energy efficiency in state plans and any federally imposed plans, as well as the CEIP. The deadline for both of these comment periods is January 21, 2016. Comments can be submitted here for the federal plan and model rules (Docket ID No. EPA–HQ– OAR–2015–0199), and here for the EM&V guidance.
ACEEE will continue to provide assistance to state planners and advocates in the coming year. We will also submit comments to EPA on the treatment of energy efficiency in their proposed model plans and guidance.

ACEEE State Scorecard: Massachusetts Edges Out California as Most Energy-Efficient State, Maryland Among Most Improved;"Top 10 States Ranked in Energy Efficiency Scorecard: MA, CA, VT, RI, OR, CT, MD, WA, NY … With MN and IL Tied for 10th; Five Most Improved States: MD, IL, DC, CA, and TX; and Five States in Most Need of Improvement: MS, LA, SD, WY, and ND.
Washington, DC—Energy efficiency measures continue to flourish in states across the country, with several states—including California, Maryland, Illinois, Texas and the nation’s capital, Washington, DC—taking major steps that improved their scores in the ninth annual edition of the State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). The State Scorecard ranking of the states is issued annually with the support of the US Department of Energy. This year, DOE Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency Kathleen Hogan participated in the release of the ACEEE report.
Available online at http://aceee.org/state-policy/scorecard, the following are key findings of the 2015 State Scorecard:
The top 10 states for energy efficiency are Massachusetts, California, Vermont, Rhode Island, Oregon, Connecticut, Maryland, Washington, and New York, with Minnesota and Illinois tied for 10th place. Massachusetts retains the top spot for the fifth consecutive year based on a strong commitment to energy efficiency under its Green Communities Act. In California, requirements for reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, major efforts to achieve energy efficiency in schools, and implementation of a cap-and-trade program earned the state several more points this year, putting it only a half-point behind Massachusetts in the state rankings.
A solid 20 states rose in the State Scorecard rankings. California, a leading state, is also one of the most improved states this year. Maryland, Illinois, the District of Columbia, and Texas also deserve recognition for improvement over the past year. Maryland increased its commitment to energy efficiency in 2015 by establishing new, more aggressive energy savings targets for utilities. Illinois is one of the first states to adopt the newest building energy codes, and has increased the amount of energy efficiency available to utilities through procurement agreements with the Illinois Power Agency. Like Illinois, Texas has been aggressive in adopting the latest building energy codes, and has also taken notable actions to ensure code compliance across the state. The District of Columbia is among the most improved for the second year in a row, due to its progress across a number of policy areas and the ramping up of DC Sustainable Energy Utility programs.
Overall, 16 states fell in the rankings this year, due to such factors as policy or program rollbacks or failure to keep pace as other states expanded efficiency efforts. The five states most in need of improvement (starting with dead last) are: North Dakota, Wyoming, South Dakota, Louisiana, and Mississippi, although new efficiency programs in Louisiana and Mississippi mean these states may not be in the bottom for much longer. While not in the bottom five states, New Mexico dropped the farthest in 2015, losing four points and falling six positions from 25th to 31st in the rankings. This is due in part to the state’s failure to adopt energy building codes beyond the 2009 requirements. Many of the states falling behind are not increasing energy savings year after year, and are therefore being outpaced as other states ramp up programs to meet higher savings targets.
ACEEE executive director Steve Nadel said: “As states move to frame their plans under the federal Clean Power Plan, this year marks a tipping point for energy efficiency. State policies are increasingly encouraging utilities to invest in cost-effective efficiency, prompting them to adopt new business models that align their interests with those of customers and policymakers. We can see this taking hold in the 20 states that improved their Scorecard rank in 2015. Utilities across the United States invested more than $7 billion in energy efficiency over the past year alone.”
Annie Gilleo, ACEEE state policy manager and lead author of the State Scorecard said: “ Governors, legislators, regulators, and citizens are increasingly recognizing that energy efficiency is a crucially important state resource. As a result, many innovative policies and programs that promote energy efficiency originate at the state level. The State Scorecard reflects these successes through a comprehensive analysis of state efforts to support energy efficiency.”
Charlie Baker, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: “Energy efficiency is the most cost effective, accessible way for Massachusetts to meet our clean energy goals and help ratepayers manage their energy costs. Being recognized for the fifth consecutive year by ACEEE as the nation’s leader in energy efficiency underlines the commitment Massachusetts has made to pursue a diversified energy portfolio and my administration is seeking more, renewable energy sources like hydro power to continue this important effort.”
Clifford Rechtschaffen, senior advisor on climate, energy and environmental issues, Office of California Governor Jerry Brown, State of California said: “This year Governor Brown called for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 by 2030 to deal with the threat of climate change. To help achieve this ambitious goal, the governor called for doubling the rate of efficiency savings over the next 15 years-- on top of the huge energy savings that California has accomplished over the past 40 years. We look forward to ACEEE tracking our progress towards achievement of that goal in upcoming State Scorecards.”
Other Key Findings
The State Scorecard assesses state policies and programs that improve energy efficiency in our homes, businesses, industries, and transportation systems. It considers the six policy areas in which states typically pursue energy efficiency: utility and public benefits, transportation, building energy codes and compliance, combined heat and power (CHP), state government–led initiatives around energy efficiency, and appliance and equipment standards.
Additional topline findings include:
Savings from electricity efficiency programs in 2014 totaled approximately 25.7million megawatt-hours (MWh), a 5.8% increase over last year. These savings are equivalent to about 0.7% of total retail electricity sales across the nation in 2014. Gas savings for 2014 were reported at 374 million therms (MMTherms), a 35% increase over 2013.
The leading states in utility-sector energy efficiency programs and policies in 2015 are Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont. These are the same three states that topped this category in 2014. With long records of success, all three continued to raise the bar on cost-effective programs and policies.
California, Massachusetts, and New York led the way in energy-efficient transportation policies. Massachusetts promoted smart growth development in cities and municipalities through state-delivered financial incentives. New York is one of the few states in the nation to have a vehicle-miles-traveled reduction target.
The leading states in building energy codes and compliance in 2015 are California and Illinois. Only four states, California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Maryland have adopted the latest commercial and residential building energy codes without significant weakening amendments.
Massachusetts, Maryland, and California were the highest ranked for combined heat and power policies.
California, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York led the way in state government initiatives.
Methodology
As in past years, the ninth edition of the State Scorecard ranks states on their policy and program efforts, not only assessing performance but also documenting best practices and recognizing leadership. The State Scorecard provides an annual benchmark of the progress of state energy efficiency policies and programs. It encourages states to continue strengthening their commitment to efficiency, thereby promoting economic growth and environmental benefits.

Air regulators, state energy officials, and the affordable housing community are working together. Here’s why.;"EPA’s recently released Clean Power Plan (CPP) requires states to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants. How states meet their targets will vary, as they are able to choose from a variety of compliance approaches. Many states, however, are well positioned to incorporate energy efficiency into their compliance plans. It’s proven to be a least-cost strategy for utilities, and provides multiple benefits for the customers they serve.
Targeting energy efficiency investments in affordable multifamily buildings is one strategy states can adopt. In addition to reductions in energy use and carbon, energy efficiency also lowers household energy bills and improves indoor air quality and health. These qualities make it a win-win for states and their residents.
The CPP offers a unique opportunity for multi-stakeholder coordination around energy efficiency in multifamily affordable housing. Residents and building owners in low-income communities will benefit from state compliance plans that include increased resources and financing for energy efficiency programs that serve this sector. In addition, participation in the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP), a voluntary early action program, will award states extra credit toward compliance for implementing energy efficiency programs in low-income communities.
In many states, air regulators and state energy officials will be leading the planning process with considerable opportunities for public input. This provides an opportunity for those state officials and the affordable housing community to come together to ensure that energy efficiency in multifamily affordable housing is an element of their state’s compliance plan.
For more information on the opportunities for energy efficiency in affordable housing under the CPP, see Energy Efficiency for All’s Clean Power Plan brief and join us for a webinar on October 15th. The webinar, Opportunities for affordable housing and energy efficiency in the Clean Power Plan, will provide an overview of the final rule, a discussion of what the Clean Power Plan means for housing stakeholders, and a review of how to engage in your state's planning process.

2015 Intelligent Efficiency Conference: looking beyond the energy efficiency horizon;"Intelligent efficiency, a suite of new technologies and approaches, is taking us to a place we have long sought: a future where energy use is optimized automatically. It’s already changing how buildings are managed, organizations are evaluated, and policies are implemented. The disruption is comprehensive across all sectors, but so are the opportunities.
So, if you are seeking insights from people with a view to the future, I invite you to attend our 2015 Intelligent Efficiency Conference. This will be our second Intelligent Efficiency Conference, and it will be held in Boston, December 6-8 at the Westin Waterfront. We are very excited with the agenda we’ve assembled and the speakers recruited. This year’s event will feature experts and thought leaders from the information and communication technology, energy efficiency, utility, building management, and smart city sectors. They will address how intelligent efficiency is going to change the design, management, and evaluation of buildings, communities, and efficiency programs. We will discuss the policy implications of these emergent technologies as well as examine how they can be used in environmental compliance efforts. There will be sessions on customer engagement, program design, and program evaluation, measurement, and verification.
If you’d like to learn more about this conference and intelligent efficiency in general, we are hosting a webinar on October 22nd at 1 pm (EDT). [Edit: The webinar has passed. Click the button below for video.] In the webinar, we will provide an overview of intelligent efficiency and explain how Boston has become a leader in using intelligent efficiency to improve city management and provide new services. These smart-city practices are one of the reasons Boston scored #1 in our 2015 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard, and why we chose the city for the conference.
Our webinar panel is comprised of:
Penni McLean-Conner, Chief Customer Officer and Senior Vice President of Customer Group for Eversource Energy (and ACEEE Board Member)

Smart thermostat initiatives reveal exciting new horizons for energy efficiency programs;"Today, Commonwealth Edison, several smart thermostat manufacturers, and the Environmental Law and Policy Center announced a major new initiative with a target to install one million smart thermostats in the homes of Commonwealth Edison customers over five years. Commonwealth Edison (commonly called ComEd) serves northern Illinois, including the Chicago metropolitan area. To start, the new smart thermostats will include the Nest and ecobee3, but over time additional manufacturers will be added.
Smart thermostats learn or understand a household’s patterns and adjust heating and cooling according to when a home is occupied or is about to be occupied, reducing heating and cooling when nobody is home for significant periods of time. Smart thermostats can also be used to reduce energy use during periods of time when power is most in demand; many utilities, including ComEd, provide financial incentives for such power-use reductions.
Smart thermostats are one of 18 relatively new energy efficiency measures profiled in a recent ACEEE report entitled New Horizons for Energy Efficiency. In that report, ACEEE reviewed half a dozen recent studies on energy savings from smart thermostats, finding that such thermostats can reduce energy use for home heating and cooling by an average of about 8–15% (as further studies come out, we plan to revise this estimate). The study estimates that such thermostats can provide electricity savings for 2-3 cents per kWh saved, and that overall they can reduce total US electricity use across all sectors by about ½%.
As announced today, ComEd will be promoting smart thermostats through rebates (typically $100 per thermostat plus an additional $20 from gas utilities), trade-ally training, consumer marketing, and direct installation as part of an existing ComEd program. Three distribution channels will be used this year: retail sales (both in stores and on-line), with the purchaser installing the thermostat; (2) sale and installation by a network of heating and cooling contractors; and (3) sale and installation as part of an existing home energy assessment program. Based on initial results, program offerings will be refined in future years.
ComEd is not the only utility to embrace smart thermostats. For example, NV Energy, serving most of Nevada, offers a free smart thermostat, including installation, through its mPower Home Energy Management program. The program includes energy management software and an online portal where customers can set operating schedules and other parameters, and can see how they are doing. The program also includes a demand-reduction component for peak days where the utility employs a pre-cooling algorithm before peak events and then raises the temperature set-point for a short period during the event. Customers can override thermostat settings during these peak events but they have found that few customers do so. Reliant Energy (a competitive retail electricity provider serving customers throughout Texas) has been providing Nest thermostats to customers who sign on to their Learn and Conserve program, a program that includes a two-year contract with fixed rates. Reliant also offers two other programs to promote Nest thermostats: a $25 rebate for customers who purchase them, and a program that offers bill credits to customers who allow the thermostat to reduce energy use during peak hours. And Austin Energy, serving Austin, Texas and vicinity, offers an $85 rebate for Internet-connected thermostats (some of which are smart thermostats) through its Power Partner program.
In coming months we will profile developments for some of the other new measures profiled in our New Horizons for Energy Efficiency report.

The many ways energy efficiency can boost your community’s resilience;"Making sure cities are resilient to a broad array of challenges has become a core concern for anyone involved in urban planning. Hurricane Katrina’s devastation on the Gulf Coast, and, more recently, Hurricane Sandy's effects on the East Coast showed us that preparing for the future can have consequential impacts on people’s lives and communities as a whole. Both storms provided tangible examples of extreme weather’s danger, but cities and towns also face diverse challenges ranging from aging infrastructure in need of repair to the everyday social vulnerability of the disadvantaged.
Energy concerns are also a vital component of the community resilience equation because energy literally powers our communities, making modern life possible. Energy efficiency is an ideal component of any resilience strategy because it aids emergency response and recovery, helps with climate change adaptation and mitigation, and provides social and economic benefits. In our latest report, Enhancing Community Resilience Through Energy Efficiency, we discuss energy efficiency measures and their resilience benefits, and how efficiency can be integrated into resilience planning.
Take the example of energy-efficient buildings from our infographic below. If an emergency causes a power outage or heating fuel disruption, high-performance buildings can maintain their temperatures so residents may be able to shelter in place, as long as buildings’ structural integrity is maintained. This is particularly important for vulnerable populations sensitive to temperature changes, like those with medical conditions or the elderly. And, even when there is no emergency, buildings that are energy-efficient waste less energy, which generally translates to lower and less volatile energy bills for households. More stable billing means families can prepare better for the future, and it frees up disposable income that can be invested in other needs. Energy-efficient buildings also use less power, which translates to fewer greenhouse gases emissions, an important consideration to many local policymakers attempting to mitigate climate change. (For another example of energy efficiency and resilience, check out our 2012 blog post about how combined heat and power was deployed during Hurricane Sandy.)
Good resilience planning uses cross-cutting solutions to address diverse community needs, helping residents prepare for the varied threats that may come their way. Energy efficiency can be a core strategy for not only tackling these threats but also creating more prosperous communities.

Phase 2 proposal drives truck fuel efficiency forward, but engine standards need a boost;"New fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles and engines, proposed this summer, have just run the gauntlet of public comment on their way to final adoption next year. As proposed, these Phase 2 standards would provide major gains in fuel efficiency for heavy-duty vehicles by 2027. The Phase 2 program will build on the success of the Phase 1 program adopted in 2011, and will help consolidate US manufacturing leadership in several advanced truck technologies in a global market. The Phase 2 program also offers the potential of new jobs in the design and production of these advanced vehicle technologies.
ACEEE, in its written comments submitted to the docket, applauds the agencies’ excellent work in developing the Phase 2 proposal. Phase 2 would improve upon the Phase 1 program in several fundamental ways, including:
a certification approach that better reflects the benefits of integrating engine, transmission, and vehicle improvements,
further vehicle segmentation and more realistic duty cycles to better capture technologies’ real-world benefits, and
the addition of trailers to the program (the current standards only apply to the tractor portion of tractor-trailers).
Facilitated by these advances in the program, the proposed Phase 2 standards would bring 20% and 24% further reductions in new vehicles’ fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 2024 and 2027, respectively.
Yet, there are a few missed opportunities in the current Phase 2 proposal. It should be strengthened in several areas to capture more of the available fuel savings. Greater reductions can be achieved, especially in the engines used for tractor trucks and vocational vehicles, even without accelerating or increasing reliance on advanced engine technologies such as waste heat recovery. Incremental improvements to engine, transmission, and vehicle, combined with the advanced technology adoption assumed by the agencies, can achieve 26% and 31% reductions in overall fuel consumption in 2024 and 2027, respectively, substantially more than the agencies’ proposed 24% reduction in 2027.
Given concerns that have been raised about the cost, performance and/or durability of some advanced technologies, it is worth noting that the standards proposed for 2027 could be achieved in 2024 without any adoption of waste heat recovery, advanced aerodynamics for tractors and trailers, advanced tires, start/stop systems, or hybridization.
At the same time, nudging technologies into the market is one of the main functions of efficiency standards to begin with. So standards that can be met for the foreseeable future with off-the-shelf technologies are missing a key element. Therefore, particularly if the program is extended to 2027, it is necessary to substantially strengthen the standards. That’s the only way to ensure that Phase 2 points the way to the heavy-duty truck and truck industry of the future.

Ohio study committee gets it wrong on energy efficiency targets;"On Wednesday, a group of Ohio policymakers released their recommendations to indefinitely freeze the state's clean energy and energy efficiency targets. Their misinformed recommendations, if implemented, would once again deliver a major setback to Ohio energy bill payers and the state's clean energy economy.
A cost-benefit analysis that ignores the benefits
The group, the Energy Mandates Study Committee—a special committee created in SB 310 to specifically examine cost-benefits of the energy efficiency resource standard (and renewable portfolio standard)—gets several things wrong about energy efficiency. First, while the committee’s initial task was to complete a cost-benefit analysis, the study includes absolutely no analysis of the benefits from investments in energy efficiency. They only look at the costs. ACEEE examined the benefits of energy efficiency in Ohio back in 2012, and found that continuing Ohio’s efficiency targets could save customers almost $5.6 billion in avoided energy expenditures, reduced wholesale energy prices, and capacity prices. And utilities in Ohio have extensively analyzed the costs and benefits of energy efficiency. By not basing their recommendations on an actual cost-benefit analysis of energy efficiency, the committee's study is shockingly incomplete.
Incentives alone are not enough to achieve high savings for Ohio
Ironically, the committee seems to recognize the value of efficiency, stating in their report that ""the Study Committee does see great value in continuing with energy efficiency so that Ohio ratepayers will pay less for electricity and the state will use less electricity overall."" But the committee then goes on to recommend voluntary programs and energy incentives for utilities to invest in efficiency instead of targets. Again, the committee fails to look at the evidence in developing their recommendation.
Yes, energy efficiency performance incentives for utilities are an effective tool if structured well (as we recently examined in ACEEE’s Beyond Carrots for Utilities report). However, the tools by themselves have been far less successful than specific energy efficiency targets at driving high levels of efficiency, as I wrote in a paper earlier this year, Policies Matter: Creating an Energy-Efficient Utility of the Future.
Utility energy efficiency performance incentives deliver the most savings for energy-bill payers when aligned with long-term, concrete targets, such as those in the original Ohio legislation. Without the targets, customers are vulnerable to large swings in program offerings and the resulting benefits, and the business community faces uncertainty in the state's commitment to invest in energy efficiency.
The results from voluntary programs in other states have not been promising. In 2014, all of the top 18 electricity-saving states in ACEEE’s State Energy Efficiency Scorecard had mandatory savings targets in place (including Ohio). Meanwhile, states with voluntary standards ranked much lower in terms of electricity savings­­­—for example, Missouri (33rd), Kentucky (34th), Tennessee (36th), and Virginia (47th). The trend of top savings occurring only in states with mandatory goals has generally held true for at least the past five years.
Emerging technologies are creating huge potential for energy savings targets
The energy efficiency targets in Ohio's original legislation are achievable and cost-effective, as we examined this summer in an analysis on energy efficiency potential in Ohio. We reviewed energy efficiency potential studies by the four investor-owned utilities (IOUs) in the state, which showed that the utilities were already planning on significant, cost-effective energy savings from efficiency programs. While the utility studies identified large amounts of untapped energy potential in the state through the next 10–20 years, they often underestimated the full efficiency potential in certain areas. For example, several emerging technologies and best practice strategies to encourage customer participation can yield significant additional energy savings, but were not fully considered in the studies. A recent ACEEE analysis further examines those emerging technologies and strategies in more depth, finding that 18 measures alone—including reduction of plug loads, conservation voltage reduction, and smart manufacturing— could collectively save up to 31% of total projected electricity use in the year 2030 .
The committee's recommendations are now in the hands of the Ohio General Assembly, which will decide whether to take them up in legislation. We hope they consider the evidence and the facts in their decisions—that energy efficiency delivers, and that policies matter. Setting concrete utility targets is the still best way to deliver energy and costs savings for Ohio customers.

4 energy efficiency trends to look for in the new DOE Quadrennial Technology Review;"Recently, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the White House Office of Science and Technology released the second Quadrennial Technology Review, or QTR. The 489 page tome bears resemblance to many other government reports that are too often relegated to the TL;DR file—too long; didn’t read. That would be unfortunate for those of us who care about the future of energy efficiency technologies.
The report contains a wealth of numbers about energy use and the technologies that can affect the future of energy efficiency in the US economy, and it presents four trends:
Convergence. All sectors of the economy are becoming increasingly interdependent.
Diversification. Energy sectors are shifting to diversified, distributed resources—a trend that ACEEE has been seeing in state and local energy planning.
Confluence. Computing power and simulation are ushering in a new era of “systems by design,” much the same as the concept of intelligent efficiency that ACEEE has been advancing.
Efficiency everywhere. Energy efficiency is a critical element in achieving national energy security, cost, and environmental goals—a theme that is at the core of our Energy Efficiency as a Resource Conference that took place last week in Little Rock.
The report highlights the role of energy technology in all parts of the energy production and consumption chain, including energy supply, buildings, manufacturing, and transportation and vehicles, with an emphasis on the shift from component performance to optimization of systems. Importantly, the QTR provides a roadmap for research, development, demonstration, and deployment of energy technologies. Secretary Moniz and Undersecretary Franklin Orr both indicated that DOE intends to use this report to guide its research efforts in the coming years.
While it may not be something everyone wants to read cover to cover, I recommend it to researchers as an important guide for future directions on energy efficiency technology. In particular, Chapter 5 focuses on building systems with an emphasis on smart buildings, an increasingly important element of the intelligent efficiency space, and Chapter 8 focuses on transport and vehicle systems and technologies.
Chapter 6 focuses on smart manufacturing, the topic of a recent ACEEE report. We are already seeing the roadmap aspect of this document reflected in the recent DOE solicitation for an innovation institute for smart manufacturing. We look forward to other announcements from DOE on activities that are set forth in this roadmap.

True, energy efficiency investment creates jobs. But how many?;"Even when the economy is doing well, economic growth and job creation always seem to be at the center of focus for policymakers at every level of government. So it’s only natural that when energy efficiency policies and programs are being discussed one of the questions that often comes is how will proposed initiatives affect jobs.
The good news is that job creation is one of the many benefits that results from smart investments in energy efficiency. We at ACEEE have conducted several studies that demonstrate this point. In our new report Verifying Energy Efficiency Job Creation: Current Practices and Recommendations, we took a look at efforts to quantify job creation from energy efficiency projects to see how they are being done and to try to establish some best practices to help people in the field tackle the problem.
When efficiency projects and programs are sold at least in part on their ability to create jobs, it’s only natural that people would want to know after the fact whether they lived up to their promise, but accurately quantifying the job creation impacts can be hard. The problem is that of all the different ways efficiency creates jobs, only a relatively small fraction are actually observable.
How energy efficiency creates jobs
Efficiency investments create jobs in at least two different ways. One is during the implementation of the project itself, like installing a new water heater in a home. The other is when the homeowners re-spend the money the new water heater saves them. Every job created through these two channels falls into one of three categories. “Direct” jobs are created from the initial change in spending patterns. “Indirect” jobs are created one step removed, along the supply chain. “Induced” jobs are created yet one more step further away when the people hired to fill the first two types of jobs take their new income and spend it on rent, groceries, going to the movies, or whatever.
In our water-heater replacement example, the implementation phase direct jobs are the water heater installers, the indirect jobs include things like workers at the water heater factory, and induced jobs are created when the installers and factory workers use new income to go out to dinner. The savings phase creates jobs in the same three categories. When the homeowner uses the money he or she saves on energy bills to buy a book, direct jobs are created at the book store, indirect jobs are created at the publisher, and induced jobs are created when employees at the bookstore and publishing company go out to dinner.
So we have two channels of job creation each creating three categories of jobs, and of those six possibilities, only one is generally observable: the direct jobs created in the implementation phase. It’s easy to point at workers putting new water heaters in buildings and identifying those jobs as part of the benefits of the efficiency investment, and sometimes it might be possible to go to the water heater factory and see new hires (or extended work hours) brought on to make those extra heaters, but when it comes to finding a server hired because the installers went out to dinner or tracking any of the impacts that occurred because the homeowner had more money to spend on books, putting a face to the people who got hired or worked more hours is almost impossible.
How jobs are counted
Despite this difficulty, policymakers, politicians, and other stakeholders still want to know how many jobs an efficiency policy or program created. Efficiency implementers do their best to respond to this demand by the people who control their destiny.
As you might expect with the complexity of this challenge, we found a wide range of approaches to addressing the problem and an equally wide range of results. Some assessments use “bottom-up” approaches that rely on head counts or surveys, some rely on “top-down” methods typically employing economic models, and a good number use both. Assessments differ in what kinds of jobs they count and how they report them, and we found that different assessments use different definitions for key terms. It seems clear to us that each one of the assessments we looked at represents a solid effort at addressing a difficult analytical problem, but that taken as a whole, the variation in what is done and how it’s done makes clear apples-to-apples comparisons very difficult.
Tackling job-counting issues
In response to this variety of methods and results, the report outlines an approach that we hope is clear, straightforward, and tractable to produce accurate ex-post evaluations that will help program administrators and policymakers make good decisions about how to invest resources. We recommend starting with the jobs that can be directly counted and using simple economic modeling tools and program data to build out a comprehensive estimate. We try to add clarity around the definitions like the direct, indirect, and induced jobs described above, and we highlight a number of tricky issues that evaluators should be aware of when conducting analyses. In the report, we highlight best practices around issues like accounting for negative job impacts that result from reduced energy demand, how to treat the costs of program implementation, and how to create tools that will produce reliable estimates of unobservable job creation impacts.
Our aim in the paper is less to establish a uniform methodology that all assessments should follow than it is to highlight some of the more important issues that often arise, and to provide a framework for evaluators to address them. We hope that our proposed approach will lend credibility to the job creation potential of energy efficiency investments, and that other industries will conduct comparable analyses with similar transparency and rigor.

The next generation of energy efficiency programs could save 22% of electricity use in 2030;"Energy efficiency has come a long way. From its roots in the energy crises of the 1970s, it has grown and evolved to become an integral part of our energy landscape. Examples of energy efficiency advances are ubiquitous and often invisible. We see the results of such advances in the slow growth of electricity demand in recent years. Our homes, offices, businesses, and factories continue to become more energy efficient due to innovation in technologies and applications. Rooting out energy waste has spawned new ways of examining and managing how we use energy.
While energy efficiency has done much to improve our economy and environment, we want it to do more. Most states have policies and programs in place that seek to achieve even higher energy savings. A number of national efforts similarly aim to increase energy efficiency to achieve economic and environmental benefits. A clear example is the EPA Clean Power Plan, which seeks to achieve significant reductions in carbon emissions. Energy efficiency can play a major role in achieving emissions reductions under the plan.
After all this success with energy efficiency, what’s left? Have we reached the limit of how much energy efficiency we can squeeze out of our economy? This is a particularly vexing question for utilities and organizations that run efficiency programs for utility customers, and this is the subject of ACEEE's latest report, released today. While we're achieving higher overall savings from energy efficiency than ever before, a variety of factors are limiting the amount of such savings that efficiency programs can harvest:
Building energy codes have become more stringent—requiring higher energy efficiency for new construction and major renovations.
Appliance and equipment standards have increased.
The number of customers who haven’t participated in relevant energy efficiency programs has diminished due to the success of some programs serving large numbers of customers.
The icon of energy efficiency—the compact fluorescent lightbulb (CFL)—has been the workhorse of efficiency program portfolios. This single technology has delivered large shares of energy savings for program administrators. However, with recent federal lighting standards in place, programs can no longer rely on CFLs to deliver such large savings. The recent standards raise the baseline against which savings are measured, thus reducing the savings that can be attributed to energy efficiency programs.
A team of ACEEE researchers examined the fundamental question, “What are the next large savings opportunities for energy efficiency?” The resulting research is described in the major report released today. The research objective was to identify a set of energy efficiency measures that are capable of delivering substantial energy savings by the year 2030. We use the term “measure” broadly—it includes individual end-use measures, system improvements, and even entire buildings or programs. We define substantial savings as at least 1% of total annual electricity sales in 2030 from the cumulative impact of each of the measures or programs from 2015 to 2030.
We identified a large set of measures that spanned the spectrum of residential, commercial, and industrial uses of electricity, and then we screened them based on our estimates of savings possible by 2030. The result was a set of 18 measures that we estimate collectively could save 22% of total projected electricity use in the year 2030. We bounded this mid-range estimate with a high case of 31% and low case of 15%. While this is not a comprehensive analysis of all energy-savings measures and programs, it represents a large share of the electricity savings potential. The top five measures are:
Large reductions in key targeted plug loads
Conservation voltage reduction
New construction programs
Comprehensive commercial building retrofits
Smart manufacturing
Our analysis clearly shows that the well of energy savings from energy efficiency is not running dry. Instead, it is being replenished through advances in technologies and practices, system optimization, and behavioral approaches. While our analysis reveals a wealth of new and expanded opportunities for energy efficiency, a key conclusion is that no single measure will yield a dominant share of energy savings for utility program portfolios, as have CFL programs in the past. Without a single, dominant energy-efficient technology like the CFL, utilities and other program administrators will have to rely on a wider set of measures and attract greater numbers of participants. They also will have to ensure programs reach and serve all types of customers, including such often underserved markets as small businesses and multifamily housing.
Diversification is just one of the signs that energy efficiency has entered a new era. High levels of savings from programs and other advances in energy efficiency have helped to dramatically reduce US electricity demand. As this study shows, the future holds many opportunities for even greater energy savings. The cornucopia of energy efficiency will remain bountiful.

Can energy-intensive manufacturers be winners under the Clean Power Plan?;"There is a concern that any new environmental regulation can hurt the bottom lines of energy-intensive manufacturers. In the case of the EPA Clean Power Plan, states that comply with the rule by investing in energy efficiency will find the opposite is likely to be true: their businesses will be more productive and their economies will grow.
A coalition of energy efficiency and industry representatives spread that message last week in a letter urging governors to include industrial energy efficiency in their plans to comply with the Clean Power Plan. Fifteen organizations, including ACEEE, signed the letter and sent it to governors across the country to illustrate the multiple benefits that industrial sector energy efficiency provides, and to suggest tools and resources to help states assess industrial efficiency opportunities.
There is great potential in the industrial sector for saving both energy and money. A recent study led by the Department of Energy estimated that up to 32 percent of industrial energy use could be saved through cost-effective efficiency measures. These savings could significantly contribute to state efforts to comply with the Clean Power Plan, which clearly identifies energy efficiency as an important, proven strategy for cost-effectively lowering carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector. Meanwhile, many states harness only a fraction of their industrial efficiency potential, even though industrial programs have a lower cost of saved energy than any other end-use sector.
To help states capture these industrial sector savings in their compliance plans, a short list of helpful resources accompanies the coalition letter. The list distills the top ten most useful resources on industrial efficiency that states can use to assess market potential, evaluate options for policy and program design, and obtain guidance on including industrial efficiency in a state compliance plan. Several of the resources were discussed in detail during a July 31 webinar hosted by David Gardiner and Associates. Audio and slides of presentations given by the Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP), ACEEE, and Institute for Industrial Productivity (IIP) are available separately online.
The states and their industrial customers will end up better off if states commit to including industrial sector energy savings in their strategy for meeting Clean Power Plan targets. Industrial energy efficiency can achieve significant, low-cost emissions reductions, while also increasing in-state jobs, increasing economic competitiveness, and improving energy reliability. At the same time, industrial customers can also earn revenue from Clean Power Plan crediting mechanisms that encourage and reward the implementation of energy efficiency in the industrial sector, in addition to lowering their own operating costs through energy efficiency investments. That’s why states can’t afford to ignore industrial energy efficiency as they piece together their compliance plans.

Will Congress score a touchdown or drop the ball on energy efficiency?;"The NFL season is opening tomorrow, but the legislative season is already entering crunch time. Energy efficiency legislation is now on the field: energy efficiency titles are in the Senate bill, which passed out of committee in July and awaits time on the Senate floor, and the House bill, which may be considered by the full committee as early as next week.
We thought it was time to look at the stats. As we have in other years, we estimated the likely impacts of 15 proposed energy efficiency policies here. Since the House and Senate bills are moving targets, we combined the policies into three packages: the first down package with provisions that have received wide support, a more aggressive touchdown package, and a fumble package of provisions that drop the ball. Some of the impacts are shown in the figure below.
The first down package includes several provisions in the Senate bill and a few that should be added. It would really move the ball down the field. More specifically, it would:
save consumers almost $100 billion due to lower energy bills, even after needed investments,
create over 100,000 additional jobs by 2030, and also
reduce carbon dioxide emissions in that year by almost 50 million metric tons, the emissions of 10 million cars and light trucks.
More than half the savings are from a provision promoting better building energy codes from the Portman-Shaheen bill. Other notable provisions in the Senate bill include one on smart buildings from Senator Cantwell, and part of a bill on smart manufacturing from Senators Shaheen and Alexander—these would encourage faster deployment of new control technologies. Notable among provisions not yet in the Senate bill are the SAVE Act from Senators Bennet and Isakson on energy efficiency in mortgage underwriting, as well as the E-Access Act on consumer access to utility bill information from Senator Markey. These would be important additions to the team.
In contrast, the fumble package includes measures under consideration that would lose yardage from current energy efficiency efforts, including a provision that would limit assistance to states on building energy codes (Blackburn-Schrader) and bills that would block important efficiency standards for furnaces and for ceiling fans—and perhaps threaten the billions in consumer savings from the broader appliance efficiency standards program. This package would cost consumers $35 billion over time and result in 35,000 fewer jobs in 2030. That’s not a smart play.
The current House bill is not close to either of those packages. It only includes one relatively small, though positive, provision we analyzed that would strengthen Industrial Assessment Centers (it also is in the Senate bill). We hope they’ll be able to put some more points on the board as play goes on.
Finally, to show how far a long drive could take us, we analyzed a more comprehensive policy, a federal “energy efficiency resource standard” in a bill by Senator Franken. It would set minimum savings levels for electric and natural gas utility efficiency programs nationwide. We called it the touchdown package because it would change the game: almost $150 billion in net consumer savings, 400,000 more jobs in 2030, and 280 million metric tons lower carbon dioxide emissions in that year.
Like football, legislation can be a rough sport, and any season will have its highlight reel and its blooper reel. We hope that Congress won’t drop the ball, but will instead score some big wins this year with effective energy efficiency legislation—wins for consumers, the economy, and the environment.

Here are some new tools to support local energy efficiency;"Each step of a home improvement project requires the right tool. If you are planning to put up a new set of cabinets, for example, the first step requires measuring tape, assembly of the cabinets may require a drill, and then, finally, a hammer would be needed to actually mount them. A variety of tools—the right tools—are needed to complete the task.
This logic is no different when applied to the planning, design, and implementation of energy efficiency policies. Tools can provide localities with the know-how to advance energy efficiency throughout their communities. Policymakers, for example, can be tasked with assessing what energy efficiency policies make the most sense for their community, or with identifying which local stakeholders they should engage. The extent to which communities are equipped to readily answer those questions will vary; yet, all communities stand to benefit from learning about effective policies and strategies being implemented across the country. With the addition of some new resources, ACEEE hopes to expand communities’ toolboxes and provide the tools that help them achieve lasting energy savings.
The New and Improved LEEP-C
The Local Energy Efficiency Policy Calculator (LEEP-C) is a decision making tool for local policymaking. It estimates the impact select public and residential buildings policies have on energy savings, cost savings, pollution, and other outcomes. We have upgraded the original tool (v. 1.0, released in 2011) to include measures­ in the commercial building and transportation sector. Version 2.0 is being released as an open beta version, so ACEEE welcomes any feedback users have on the tool.
LEEP-C is not a panacea for energy efficiency planning. The projections provide a beginning to a much more in-depth analysis of potential policies. But, it can serve as a resource for communities planning to advance energy efficiency policies, including building retrofits and combined land use, to name a few. The tool’s value centers on its ability to incorporate a wide range of inputs, such as population, priorities, goals, and financing, when estimating policy impacts.
It is important to remember that LEEP-C is just one tool in the toolbox, and ACEEE has a variety of other tools to aid local policymakers in other steps involved in adopting energy efficiency policies and programs, which can be found in our Local Technical Assistance Toolkit.
The New Local Government-Utility Engagement Strategies Fact Sheet Series
We have also released new resources on Local Government-Utility Partnership Strategies that expand our local toolkit. The four webpages outline strategies and best practices for local government-utility engagement to expand or improve energy efficiency in communities. Together, these resources demonstrate the mutual benefits of energy efficiency partnerships to cities and utilities. Each page focuses on a different engagement strategy that can be adapted to meet the specific needs of the communities that use them. The partnership strategies that are in this toolkit include:
An Overview of the Benefits of Local Government-Utility Partnerships
Partnerships for Increasing Participation in Utility Energy Efficiency Programs
Partnerships for Facilitating Access to Community Energy Usage Data
Partnerships for Reducing Energy Use in Public Outdoor Lighting
We document the ways in which communities and their utilities benefit from energy and cost savings coming from increased participation in energy efficiency programs, installation of highly efficient LED streetlights, and better understanding of community-wide energy usage. It’s a win-win for local governments and the utilities that serve them. Cities gain additional resources to help meet their energy goals, while utilities achieve greater customer satisfaction, more program participation, and higher energy savings to further their policy objectives.
Future Resources
ACEEE has developed the resources on local government-utility partnership strategies to meet communities’ needs for more information about the topic. Our goal is to continue developing valuable policy resources for communities, so we want to hear ideas directly from you on how we can best do that. Are there other areas of energy efficiency policy for which your community needs assistance? Or are there other specific resources that would help your community implement efficiency policies? Feel free send your thoughts to David Ribeiro, dribeiro@aceee.org.

New Executive Actions Will Empower American Communities to Ramp Up Energy Efficiency;"Today, the Obama administration announced new actions to bring energy efficiency to households across the country. To support these efforts, public and private organizations have committed to support the deployment of energy efficiency technologies in low- and moderate-income communities. ACEEE, as one of these organizations, has committed to providing assistance to utilities, states, and localities to advance energy savings in these communities.  
Lauren Ross, ACEEE local policy manager, made this statement on President Obama’s announcement: “The executive actions and private sector commitments announced today by President Obama will increase access to energy efficiency and help ensure that all households benefit from low-cost technologies to help cut energy waste and save on their energy bills. These actions build on the administration’s longstanding commitment to advance clean energy, create jobs, and lower energy costs in low- and moderate-income communities.”
  The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.

How does your country rank for energy efficiency?;"Evaluating how countries use energy provides valuable information necessary to identify energy waste, improve energy systems, and promote smarter economic growth. An efficient economy is one that minimizes its energy needs while providing better access to goods and services.
For the past 35 years at ACEEE, we’ve informed policymakers and the public to advance energy efficiency in the United States through in -depth technical and policy analysis.
We leverage this expertise to understand how other countries manage their energy. Today ACEEE released the 2015 International Scorecard Self-Scoring Tool. Anybody can use this Excel-based tool to analyze the status of energy efficiency in their country or province, and compare themselves with the largest economies of the world.
The tool is based on the 2014 ACEEE International Energy Efficiency Scorecard, which is our second comparative study of energy efficiency policies and performance across the 16 top economies of the world. Countries examined include the United States, China, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Brazil, Italy, Russia, Canada, and Australia, along with the European Union as a whole. New entrants in the 2014 race were India, Spain, Mexico, and South Korea. In the analysis, we evaluate each of these economies using 31 metrics in four sectors: national efforts, industry, buildings, and transportation. The new self-scoring tool reflects these advancements in our analysis. The tool also has a more user-friendly interface than the first version.
The self-scoring tool is accompanied by a detailed user guide and a case study on South Africa. For the case study, we collected data using centralized sources available in the self-scoring tool and collaborated with South Africa country experts. South Africa scored a total of 36/100, indicating that there is much scope for improvement of energy efficiency in all sectors. More details are available in the case study.
The biggest challenge we face in comparing energy efficiency across economies is the lack of quality data. Partly, this difficulty arises from the lack of measurement of energy use in countries. For example, the metric “vehicle miles traveled per capita” in the self-scoring tool is an indicator of fuel used for motorized personal transport. The higher this number, the more the energy consumed for personal transport per capita in the country, and hence the lower the score for this metric. Tracking such data helps not only to understand travel trends of citizens, but also to identify strategies to reduce fuel consumption and formulate policies to provide efficient modes of transport, such as trains, buses, bicycle pathways, etc., that meet the mobility needs of the citizens.
Energy efficiency indicators become all the more significant in countries looking to develop or restore their infrastructure. Directed by this information, good energy policies can strengthen energy security and transform energy guzzlers into lean and mean economies.
We welcome your feedback on the 2015 International Scorecard Self-Scoring Tool. Please direct all comments and questions to ckallakuri@aceee.org. You can also help us improve our analysis by sharing the most recent data available for your country.

Energy Efficiency in the Clean Power Plan: Take One;"On August 3rd, EPA released the final Clean Power Plan (CPP), a rule that sets performance rates and individual state targets for carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. Now that the emissions targets are set, energy efficiency plays a prominent role as a proven strategy that states can use to reduce energy, cut emissions, and boost the economy. As we have said, it’s not important that energy efficiency is no longer a CPP building block. The fact is that it’s prominently featured as a key compliance option for states in EPA’s materials (see Energy Efficiency TSD and Key Topics and Issues Fact Sheet), as a component of the rule’s Regulatory Impact Analysis, and even in the president’s speech announcing the rule.
Now that we’ve had time for a first read-through of the final rule, we’ve found some significant changes from the proposed version.
Setting targets
EPA revised several aspects of the CO2 target-setting calculation. While the resulting changes in target stringency vary by state from the proposed to the final rule, on average the new 2030 targets are slightly stronger. The final rule provides emissions targets in the form of a state average emissions rate (pounds of CO2/MWh of electricity generated), and translates the targets into a mass-based goal for each state (tons of CO 2 per year from affected electric generating units [EGUs], i.e., coal and natural gas power plants). In addition, the rule now accounts for uniform CO2 performance rates for two specific EGUs. States can choose to comply using any of one of these emissions targets. Energy efficiency and nuclear energy were both removed from the building blocks that are used to set CO2 targets, while the application and data used for the remaining building blocks (heat rate improvements, fuel switching to natural gas combined cycle, and increasing renewable energy) were altered considerably from the proposed rule.
Timeline and pathways for compliance
The timeline for compliance with the rule has been pushed back to 2022, with the final compliance deadline remaining 2030 and thereafter. In addition, states are required to meet a series of interim compliance goals in 2024, 2027, and 2029. Under the final rule, energy efficiency improvements can count if they are installed after January 1, 2013 and will still be saving energy in 2022. These savings can continue to receive credit for each year over the 2022–2030 period in which they save energy.
In the final rule, EPA identifies a variety of energy efficiency measures, programs, and policies that can count toward compliance. These include utility and nonutility energy efficiency programs, building energy codes, combined heat and power, energy savings performance contracting, state appliance and equipment standards, behavioral and industrial programs, and energy efficiency in water and wastewater facilities, among others.
States can now comply using a variety of expanded pathways. The final rule allows for rate- or mass-based compliance at the EGU or statewide level. In addition, states can choose a pathway to trade individually or with other states. Within a rate-based compliance pathway, states can trade energy efficiency savings or bank them indefinitely using Emission Rate Credits (ERCs). EPA also released a draft EM&V guidance document for states complying with demand-side efficiency using a rate-based pathway. The key item is this guidance is that states must determine energy savings relative to a “common practice baseline.” While energy efficiency strategies used for mass-based compliance do not require EM&V to be documented within a state plan, the associated energy savings will help states meet their allowance goals.
EPA has also proposed an early-credit option for states called the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP). The CEIP awards early credit for low-income energy efficiency programs and certain renewable energy projects implemented in 2020 and 2021. The program offers a two-to-one match for state energy efficiency savings in order to jump-start these efforts in low-income communities.
Planning for the future
Energy efficiency will be a key component in low-cost plans as states contemplate their compliance options. State compliance plans are due September 6, 2016, but states can request a two-year extension. The final rule also requires states to incorporate the needs of low-income and underserved communities within their compliance plans, and fully engage these communities along with other stakeholders during the planning process. EPA is also requesting comments on several items that have not been finalized. These include the CEIP for early action credit and the draft federal plan for states that fail to submit a compliance plan by the September 2018 deadline, both available here. The EPA is also seeking comments on the Draft EM&V Guidance for Demand-side Energy Efficiency. The deadline for all three comment periods is 90 days after the final rule is published in the Federal Register, which likely means sometime in December. In the coming months, EPA will also be engaging stakeholders regarding the definition of low-income communities and the types of energy efficiency programs allowed under the CEIP.
Along with other organizations, ACEEE will be providing assistance to states as they develop compliance plans. We will also submit comments to the EPA regarding the outstanding energy efficiency items. Stay tuned for more information about these efforts and additional resources on energy efficiency in the CPP in future blog posts.

New York’s REV: Recent filings show that energy efficiency efforts vary widely;"New York State has been a leader in utility of the future efforts and embarked on a major initiative to change how it regulates energy utilities, called Reforming the Energy Vision (REV). In a blog post earlier this year, I described a major decision in the REV proceeding before the state’s Public Service Commission (PSC), and also raised some questions about the role of energy efficiency as REV moves forward.
Energy efficiency programs under REV
Under REV, the role of utilities in implementing energy efficiency efforts increases as programs operated by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) transition largely to an upstream focus on market transformation and improving the functioning of markets for clean energy. The PSC decision early this year set 2016 energy saving goals for utilities at the same level as their 2015 goals, but stated that “longer-term goals should exceed existing targets.” In our opinion, higher targets are needed, because in recent years (e.g., 2014) NYSERDA programs have saved more energy than the utility programs. With NYSERDA changing its focus, the expanded utility programs should, at a minimum, include the savings that NYSERDA programs previously achieved. The PSC asked the utilities to prepare three-year energy efficiency plans, and for NYSERDA to describe its plans in more detail. These plans were all filed in July and this blog post summarizes ACEEE’s initial review of these plans.
Energy efficiency plans range from strong to weak
Overall, the utilities' various plans are a mixed bag. On the positive side, National Grid, the state’s second largest investor-owned utility, proposed a plan that will achieve electric efficiency savings of about 0.9% of their distribution sales in their first year and ramp up to 1.2% of sales in the third year (these calculations are ACEEE’s as described below). National Grid’s New York savings are substantially greater than the other New York utilities, but still fall short of the greater-than-2.0%-per-year savings that National Grid is achieving in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
NYSERDA also proposed an extensive series of programs including both new “market development initiatives” and continuance of some existing programs through a transition period covering 2016, and in some cases (e.g., for multifamily buildings), through 2017. Some notable new initiatives address the energy efficiency of tenant spaces in commercial buildings, strategic energy management in industrial facilities, zero net energy and deep retrofits in both the residential and commercial sectors, and efforts to help prospective residential tenants and home buyers to assess the energy efficiency of a home or apartment before they sign a lease or contract. Also noteworthy, relative to earlier proposals, NYSERDA provides fewer funds to the New York Green Bank in the short term and instead shifts some of those funds to the latter years of the plan. The Green Bank already has hundreds of millions of dollars set aside and will not need additional capital for a while.
The plans of the state’s other large utilities, Consolidated Edison (Con Ed) and New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG), are not as promising. Con Ed’s plan calls for energy efficiency savings of about 0.4% of distribution sales in all three years, while NYSEG’s plan also targets savings of about 0.4% of distribution sales. Both the Con Ed and NYSEG plans include only a limited number of programs with a focus on commercial and industrial rebates, small commercial direct installation, and multifamily programs. In between, with savings of 0.5-0.8% of distribution sales, are the state’s other investor-owned utilities. These percentage savings calculations are shown in the table below for all of New York’s investor-owned utilities.
Source: ACEEE calculations of percentage savings targets using planned savings in individual utility plans and calculating these as a percent of 2013 electricity sales by utility as reported by the US Energy Information Administration (http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/). Our electricity sales numbers include both bundled sales (utility procures power) and delivery sales (customer procures power and utility delivers it), but for each utility we deduct a pro rata share of sales by the New York Power Authority (NYPA) since NYPA offers its own energy efficiency programs to its customers and therefore NYPA customers are not served by the other utility programs.
PSC needs to set more explicit targets
Based on ACEEE’s review, only National Grid is following the PSC’s desire to increase their energy saving targets over time. We recommend that the other utilities also follow this guidance and plan a steady expansion of their energy efficiency programs.
Most importantly, if the PSC wants the other utilities to increase their energy efficiency savings, they will need to be more explicit in setting new targets and not just letting the utilities base their energy savings targets on past achievements. In addition, our review of the utility plans indicates that transition plans are needed for some important NYSERDA programs that will be ending as NYSERDA shifts focus. Again, the PSC should specifically request such transition plans from the utilities, such as new construction programs, and multifamily and single-family retrofits. National Grid is proposing a new construction program, but such programs are not mentioned by Con Ed or NYSEG. New construction programs are particularly important because it is generally much less expensive to build efficiency into new construction than it is to build an inefficient building and have to retrofit it later. All three utility plans mention multifamily programs, but none provide any detail on how comprehensive these will be. National Grid appears to be planning a single-family program, Con Ed is unclear, and NYSEG does not appear to have such a program in their plans.
In addition, the next phase of the REV proceeding will be very important. In this phase, the PSC plans to move toward performance-based ratemaking, where utilities will be measured and rewarded based on several performance metrics. In late July, the PSC staff released a white paper on these issues. We will comment on this new white paper in a future blog post, but for now just note that it includes performance incentives for meeting energy efficiency targets, seemingly using the modest targets contained in the utility plans.
New York has been a leader on energy efficiency for decades, finishing as high as third in ACEEE state energy efficiency scorecards over the past nine years. National Grid and NYSERDA appear to be continuing this leadership tradition. Both the PSC and the other utilities will need to step up their energy efficiency efforts in order for New York as a whole to continue being an energy efficiency leader.

Using less energy to keep drinks cold;"Late yesterday, the Department of Energy (DOE) proposed strong new standards that would reduce the energy consumed by beverage vending machines to keep drinks cold. The proposed standards would cut energy use by 25-65% relative to the least-efficient machines available now, and save money for schools, hospitals, hotels, and other businesses and institutions where beverage vending machines are used.
Beverage vending machines meeting the new standards, sold over 30 years, would reduce national electricity consumption by 23 billion kilowatt-hours, an amount equal to the annual energy consumption of 2.1 million US households, netting savings of $0.4–1.1 billion for vending machine property owners.
DOE set the first national efficiency standards for beverage vending machines in 2009, which took effect in 2012. The current standards apply to common beverage vending machines where the complete machine is refrigerated. The new proposed rule would update the current standards and also establish new standards for “combination” beverage vending machines, where the machine includes both a refrigerated section to cool and hold beverages, as well as a non-refrigerated section to hold snack items, for example.
A key innovative element of the new proposed standards is crediting energy-saving control strategies.
The two main types of energy-saving controls used in beverage vending machines are lighting controls and refrigeration system controls. Lighting controls automatically dim or turn off the lights illuminating the beverages and any signage during periods when a building is closed or there is low customer traffic. Refrigeration system controls allow the temperature of the beverages in the machine to rise a few degrees during periods of extended inactivity before the machine automatically returns to normal vending temperatures.
Improved components, such as more-efficient compressors and fan motors and better heat exchangers, would also help meet the new standards.
DOE is scheduled to publish a final rule by February 2016, and the new standards would take effect three years later.

Energy Efficiency a Key Compliance Strategy for States in EPA Final Clean Power Plan Rule;"Washington—Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released the Clean Power Plan, a rule that sets state-specific targets for carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. As the president noted in today’s announcement, one of the most promising compliance options available for states under the rule is increasing their energy efficiency. Previous analysis by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) found that under the draft rule more than 50% of the required emissions cuts could be achieved through energy efficiency.
Energy efficiency programs are generally two to three times cheaper to implement than generating power from traditional sources, and have additional benefits, such as lower utility bills for customers and businesses and local job creation, according to research from ACEEE. This is confirmed in EPA economic analysis, which shows energy efficiency as a key element in efforts to keep the cost of today’s rule down.
Today’s final rule includes a new proposed early credit program for energy efficiency savings achieved in 2020 and 2021 in low-income communities. The rule also clarifies a number of particulars regarding the broad range of energy efficiency savings that can be counted, increasing the likelihood that states will include energy efficiency in their plans.
“EPA and the president have made it clear that investing in energy efficiency will be a major opportunity for states looking for ways to comply with the Clean Power Plan rule,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of ACEEE. “The inclusion of energy efficiency in compliance plans is much more important than whether energy efficiency is used in EPA calculations to develop individual state targets. Energy efficiency is generally the cheapest, fastest, and most readily available path for states looking to achieve substantial emissions reductions, while maintaining affordable and reliable power for their citizens.”
A majority of states already have significant experience employing energy efficiency as a utility-system resource. Currently, twenty-four states have an annual energy savings target, while forty-one states have adopted national model building codes. In addition, more than 30% of the U.S. industrial sector’s electricity needs are being met through combined heat and power.
ACEEE has developed a variety of resources to provide guidance to states looking to benefit from energy efficiency compliance strategies. To learn more, visit: http://aceee.org/topics/section-111d-clean-air-act

Which energy efficiency policies saved the most last year?;"We are periodically asked how much different policies have saved and which policies have had the largest impact. In our recent report on energy efficiency progress over the past 35 years, we reviewed many current energy savings estimates and projections. Here I wanted to summarize which policies appear to be saving the most energy today, looking at estimated energy savings in calendar year 2014. Our estimates are summarized in the table below.
Notes: ""Quads"" is quadrillian (10 to the 15th power) Btu. The US uses about 100 quads per year.
Assume 10,000 Btu per kWh (source energy).
x ENERGY STAR savings are from 2013
Vehicle standards
Vehicle fuel economy standards generated the largest energy savings in 2014, saving an estimated 7.3 quadrillion Btu of energy (called a “quad”; by way of scale, the US uses about 100 quads of energy annually). These figures, from the Department of Transportation (DOT), represent progress since standards first took effect in 1978 under legislation passed under President Ford. Furthermore, DOT expects these savings to grow substantially in coming years as a result of new fuel economy standards that have been set in recent years.
Appliance and equipment standards
The second largest savings, 5.4 quads, come from minimum efficiency standards on appliances and other types of energy-using equipment. These estimates come from a 2012 report with updates by Joanna Mauer of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. Congress has enacted standards on more than 50 products, beginning with legislation signed by President Reagan, and the Department of Energy (DOE) periodically revises these standards.
ENERGY STAR®
Third on the list is the ENERGY STAR program, including ENERGY STAR homes, buildings and equipment. EPA estimates that this program saved about 380 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity in 2013 (2014 data not yet available), which works out to 3.8 quads.
Utility sector energy efficiency programs
Fourth is energy efficiency programs funded by utility customers, and operated either by the utilities themselves or by other entities designated by states and utilities. These programs help utility customers save energy, reducing energy bills, and also help the utility and all ratepayers because saving a kWh is generally less expensive than generating a kWh. In 2013, these programs saved about 160 billion kWh (1.6 quads), and based on the increase in savings from in 2013, we estimate 2014 savings at about 1.8 quads. The data come from DOE’s Energy Information Administration as analyzed in our 35-year look-back.
Building codes
Building energy codes appear to be next on the list, saving an estimated 1.1 quads in 2014. This estimate is explained in a note at the end of this blog. Several model building energy codes were developed in the 1980s and are regularly updated, typically every three years. Most states adopt one of these model codes as a statewide code, and where a state does not have a code, major municipalities may adopt a code.
Federal R&D
Federal government energy efficiency research and development (R&D) appears to result in a similar level of savings as building codes but this estimate is very uncertain. Our figure is based on 2014 estimated savings from a 2001 study, which in turn is based on work by the National Academy of Sciences and the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. DOE has a substantial energy efficiency R&D effort that has contributed to such energy-saving products as LED lighting, electronic ballasts for fluorescent lamps, windows with special heat-reflective coatings, and advanced building analytic software. DOE has conducted more recent evaluations on individual R&D projects, but no one has compiled these recent evaluations into an estimate of the overall savings and other benefits from DOE’s R&D program.
Energy Service Companies
Energy service companies are private companies that generally identify, finance and install energy-saving measures and then manage their maintenance for the terms of their contract. Most of their contracts in the US are with municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals— institutions that are often capital short but are willing to enter into long-term contracts. A Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory study estimates they saved 0.34 quads of electricity in 2012, but we round up to about 0.5 quads to include savings in other fuels as well as savings from 2013 and 2014 projects.
Federal tax incentives
Rounding out our look at energy policies, federal energy efficiency tax incentives saved about 0.3 quads (2014 estimate from a 2011 study). Congress passed these credits in 2005 to encourage improvements in homes, appliances and commercial buildings. Many of them have since been extended.
Caveats
In reviewing these figures, several words of caution need to be kept in mind. First, these estimates come from a variety of sources and employ different methodologies. They should be considered approximate and not exact. Some of these estimates, such as for building codes and R&D, are highly approximate as discussed above. Second, there is likely some overlap between these savings estimates, and thus these figures should not be summed without adjusting for overlaps. In particular, there is likely overlap between ENERGY STAR, tax incentives, utility-sector programs, and energy savings performance contracts.
Policies and Markets
In our paper looking back on the past 35 years, we estimated that in 2014, energy efficiency measures implemented over the previous 35 years reduced US energy use by about 58 quads. Savings from the eight policies discussed here probably total a little under 20 quads (they total 21 quads but we round down due to overlap between policies). The remaining savings of about 40 quads are likely due to a combination of market forces as well as some policies not cataloged here, with the market forces probably dominant.
Our 35 year review concluded that many factors have driven energy efficiency gains, including market forces, policy impacts, and the interplay between the two. This blog post reinforces that conclusion, showing the large impact of policies, and the probably even larger impact of market forces. But without the direct impact of policies, and the indirect impact of policies on market forces, our energy savings would have been smaller, and our energy use and energy bills substantially higher. Going forward, we need to pay attention to both policies and market forces, and the productive synergies between them.
A Note on Savings from Building Energy Codes
Savings from building codes are approximate and are estimated from two sources. The two estimates are very similar, providing some assurance they are reasonable.
First, in 2004, we estimated savings in 2000 from codes adopted in the 1980s and 1990s, and also projected savings in 2020 from codes. We used these figures to estimate savings in 2014 by taking the estimate of 2000 savings from that report (0.537 quads), plus taking a portion of 2020 estimated savings based on construction through 2013, resulting in an estimate of 1.14 quads saved in 2014. The 2004 report estimated 0.935 additional quads in 2020, and we took 9/15 of these estimates, since the original estimate included 15 years of construction, nine of which took place by the end of 2014. The 2004 estimate for 2020 included projections of future code stringency and adoption and compliance rates. In retrospect, we were too conservative on stringency and a little too aggressive on adoption and compliance, but a back-of-the-envelope estimate indicates that these effects roughly offset each other.
Second, in 2014, Olga Livingston from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, along with co-authors, estimated the impact of the DOE Building Energy Codes Program. For 2014 they estimated savings of 0.57 quads. However, their estimate did not include four states (California, Florida, Oregon, and Washington, since DOE had little impact on these states); their estimate excluded an estimate (details not available) on what states would have done without DOE support; and their estimate did not include codes developed prior to 1992. We made rough estimates to adjust for these three factors. For the four states, we added to the savings based on the population in 2014 of these four states relative to the other states, adding 25%. For state actions not due to DOE, we added 30%, which is just a guess. For savings from pre-1992 codes, we took half of Nadel’s estimate for 2000, as this estimate included pre-1992 codes. After all three adjustments, the estimated savings from codes in 2014 totals 1.19 quads.
Both of these estimates are highly approximate, so rather than round up to 1.2 quads we round down to 1.1 quads. Better estimates of energy savings from codes would be useful. Tentatively, PNNL tells us that they are planning to do such an analysis in 2016.

Three cheers for Maryland!;"Last week the Maryland Public Service Commission released its long-awaited order on several key energy efficiency issues. The decisions in the order placed Maryland in the forefront of national energy efficiency leadership. Several key decisions highlight how important energy efficiency is to the future of the state of Maryland, and the value the Public Service Commission places on using energy efficiency to save customers money, reduce environmental pollution, and reduce utility costs. ACEEE worked closely with a large coalition of energy efficiency advocates to propose recommendations for several of the key issues in the order.
Here are highlights from three key decisions in the order:
2% Annual Savings Goal
The order established a new annual energy savings goal of 2% of baseline retail weather-normalized gross electric sales for each utility, for the five largest electric utilities in the state. Each utility will have until 2020 to reach the 2% annual goal, with a requirement to update 2017 efficiency plans to ramp up 0.2% annually to reach the goal. The new energy savings goal departs significantly from the previous goal, which required utilities to achieve per capita energy savings of 15% by 2015. The 2% goal puts Maryland in line with other leading states, such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Arizona, and Vermont, in terms of energy savings targets.
Cost Effectiveness Standards
The order also established new standards for testing programs for cost effectiveness. The cost effectiveness rules are critical because these tests produce one of the metrics that determine which programs a utility will offer. Previously, Maryland primarily relied on the total resource cost test to screen programs. Now, the societal cost test will also be used to evaluate programs. This test considers costs and benefits of a program from a societal perspective and is not as limited as the total resource cost test, which only includes a narrow list of benefits. In short, the societal cost test is a better indicator of the value of energy efficiency programs because it considers a broader perspective. The societal cost test will also rely on a different discount rate than the total resource cost test. A discount rate is used to calculate the benefits of a program in the future and is an extremely important part of the program screening process. If the discount rate is too high, the benefits in later years will appear to be less than they really are. The societal test will use a lower discount rate meant to represent the value of future benefits from a societal prospective. A lower discount rate is also better in this case because it reflects the reduced level of risk a utility takes on when making investments in energy efficiency.
Multiple Benefits
The order also directed utilities to include the multiple, non-energy benefits of energy efficiency when evaluating programs, such as increased comfort, reduced utility carrying cost for arrearages, and air pollution benefits (for more information on this topic, see our recent reports on the multiple benefits of energy efficiency programs in the multi-family and business sectors). The non-energy benefits approved by the Commission include multiple benefits beyond the societal prospective, including participant and utility-specific non-energy benefits. While the number of states including multiple benefits has increased in recent years, still only a handful of states consider these valuable benefits in program screening. The inclusion of multiple benefits is important because it allows consideration of all relevant benefits when implementing energy efficiency programs. Excluding benefits can have adverse impacts on resource selection and lead to higher costs for customers when higher-cost resources are used instead of lower-cost efficiency.
State of the Future
This landmark order will have positive effects on the state of Maryland for years to come. The EmPower Maryland energy efficiency programs have been highly successful to date, and the Commission’s guidance in this order will only bolster the success of the programs. The order also directed working groups to propose specific energy savings goals for natural gas utilities and limited-income electric programs. The goals will drive greater performance in both of these areas, providing reduced costs and substantial benefits to all utility customers in Maryland.

Congress takes three steps forward with energy efficiency bills but finish line unclear;"This week has been an active one for energy efficiency on Capitol Hill. Yesterday Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee chair Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and ranking member Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released a draft energy bill, with one out of the four titles focusing on energy efficiency. Also yesterday, the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved an energy bill, including several energy efficiency provisions. And the day before, the Senate Finance Committee approved extensions of a variety of tax incentives, including three that address energy efficiency. These actions are only early steps in the process of enacting legislation, but progress on three bills in one week is certainly notable.
Senate and House release bipartisan energy bills
In terms of specifics, the Senate energy bill incorporates many of the provisions in the bipartisan Energy Savings and Industrial Competiveness Act introduced by Senators Portman (R-OH) and Shaheen (D-NH). Particularly notable is a provision to assist states and voluntary code organizations to improve building energy codes. Other provisions added to the committee bill include sections to encourage smart buildings and smart manufacturing that ACEEE helped to develop, a pilot grant program for non-profit organizations including religious institutions, improvements to programs that use energy service companies to finance energy efficiency improvements in federal facilities, and reauthorization and updating of the federal Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program. On the other hand, we are troubled that the bill does not include a provision from the Portman-Shaheen bill, the SAVE Act, which would encourage recognition of energy savings when efficient homes are financed with mortgages.
The energy efficiency portion of the House bill has many fewer energy efficiency provisions than the Senate bill. It includes provisions on energy-saving information technologies, energy-efficient data centers, coordination of energy retrofitting assistance for schools, and reauthorization of the Industrial Assessment Center program that are also in the Senate bill. In addition, the House bill includes a provision that is not in the Senate bill to add information to appliance Energy Guide labels for products that have smart grid capabilities. Also notable is the fact that the House bill only includes provisions that are bipartisan—we were concerned that some provisions might be included that would hinder efficiency improvements in building codes and equipment efficiency standards.
Despite all the activity this week, the path to law for the energy bill is uncertain. The Senate Energy Committee will consider amendments to its bill next week, and the full House Energy and Commerce Committee will likely consider amendments in September. The House committee leadership has indicated that a variety of partisan issues will be considered then. In both the House and Senate there is a risk that partisan amendments to the bills on efficiency or other issues will endanger their support, or that the bills will simply get lost amidst other issues. But the committees have defied political considerations to keep a bipartisan process so far.
Bill to extend tax incentives includes energy efficiency
The Senate Finance Committee bill extends a variety of energy efficiency tax incentives until the end of 2016. Most of the efficiency tax incentives expired at the end of 2014, and are described here. Included are new home, commercial building, and residential upgrade incentives. The bill, if enacted into law, will cover efficiency investments made in 2015 and 2016. For the most part the bill just changes the expiration dates, but it does include a number of other changes. On home upgrades, it updates and improves the qualification levels for residential window, water heater, boiler, cool roof, and wood stove incentives, and expands the credit to cover labor costs. The bill also modifies the baseline for calculating commercial building incentives; and permits tribal governments and non-profit organizations to transfer eligibility for the incentive to the person designing the property, since the incentive is not useful to organizations that do not pay taxes. Details on what the committee did can be found on pages 6-7 here.
For the tax incentives bill, the House has indicated it is in no hurry and will not work on a bill until fall. It is unclear whether a tax incentive bill will ultimately be voted on by the full Senate and House, or whether tax incentive provisions will be added to some other major piece of legislation such as an appropriations continuing resolution or omnibus year-end package. It is also possible the House will do something different than the Senate; last year, the House passed a simple extension without any changes, but the committee chairman has also talked about seeking more substantial tax changes such as a “down payment on tax reform” this fall.
Outlook: cloudy but possible sunshine
While it’s too early to know what the final results could be, this week’s promising actions begin to fill in the possible contours of energy efficiency legislation for this year. But we are early in the process and there are many twists and turns in the legislative path ahead. ACEEE, and many of our allies, will be working hard to get the best possible legislation for energy efficiency across the finish line.

We need your data!;"ACEEE is participating in a collaborative effort to develop new energy performance labels for pumps, fans, and compressors that will become the basis of a new type of energy efficiency program with prescribed savings values. Our Industry Program has joined with the Hydraulic Institute (HI), Air Movement and Control Association International (AMCA), Compressed Air and Gas Institute (CAGI), Fluid Sealing Association (FSA), National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and a dozen utilities and energy efficiency programs to get this initiative underway, which ultimately will provide incentives to commercial and industrial energy consumers to purchase more efficient pumps, fans, and compressors.
The Extended Motor Product Label Initiative (EMPLI), which has been described in detail in a prior post, has reached the point where product category-specific application and operational data is needed by the working groups to determine the average potential savings. We are starting with collecting water pumping system operating hours and loads. This information will be used in program proposals to state public service commissions to document that labeled products save energy.
To collect, anonymize, and aggregate the data, the collaborative is working with the Hydraulic Institute and NEMA Business Information Services (NEMA Biz). A data collection sheet is available on the HI website for download, and NEMA Biz has been contracted to confidentially collect and analyze the data. Organizations interested in participating need only download the data collection form from HI’s webpage for this effort, fill it out, and submit it electronically to NEMA Biz at harrisons@nema.org. All individual company data will remain secure and will not be shared with anyone. The data being requested by the EMPLI pump working group is general in nature: hours of operation, percentage loading, product performance, and markets served. NEMA Biz will anonymize and aggregate the data and then provide it to the EMPLI pump working group in the form necessary for state public utility commissions to be able to use for program justification and evaluation.
Organizations that participate will also receive a copy of the aggregated data. This information will provide insights into the marketplace and enable participants to position their products for new utility-sector funding opportunities. The better the data, the more complete the report will be for all involved.
Collection of operational data is necessary for the success of the EMPL Initiative. The goal of this collaborative effort is the development of new voluntary product performance labels that can be used as purchasing specifications by companies and public institutions, and that can become the basis for an entirely new type of prescriptive rebate energy efficiency program that attributes or “deems” an average energy savings to a qualifying product.To all the companies that serve the commercial and industrial sectors, we join HI in requesting your participation in this survey. And to all who participate in this data collection effort, a big “Thank You!” from all of us participating in EMPLI. This is an important effort for the industrial energy efficiency community; so let others know and please forward this notice!

The E2e weatherization study: generating more heat than light;"A recent academic working paper on the low-income weatherization assistance program in Michigan, by researchers associated with the E2e project, has created much controversy. My colleague Marty Kushler recently published a blog post criticizing the paper and its accompanying policy brief; many others have done the same (see links at the bottom to read more). As the critiques have noted, there are two primary concerns with this paper:
1. The paper looks at one program in one state and inappropriately seeks to apply the results to all residential energy efficiency programs.
2. The evaluation focuses only on energy savings and ignores the fact that low-income weatherization is not only designed to save energy, but also has other objectives, such as improving occupant safety, health and comfort, addressing structural problems in homes, and reducing utility bill arrearages.
In this blog post, I’d like to take a broader look at some important issues this paper raises, building on these two points and also raising a couple of additional issues.
Methodology
First, parts of this study use an experimental research design called a randomized controlled trial, where researchers define a pool of eligible customers and randomly assign some of the eligible customers to a treatment group and some to a control group. In this way the treatment and control groups are identical. This is a powerful research approach but also has an Achilles heel: you cannot generalize the findings to households and programs that are different from those that you studied, because different types of households and different programs can have characteristics that would change the findings. In this case, they looked at weatherization of low-income households in a few counties in Michigan, and the results cannot be generalized to other states, to other programs, or to other income groups.
To illustrate the point, a study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory is looking at 30,000 homes that participated in the low-income weatherization program across the country (and not just one state). Preliminary results from this study find that, relative to a control group, benefits are on average about 1.7 times the cost––a very different result from the E2e study. While there are some differences between E2e’s approach and the quasi-experimental approach used by Oak Ridge, the big difference is in geographic coverage.
Missed benefits
Second, many energy efficiency programs and investments serve multiple purposes. To compare all costs against only some benefits is to bias the analysis. In this case the paper in one place seeks to assign all the costs to energy savings and in another place puts all the costs on carbon reduction; nowhere do they look at other important benefits of the program. To fairly evaluate such programs and investments, either all of the benefits need to be quantified and compared to the full costs, or if only energy benefits are quantified, then only the incremental costs of the energy efficiency improvements should be counted. Given that the weatherization program being studied is deliberately intended to achieve multiple benefits beyond simple energy savings, a more comprehensive assessment of benefits should have been done.
Market-only agenda
Third, it appears that one of the aims of this study was to discuss the most efficient approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (this is the title of item #1 in their policy brief). In the brief they recommend market-based approaches like cap-and-trade programs and carbon taxes. While ACEEE supports such market-based approaches, we recognize the need to use multiple approaches to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including energy efficiency programs. The country will also need to use multiple approaches in order to meet broader energy and social goals. A carbon tax is unlikely to do much to address the needs of low-income households, just as greenhouse gas reduction is not the main purpose of low-income weatherization. Rather than tear down one approach at the expense of another, it would be useful to assemble a set of complementary approaches, using evaluation to make each approach as good as it can be. Biasing research, even toward a noble end, can undercut efforts to build support and find “win-win” synergies.
Missing review
Fourth, this paper is labeled a “working paper.” It has not yet been peer reviewed. Rather than release an un-reviewed study to the press to great fanfare, it would have been much more appropriate to share the results with energy efficiency evaluation and low-income weatherization experts (and not just economists) to get feedback on the draft report, learn about any problems with the draft study, and revise the study to address the problems. The issues that are being raised on many blogs regarding the E2e paper would have been much better raised in a peer-review process, rather than in the press and other public forums. This is not the first time we have had to criticize unbalanced research or inappropriate spin coming out of E2e (for other examples see here and here). The authors are all university professors; we presume this is not the way they are teaching their students to publish research.
Michigan, Wisconsin, and the media
What does this mean going forward? While we strongly support research to determine how well energy efficiency programs are functioning in practice, we hope that the E2e project does a better job in the future to seek external review before they release their findings. They should also fairly balance both the energy and non-energy benefits and costs of the programs they examine.
They can start in Wisconsin. One of the authors of the Michigan study told the Associated Press that he is finding similar results in a study of middle-income homes in Wisconsin. We strongly suggest that this new study receive expert review before it is released, and that it consider non-energy costs and benefits. Expert-reviewed research by ACEEE and others has found that non-energy benefits are also prevalent in middle-income homes. It also bears noting that middle-class weatherization, like low-income weatherization, is relatively expensive. It would be doubly irresponsible to generalize the new results to other energy efficiency programs, after picking two of the most expensive examples. For a little perspective, Lawrence Berkley Laboratory found in a recent report that whole-home weatherization programs cost utilities an average of 9.4 cents per kWh saved, while the average residential program costs only 3.3 cents per kWh saved.
We hope that the press is much more careful when it examines future E2e papers. While there is some excellent research coming out of this project, there are also a distressing number of questionable papers. Good research is immensely valuable, but poor or mischaracterized research can be far more harmful in the short term, given the media’s penchant for counterintuitive stories. The result is to hinder the ability to make rational policy decisions.

35 years of energy efficiency progress, 35 more years of energy efficiency opportunity;"In 1973, the Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed an oil embargo that increased energy prices, spurring efforts to conserve energy and improve energy efficiency in the US and worldwide. In 1980, energy efficiency researchers formed the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. As we turn 35 years old this year, we thought it would be useful to look at energy efficiency progress over the past 35 years, and to also look at possible and recommended pathways for the next 35 years. Today we are releasing the results of this work in a report entitled Energy Efficiency in the United States: 35 Years and Counting.
The Past 35 Years
From 1980 to 2014, US energy use increased by 26%; however, over this same period, gross domestic product (GDP) increased 149%. “Energy intensity,” defined as energy use per real dollar of GDP, is a common approach for combining these two variables. US energy intensity has declined from 12.1 thousand Btu per dollar in 1980, to 6.1 in 2014, a 50% improvement. While part of that improvement can be attributed to structural changes in the economy, we conservatively estimate that about 60% of the improvement in energy intensity is due to efficiency improvements, saving consumers and businesses about $800 billion in 2014. Dividing by the US population, energy efficiency saved about $2500 per capita in 2014. These efficiency investments and savings also generated jobs and drove modest growth in the overall size of the economy (check out our fact sheet to learn how energy efficiency creates jobs).
Energy efficiency savings over the past 35 years have also improved our nation’s energy security and our environment. For example, fuel economy improvements and standards have driven down oil use in the transportation sector. Looking specifically at petroleum, imports were 33% of US crude oil use in 1983 (the recent low point), increasing to 67% in 2006 before declining to 44% in 2014. Reductions in oil, natural gas, and electricity consumption also mean reduced emissions from the combustion of fuels, including reduced emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (contributors to acid rain and smog), mercury and other toxic metals (contributors to health problems), and carbon dioxide (the largest contributor to greenhouse gas). In 2014, US carbon dioxide emissions totaled 5,404 million metric tons (MMT), 10% below 2005 levels.
These overall improvements are a result of many small and large improvements throughout our economy, including improvements to equipment, new and existing buildings, industrial processes, vehicles, planes, and the electric grid. Some of these improvements are illustrated in the figure below.
Many factors have driven these efficiency improvements, including market forces, policy impacts, and the interplay between the two. To take one example, appliances have improved dramatically due to the combined impacts of federal and state appliance efficiency standards, the voluntary ENERGY STAR® labeling program that recognizes products of above-average efficiency, utility energy efficiency programs, and tax incentives that have encouraged manufacturers to develop more efficient products. On the other hand, energy prices have not been a major driver, since energy prices today are either similar to, or less than, 1980 prices, after the effect of inflation is removed.
The Next 35 Years
While much progress has been made, there are large and cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities that collectively can reduce 2050 energy use by 40-60% relative to current forecasts. Opportunities include:
Improved systems integration, including use of sensors, controls, “big data” and computer chips to monitor and control energy use in real time, a set of opportunities that has been labeled “intelligent efficiency;”
Improvements to the many types of equipment, such as computers, televisions, and elevators that collectively account for growing miscellaneous energy loads;
Evolution of new building design to zero net energy and ultra-low energy buildings;
Industrial process improvements;
Increased use of advanced vehicles including electric, hybrid, and self-driving vehicles;
Taking building energy retrofits to a much higher level, including both more retrofits and deeper retrofits (greater savings per building);
Improving the efficiency of the electric grid through expanding use of combined heat and power systems, improving power plant efficiency, reducing transmission and distribution losses, expanding use of other distributed generation resources, and improving grid control and integration;
Promoting sustainable development and transportation patterns; and
Working with consumers and businesses to change wasteful energy-using behaviors.
If we aggressively pursue these efficiency opportunities, we can roughly double the rate of efficiency improvement in the next 35 years relative to the past 35 years, and reduce 2050 energy use to half of current forecasts. To do this we need to take our efforts to promote energy efficiency to a new level, which means both doing it better and doing it smarter. Our efforts should:
Harness and transform markets
Make efficiency a key strategy for the utility of the future
Expand federal, state, and local policy efforts
The new report discusses these strategies in more detail, but take a look at the infographic below to see a snapshot of the past and future 35 years of energy efficiency. Our nation’s history of success with energy efficiency shows us what efficiency can do, and provides important lessons that will help guide us to leave a positive economic and environmental legacy for future generations.

Energy Efficiency Works: US Energy Use Per Dollar Cut in Half in Last 35 Years;"Huge Advances in Energy Efficiency Spurred Economic Growth, Jobs, Lowered Bills; Consumers and Businesses Saved About $800 Billion Due to Energy Efficiency Last Year.
Washington, D.C. – Energy efficiency has made major strides in the US in the last 35 years, with “energy intensity” – the measurement of energy used per dollar of gross domestic product – down from 12.1 thousand Btus per dollar in 1980 to 6.1 thousand Btus per dollar in 2014, according to a major new report from the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
ACEEE found that about 60 percent of the improvement in energy intensity over the report’s 35-year period was due to energy efficiency and about 40 percent to major structural changes in the economy. The bottom line: Just the energy efficiency portion saved US consumers and businesses about $800 billion in 2014, roughly $2,500 per capita. Even though U.S. energy use edged up by 26 percent from 1980 to 2014, the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 149 percent.
The ACEEE report is available online at http://aceee.org/research-report/e1502.
Issued to mark ACEEE’s 35th anniversary, “Energy Efficiency in the U.S.: 35 Years and Counting” also looks ahead and concludes that “(w)hile much progress has been made, there are large and cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities that, by 2050, can collectively reduce energy use by 40–60 percent relative to current forecasts.”
Examples of energy-efficiency advances since 1980 cited in the report include the following:
The energy use of new clothes washers has declined by more than 70 percent.
The energy use of new homes per square foot has declined by nearly 20 percent.
Industrial energy use per unit value of product is down by nearly 40 percent.
The fuel economy of passenger vehicles has improved by more than 25 percent.
Energy losses in the US electric transmission and distribution system have declined by more than 25 percent.
Report co-author and ACEEE Executive Director Steven Nadel said: “Energy efficiency has made great strides in the past 35 years, and we have learned many important lessons on how markets and policies can work together to advance it. Looking forward, we find opportunities to reduce 2050 energy use by half relative to a business-as-usual reference case. In order to harvest these large efficiency opportunities, we need to take our efforts to a higher level. The challenges are many, but so are the benefits in terms of lower energy bills, a stronger economy, improved energy security, and a cleaner environment. The past has shown us what efficiency can do and it can guide us to even greater success in the future.”
The ACEEE report notes: “Efficiency investments and savings also generate jobs, including direct jobs installing efficiency measures, indirect jobs upstream in the supply chain, and jobs induced as energy bill savings are spent elsewhere and multiply through the economy. Energy savings can also help to drive modest overall growth in the US economy … Further, energy efficiency savings over the past 35 years have contributed to our nation’s security and improved our environment … Reductions in energy consumption also mean reduced emissions of fuel-combustion by-products, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (contributors to acid rain and smog), mercury and other toxic metals (contributors to health problems), and carbon dioxide (the predominant greenhouse gas).”
To achieve even deeper energy efficiency advances in the next 35 years, the ACEEE report recommends:
Better systems integration, including through “intelligent efficiency,” i.e., the use of sensors, controls, big data, and computer chips to monitor and control energy use in real time.
Improvements to the many types of equipment (such as computers, televisions, and elevators) that collectively account for growing miscellaneous energy loads.
Evolution of building design to yield zero net energy and ultra-low-energy buildings.
Industrial process improvements.
Increased use of advanced vehicles, including electric, hybrid, and self-driving vehicles.
Taking building energy retrofits to a much higher level, including more widespread and deeper retrofits for larger savings per building.
Better efficiency of the electric grid through expanded use of combined heat and power systems, greater power plant efficiency, reduced transmission and distribution losses, expanded use of other distributed generation resources, and improved grid control and integration.
Promotion of sustainable development and transportation patterns.

Energy Efficiency in Senate Bills will Make US Economy Healthier – But One Bill Contains a Poison Pill;"Today the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted out two bills—one shepherded by Energy and Natural Resources Committee chair, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) (the Energy Policy Modernization Act), and the other written by Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) (the Energy Efficiency and Industrial Competitiveness Act, S. 720).
“ACEEE strongly supports the Portman-Shaheen bill because it contains many useful provisions that will advance energy efficiency in the US” said ACEEE executive director Steven Nadel. “However, we cannot support the Murkowski bill, even though it contains some useful provisions, because it contains a ‘poison pill’ that undermines collaboration and impedes progress on energy efficiency,” he continued.
The Portman-Shaheen bill in particular contains provisions that will advance building energy codes in the country and incorporate the impact of reduced energy bills in mortgage underwriting decisions on efficient homes.
The Murkowski bill contains the same provision to advance building energy codes, but not the provision to consider energy efficiency in mortgage underwriting. The Murkowski bill does contain several useful additional provisions that will promote smart manufacturing and smart buildings, which save energy through advanced information systems and controls. However, the Murkowski bill also contains a very contentious provision that would override two previous agreements (one in court, one in the House of Representatives) on when new furnace efficiency standards can be finalized, substantially delaying the rule, even though the current standard has not changed significantly since it was enacted in 1987. This provision instead sets up a process that is more likely to fan the flames of disagreement rather than lead to a consensus outcome. “For several decades, Congress has only advanced energy efficiency provisions that have broad support and avoided fanning controversy. Unfortunately, the ‘Energy Policy Modernization Act’ violates this principle. We hope that comity will prevail and this provision will be changed on the Senate floor,” concluded Nadel.

Continuing the conversation on efficiency and the water-energy nexus;"How much energy does it take to fill a glass with drinking water? If you take into account the energy to transport the water from its source through the treatment and distribution process and into your faucet, there’s a lot of embedded energy that goes into that glass of water. And that’s not even getting into any energy used in the wastewater treatment process.
It’s a simple question, but a challenging one to answer. It’s valuable, though, for water utilities to better understand the embedded energy in their systems so they can reduce costs, improve energy efficiency, and quantify the avoided energy and pollution savings that accrue from water efficiency programs. And it’s all the more important with the exceptional drought spreading across the West.
ACEEE researched this topic in a white paper released last year, Watts in a Drop of Water: Savings at the Water-Energy Nexus, which gathered data from existing literature on energy savings associated with water savings. Today we’re releasing a new paper, A Survey of Energy Use in Water Companies, representing the next step in our research. The paper presents data we collected, in collaboration with the National Association of Water Companies (NAWC) , on the energy required to treat and distribute water. The data was collected through a survey to some of NAWC’s member companies.
The response was not as high as we hoped, but we received real-world data from a selection of water utilities on how they use energy by activity, such as source/conveyance, treatment, and distribution. We also quantified how energy intensive these water companies’ processes are by examining the amount of energy required to process a million gallons of water. The results are similar to our past research, showing the mean energy intensity of our sampled water systems to be 2,300 kWh/million gallon.
The energy consumption of water can vary dramatically in the water service sector (source, conveyance, and treatment) due to a variety of factors, including the size of the water system, pumping requirements between geographic locations, and raw water characteristics. But variations also suggest room for improvement in how efficiently these systems/companies use energy to process, treat, pump, and distribute water. Most companies we surveyed have begun efforts to improve their energy efficiency through measures like energy audits of their facilities, capital investments in energy efficiency measures, and operational improvements. However, while several companies have leak-detection programs to reduce drinking water losses through pipe systems, fewer companies have embraced water conservation programs. In the survey, we asked about various potential conservation efforts including water audits for customers, direct installs of water saving technology, and water conservation incentives. Because energy is embedded in water through the water system, water conservation programs save energy and shouldn’t be overlooked.
We still need more data on the energy intensities of systems to build out this analysis. But one thing is clear: while a few respondents to our survey are ahead of the curve, there are more opportunities for greater energy efficiency, water conservation, and joint-program partnership between energy and water utilities.

Efficiency in the Clean Power Plan: What are states doing? What should they be doing?;"We’re currently stuck in Clean Power Plan limbo. The EPA’s comment submission deadline is behind us, the final rule is ahead of us, and the temptation to act like school’s out for summer is real. While it’s still unclear exactly how states should credit all efficiency measures in their plans, it is clear that states will have an easier time reducing energy waste, diverting carbon pollution, and complying with the Clean Power Plan if they put their thinking caps on now. One way states can dramatically lower the cost of compliance is by including energy efficiency in their compliance plans. ACEEE’s State and Utility Pollution Reduction Calculator helps states understand just how cost effectively energy efficiency can lower emissions. For a couple examples, let’s highlight major energy efficiency opportunities in Illinois and Virginia.
Illinois
Illinois has engaged other Midwestern states through the Midcontinent States Environmental and Energy Regulators stakeholder group, exploring the implications and feasibility of regional Clean Power Plan compliance in non-binding discussions. Within the state’s boundaries, pending legislation could make using energy efficiency as a compliance mechanism easier.
Illinois should be commended for its proactive 2% annual energy savings target in 2015. However, a cap on spending has impeded the state’s realization of this target, and a recent proposal by Governor Rauner to re-route a portion of ratepayer dollars earmarked for low-income efficiency programs into the state’s general fund will make achieving those goals even more difficult.
If Illinois commits to achieving 2% electricity savings annually through 2030, it would divert 43 million tons of CO2 in 2030. Another opportunity for growth is in the state’s combined heat and power (CHP) programs, for which Illinois has strong market favorability. If the state installed 2,500 MW of CHP—half of its technical potential —it would reduce 12 million tons of CO2 in 2030. Together, the savings target and the CHP deployment, displayed in the chart below, would allow Illinois to achieve an incredible 85% of its Clean Power Plan target!

Virginia
Governor Terry McAuliffe has demonstrated leadership in Virginia by appointing a chief energy efficiency officer and appointing the Executive Committee on Energy Efficiency, which met for the first time on June 1st. Governor McAuliffe’s public support for the Clean Power Plan should be commended, but it is important for the state to quickly shift into gear to meet its target. Virginia could capture the momentum of the governor's efforts to reduce energy consumption in state buildings, and educate municipalities and counties about energy performance contracting. The state could designate a state agency to help implement energy service performance contracts (ESPCs), or offer financial incentives for agencies seeking to use ESPCs, avoiding over 2 million tons of CO2 in 2030.
The state could also adopt the latest IECC and ASHRAE building energy codes, regularly adopting new codes every three years through 2030, to reduce its CO 2 emissions in 2030 by almost 7 million tons. Virginia also has room for growth in its deployment of CHP technology.
Another huge opportunity in Virginia is an energy savings target. The state has a voluntary 10% savings goal by 2022, as written inlegislation, or by 2020, as accelerated by Governor McAuliffe. However, Virginia is behind on efforts to reach this goal. By achieving 1% electricity savings annually through 2030, Virginia could avoid over 10 million tons of CO2 in 2030. As the icing on the cake, if Virginia installed 1,000 MW of CHP, divided evenly between the commercial and industrial sectors, it could divert over half a million tons of CO2 in 2030. As seen in the table below, this suite of programs would get Virginia 99% of the way towards its Clean Power Plan target—an A+ approach if there ever was one.

How else can states prepare?
With EPA’s 2016 deadline for individual state plans, there is an imminent need for states to take early action towards evaluating efficiency opportunities and taking first steps towards Clean Power Plan compliance. Additional steps that states could take now include:
Identify existing energy efficiency programs that could be used to meet emission performance levels . This will help states understand how to play to their own strengths.
Begin forecasting the carbon pollution reduction potential of efficiency policies . ACEEE’s State and Utility Pollution Reduction (SUPR) calculator can do just that.
ACEEE’s Role
In order to help states understand how to incorporate efficiency into their compliance plans, ACEEE is working on a series of guidance documents for states as they put pen to paper. ACEEE recently released templates for states’ inclusion of building codes, energy efficiency financing programs, and combined heat and power in their plans. With such a flexible syllabus from EPA, states truly have the power to chart their own path to success. Let ACEEE know how we can help!

Residential energy efficiency works. Don’t make a mountain out of the E2e molehill;"The Internet has been burning up these last two days with reactions to a new academic working paper (Do Energy Efficiency Investments Deliver? Evidence from the Weatherization Assistance Program) by researchers at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) and the University of California, Berkeley, associated with the E2e Project.
Let me be blunt and to the point. The “results” of this very narrowly focused and arguably conceptually flawed study are being blown out of proportion, with many news article headlines taking this one example as representative of all residential energy efficiency programs. Unfortunately, this flawed conclusion has been promoted by the Energy Policy Institute themselves in their press release and accompanying policy brief.
For those not yet familiar with this story, the authors conducted a study of one particular low-income program (the federal Weatherization Assistance Program, or WAP), as implemented in portions of one state (Michigan), and somehow ended up with the sweeping headline “Study Finds Costs of Residential Energy Efficiency Investments are Double the Benefits.”
Some of the popular press is already picking up on this theme, and the concern is that a misunderstanding (or misuse) of this study will lead to low-income families having less access to important programs that drive down their utility bills. Or worse yet, as a broad-brush attack on all types of energy efficiency programs.
Evaluation wonks will be able to point to several minor to moderate problems with the study’s assumptions and calculations. But in the interest of time, let me focus on two fundamental flaws in the study and how the results are being “spun.”
Knocking down a straw man
First, the authors create a “straw man” implication that somehow the WAP is expected to be cost effective by simply comparing the direct energy savings to the total project costs to serve the home. In reality, no knowledgeable expert in this field expects the WAP (or any typical low-income program operated by utility companies) to be cost-effective solely on the basis of direct energy savings. States commonly exempt low-income programs from the usual cost-effectiveness tests. This is in part due to the very poor condition of the housing stock, and the major costs involved in upgrading the housing. It is also in recognition of the special needs of that target population, and that they have no discretionary income to devote to energy improvements, leaving the program to pay the entire costs.
As a result, these programs are typically judged by including the associated “non-energy benefits” in addition to the direct energy savings. These multiple benefits include things like the effects on comfort, health, safety (e.g., WAP typically installs smoke detectors, CO detectors, fixes wiring problems, fixes gas leaks, etc.), increased value of the improved housing stock, reduced utility-bill payment arrearages and non-payment collection costs (which saves money for all ratepayers), improved ability to remain in the dwelling and not have to be relocated, etc.
Studies exist in the industry that quantify these types of variables, and when taken in aggregate, the non-energy benefits’ value can nearly equal, or even exceed, the direct energy savings value. DOE’s last meta-evaluation of the Weatherization Assistance Program found direct energy savings averaging $3,917 and non-energy benefits valued at $3,466, or nearly as much as the direct energy savings benefits). Viewed in that comprehensive manner, programs like WAP are cost effective from that broader societal perspective—as a public policy, they make sense.
The study released Tuesday simply ignores those other multiple benefits, and does not quantify them in the analysis. This methodological flaw pre-ordains the conclusion.
The straw man problem is compounded when the report suggests that WAP fails as a “means to fight climate change.” While the program does produce some CO 2 reduction benefits, these are just a bit of frosting on the benefits cake. No one would suggest WAP should be considered as entirely, or even primarily, a mechanism to fight climate change. Yet the study disingenuously reports that the cost of WAP as a carbon reduction strategy is $329 per ton, by loading all the costs of the program onto the CO2 benefit as though there were no other benefits, and that the program was only being done to reduce CO2—a ridiculous premise.
Dangerous overgeneralization
The second (and unforgivable) fundamental flaw is that the study generalizes from an extremely limited sample. From one sample in one state, EPIC makes the leap to claiming that seemingly all “residential energy efficiency investments are double the benefit.”
In contrast, several national studies have examined the costs of residential energy efficiency programs across dozens of states and have found them to be highly cost effective; however, low-income programs have higher costs on a per-kWh basis. For example, in a recent study, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) finds that the cost of low income programs average 14 cents per kWh, compared to all residential programs at 3.3 cents per kWh. ACEEE’s most recent review of energy efficiency program costs similarly found that average cost per saved kWh from residential and low-income programs combined across 9 states was 3.7 cents/kWh. This is less than half the cost of electricity from a new power plant, and obviously very cost effective. And without including any monetized value for CO2 reductions, the CO2 reductions are essentially a ""free"" extra benefit.
In short, this study cherry-picked the worst possible program for comparing total costs to just direct energy savings, then set up a straw man to knock down, then tried to suggest, from an extremely limited sample of one program type, that all “residential energy efficiency investments” are suspect.
Cherry-picking
I should note one additional factor that really exacerbates the “cherry-picked” issue, and which I’ve not seen mentioned in any other discussion. This study looked at the WAP during the “stimulus package” years. As someone who was directly involved with one of the biggest “Better Buildings” pilots in the nation during that time period, I can tell you that the WAP was extremely stressed at the time, with tremendous pressure to push money out to the field. Job creation was at least as big a goal as energy savings, and they were functioning with a lot of new and inexperienced employees in order to handle the huge increase in funding and the deadlines to get it spent. I was there, on the ground, in Michigan at the time, and I know for a fact that the stimulus package demands on the system drove up the average cost per home in the program, in an effort to “get the money spent.” This would naturally tend to diminish the apparent cost effectiveness in terms of energy savings per dollar spent. This “stimulus package” distortion of the WAP during the years of the study further discredits any leap to generalize results to the “normal” program, much less to other examples of “residential energy efficiency investments.”
The real motive behind the study
Given the affiliation of the authors with E2e, one suspects that an important motive at play here is to make the case for the neo-classical economists’ preferred climate policy: so-called “market-based” approaches such as a carbon tax. Indeed, they explicitly argue for that as an alternate policy approach in both their press release and the accompanying policy brief. ACEEE supports the concept of a carbon tax. But it should be seen as a complement to, not a replacement for, traditional energy efficiency programs.
Viewed in the proper context, this new report could be seen as an interesting study to add to the large volume of energy efficiency program evaluations conducted over the years. The study does identify some problems with this particular program, but they can be easily addressed. For example, the energy audits conducted do not appear to have been calibrated with actual energy usage for each home, and thus baseline energy use and the amount of energy saved were overestimated. A study in New York found that such calibration, among other steps, improved the accuracy of energy savings estimates from 60% to 90%.
However, if taken out of context and generalized way beyond any justification, this new E2e working paper could be misused to attack critically important energy efficiency policies and programs. The data on the cost-effectiveness of residential energy efficiency programs are robust and extensively documented. Hopefully, well-informed policymakers and reporters will prevent any misuse of the study.
Postscript
It should be noted that one of the co-authors of the study, in an interview with the Washington Post, properly acknowledged that the study results should not be generalized. Meredith Fowlie, an associate professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, was quoted by the Post as saying: “This is one study in one state looking at one subpopulation and one type of measure,” she says. “I would not feel comfortable generalizing from our study in Michigan.”

Why everyone benefits from energy efficiency programs;"Opponents of energy efficiency often make the claim that the only people who benefit from utility energy efficiency programs are program participants. Any energy efficiency improvements those participants are making, they argue, are simply being subsidized by non-participants. Our study finds that is not true; all utility system customers benefit from energy efficiency investment. In our new report, Everyone Benefits: Practices and Recommendations for Utility-System Benefits of Energy Efficiency , we explore the wide range of advantages energy efficiency programs provide to the utility system as a whole and to all customers in that system.
Reducing costs for utilities benefits all customers
Our review of utility system benefits revealed a wide range of substantial benefits beyond those typically included, such as avoided cost of producing energy and building power plants. Utilities are also able to save money by not building new power lines, substations, and transformers. These avoided costs are substantial and real benefits of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency can also reduce a utility’s cost of complying with major state and federal environmental rules, lower wholesale energy costs by reducing demand, and reduce major risks faced by utilities for costly projects like buying natural gas or building power plants.
Why do we want to reduce all these costs for a utility? Reducing utility costs in these areas is important because they will reduce electric rates for all customers. Utilities are allowed to charge customers only for real costs they incur. If they reduce those costs, they will have to charge customers less money for service.
Most states aren’t including all the benefits in their analysis
In our review of utility system benefits, we found that most states and utilities aren’t including all of the benefits when deciding which programs to offer. Many states lack a coherent policy governing which utility system benefits should be included in cost effectiveness testing and how to calculate those benefits (a problem we also see in participant and societal benefits). This leads to many utilities and jurisdictions omitting relevant benefits in cost effectiveness screening, thereby leaving cost-effective energy efficiency—and significant cost savings—on the table. Such omissions lead to inefficient resource allocation and higher costs for everyone.
Moving forward
In our report we offer specific recommendations on how program administrators should calculate benefits, including properly measuring the value of energy savings at different times of the day and year, accounting for differences in short- and long-term costs, and choosing a discount rate that reflects reduced utility risk for energy efficiency. We also recommend including all of the relevant benefits in program screening. These are real benefits that reduce utility costs for everyone in the system.
While some are harder to determine, our review of state practices found that most benefits have been quantified by at least one state. Other states could learn from these studies how to include estimates of those benefits. It’s no accident that the states with the most coherent policy for determining benefits are more often those capturing the most cost effective energy efficiency.
We hope states are able to use the report as a guide to capture all utility system benefits of energy efficiency. Our report finds that a great opportunity exists to improve the inclusion of these benefits. Doing so would increase the level of cost effective energy efficiency and reduce rates for all utility customers.

Did EIA underestimate the role of energy efficiency in the Clean Power Plan?;"In May, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) released an analysis looking at the impacts of EPA’s proposed Clean Power Plan (CPP). The overall EIA analysis finds that the goals in the CPP can be met, with energy efficiency, renewable energy and switching from coal to gas generation all playing a significant role, but with switching to natural gas playing the dominant role. The changes will increase electricity prices 3-7% in the 2020-2025 period relative to a reference case, but by 2030, electricity prices in the CPP and reference cases will be similar in most regions. However, due to the influence of energy efficiency in reducing consumption, energy bills will increase by less than energy prices. By 2030, energy bills are about 1% higher and by 2040 energy bills will be slightly lower under the CPP than in the reference case.
In order to incorporate energy efficiency into its analysis, EIA had to collect some new data and refine its models. Prior to now it was very difficult for EIA to incorporate many energy efficiency policies into its analyses. We commend EIA for undertaking the effort to better include energy efficiency in their modeling. In our view, though, this remains a work in progress, and we trust that EIA will continue to refine its models.
Did EIA count all efficiency opportunities available?
In its analysis, EIA found that increased energy efficiency will reduce US electricity use for buildings by 2.6% in 2030 (1.8% decline in total US consumption), due mostly to utility rebate programs. EIA did not include expanded industrial efficiency into its CPP analysis. EIA also did not incorporate such policies as increased building codes and or expansion of combined heat and power (CHP) beyond the base case assumptions into its CPP analysis. A recent ACEEE report found that if states fully incorporate several energy efficiency policies into their CPP plans (e.g., energy saving targets for utilities, building codes and CHP), energy efficiency could reduce electricity consumption by about 25% relative to 2012 electricity sales, or about 22% relative to projected 2030 sales. That’s more than ten times what EIA found.
Why the big difference?
There appear to be two major factors accounting for the difference between the EIA and ACEEE analyses. First, EIA only considers a subset of available energy efficiency actions. It just considers utility programs affecting buildings, and only looks at some specific efficiency measures incorporated into its models, such as more efficient lighting, water heating, refrigeration and heating and cooling systems. Increasingly, energy efficiency programs are looking beyond simple equipment upgrades, but these efforts are not captured in the EIA models (see ACEEE’s 2013 report on next generation programs). Furthermore, EIA looked only at technologies widely available today and did not consider the evolution of new technologies in the future.
Second, EIA did not count existing utility energy efficiency program efforts to the extent they are already incorporated into their reference case forecast. The reference case forecast incorporates historical trends, which, in their CPP report, EIA estimates to be savings of 0.5% of utility sales each year. Over EIA’s ten-year analysis period, this means about 5% savings that EIA has in their 2030 baseline and not in their CPP case. Thus the difference between the EIA and ACEEE analyses is more like a factor of three: ACEEE’s 22% savings vs. EIA’s approximately 7% savings (1.8% plus 5%).
Bottom line
It’s good that EIA is working to better incorporate energy efficiency, but there’s substantially more efficiency available to states for their CPP compliance plans than is included in EIA’s initial analysis.

The Phase 2 truck fuel efficiency proposal is heading in the right direction, but has a few miles to go;"The fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards proposed today by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation would mean major gains in fuel efficiency for heavy-duty vehicles by 2027. The standards would deliver savings at the pump to truck owners and operators while reducing freight costs for businesses and for American families. The heavy-duty program is also a key element of the president’s climate action plan.
Yet the proposal falls short of what this program could and should achieve. ACEEE and others called for a 40% average fuel consumption reduction by 2025, relative to 2010 levels. Our first take is that the proposed standards would deliver a 36% reduction. The engine standards, in particular, appear to be weak, achieving only about 4% fuel savings, when they should be achieving over 10%. The purpose of having a separate engine standard is to set a high bar with a long lead-time, giving manufacturers the certainty to invest in major new technologies, like waste heat recovery. A 4% reduction in a decade just won’t do the job.
The proposal looks stronger in other areas, as in the standards for heavy-duty pickups and vans, though still a bit shy of achievable levels. It also fills some big gaps in the existing standards. Trailers will be brought into the program in 2018, which will reduce fuel consumption by up to 8%. Transmission efficiency and powertrain integration will be credited under the new program, another significant step forward.
We’ll be supporting timely finalization of the rule while seeking to shore up the weaker elements of the proposal during the comment period. Previously adopted heavy-duty fuel efficiency standards have already helped US companies to advance their leadership globally in truck and engine efficiency technologies, and a strong rule for the second phase of the program will help them consolidate that advantage.

ASAP, AHRI, and ACEEE Applaud Successful Negotiated Rulemaking for Commercial Air Conditioners and Warm Air Furnaces;"Working Group Reaches Consensus on Energy Conservation Standards
Arlington, Va.—The Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) today applauded the success of the Commercial Package Air Conditioners and Commercial Warm Air Furnaces Working Group, established by the US Department of Energy on April 1, to negotiate conservation standards for these products. After six meetings, the working group, comprised of industry, energy efficiency and environmental advocates, contractors and agency representatives, including ACEEE, AHRI, and ASAP, reached consensus and provided recommendations for energy conservation standards, test procedures, and metrics.
“Negotiated rulemaking are our preferred method for establishing energy conservation standards for covered products and equipment,” said AHRI president and CEO Stephen Yurek. “Bringing stakeholders together to develop a rule that is both effective and achievable is the best way to ensure that our members’ products and equipment provide consumers and businesses with comfort, safety, and productivity while helping the nation achieve its energy reduction targets,” he said.
“This negotiated outcome will provide huge energy and economic benefits for the nation,” said ASAP executive director Andrew deLaski. “DOE, industry, and all the participants deserve credit for coming up with an approach that delivers those important national benefits and works for industry.”
""By every measure, this is the biggest efficiency standards rulemaking in DOE's history,"" said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. ""Over 30 years of sales, businesses from big box stores to commercial building owners will net savings of nearly $50 billion, while the nation will see energy reductions equal to all the coal burned in US power plants in one year.""
The committee was established under the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee (ASRAC) in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the Negotiated Rulemaking Act. Specifically, the group was tasked with addressing rules for the energy efficiency of commercial package air conditioners and heat pumps (specifically, air-cooled with rated cooling capacities greater than or equal to 65,000 Btu per hour and less than 760,000 Btu per hour split and package AC and HP) and commercial warm air furnaces, as authorized by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975, as amended. The scope excluded package terminal air conditioners and heat pumps (PTAC/PTHP), single package vertical units (SPVU), computer room air conditioners (CRAC), and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems.

States don't need to gamble with EPA rulemaking. Energy efficiency can achieve two-thirds or more of Clean Power Plan targets;"A number of state leaders have gone all in, suing the EPA for a rule it hasn't even finalized yet. We've seen a first draft of EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan, but the final rule could change dramatically. One thing that EPA won't change, though, is the language in the Clean Air Act that requires this rulemaking. That language came from Congress, and luckily for states, it provides a great deal of discretion to them to determine how to meet EPA's final performance standards.
This is a jackpot for states. It means that their first and best options remain on the table, regardless of how the final rule gets shuffled. We used a new ACEEE tool to determine that two-thirds of EPA's proposed emission reductions for the nation can be met with the adoption of just three common efficiency policies. The graph below compares the reduction in nationwide emission rates that would be required by the draft rule in 2030 (39%) with the national emission rate reduction that could be achieved through a few select efficiency policies (27%).
States have a lot of experience with these three policies, but there are many more options they can draw from. The goals that EPA sets for states vary widely and some states will have significantly more to do than others. Regardless of EPA’s goals, energy efficiency will be the best play for most states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector at the lowest possible cost. Reducing energy waste and improving technologies so that we use less to accomplish more will position states so that other investments they make will be even more affordable. For example, some states may decide to reduce emissions by building new, cleaner generation. While this can be an attractive option, it can also be expensive. Deploying energy efficiency options first reduces the amount of new generation that is needed, thereby reducing the costs of building new facilities.
EPA staffers are under the gun to get a final rule published in time for summer, but ultimately the stakes are highest for states. Luckily, huge amounts of untapped energy efficiency potential means states have an ace in the hole that will help them to provide clean, reliable and affordable energy.

2025 CAFE standards under the microscope;"A report released today by the National Research Council (NRC) provides important input to the upcoming “midterm evaluation” of fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards now in place. The 600-page report, Cost, Effectiveness and Deployment of Fuel Economy Technologies for Light-Duty Vehicles reviews the work done by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) leading to the 2012 adoption of standards raising fuel economy to a nominal 54.5 miles per gallon on average in 2025. I served on the committee that wrote the report, which found the agencies’ analysis to be “thorough and of high caliber on the whole.” Some notable points beyond what’s in the report summary:
NRC estimates of technology effectiveness and cost are comparable to the agencies’ for most technologies.
The report provides estimates of effectiveness and cost of the technologies considered by the agencies in developing the standards. After some culling and aggregation to facilitate display, I show in the figure below how the committee’s estimates of technology cost-effectiveness compare to the agencies’. For each technology listed on the left, the length of a bar represents the ratio of committee estimates to agency estimates of cost per percent fuel consumption reduction. Committee members did not always agree amongst themselves on the best estimate, so the report provides two cost and/or two effectiveness values for many technologies. In the figure, the upper bars (blue) reflect the committee’s higher effectiveness and lower cost values, and the lower bars (red) reflect the committee’s lower effectiveness and higher cost values. The large number of bars with lengths close to 1 indicates substantial agreement with the agencies in most technology categories—though not all—with differences of under 20% for the most part.
NRC and Agency Cost-Effectiveness Comparable for Most Technologies

Source: Data from NRC Report, Tables S.1, S.2, S.1a, S.2c
Mass reduction and transmissions stand out as areas of significant difference between the NRC and agency estimates. For transmissions, the committee found lower potential fuel savings than the agencies did in moving from 6-speed to 8-or-more-speed and shift optimization. Hence transmissions will be a key area to revisit during the midterm evaluation, and indeed EPA’s technical work for the review includes extensive benchmarking of vehicles with advanced transmissions and exploring what can be achieved through better shift logic.
The committee found several other efficiency technologies that may help manufacturers improve fuel economy but that were not included in the agencies’ analysis, and hence do not appear in the figure above.
Mass reduction cost projection is difficult.
Reducing vehicle mass is widely viewed as a key strategy to improve fuel economy, and one to which manufacturers are already devoting substantial effort. The committee found that “the uncertainty surrounding the cost of mass reduction is particularly large.” At levels of mass reduction of 10% or below, the agencies’ cost estimate falls between the higher and lower NRC estimates. The lower estimate reflects the view that modest reductions in mass can be achieved at no cost. But for high levels of mass reduction, the committee projected costs much higher than the agencies’. The committee nonetheless predicted that manufacturers will reduce mass by 20% or more in large vehicles, motivated both by the need to improve fuel economy and by other benefits of reducing mass, such as the ability to increase towing and load capacities without any modifications to the power train. So, even if these higher costs were realized, part of the cost would have to be chalked up to meeting market demand for attributes other than fuel economy.
A midsize car meets the 2025 fuel economy target with a conventional power train.
The committee didn’t estimate the overall cost to comply with the standards; that would have required finding technology packages to reach the appropriate fuel economy target for every vehicle model sold and applying fleet averaging, off-cycle credits, advanced technology credits, and other flexibilities the program puts at manufacturers’ disposal. However, the report does show an illustrative technology pathway to meet the 2025 fuel economy target starting with a 2008 midsize car with an I4 engine and a footprint (area defined by the tires’ contact points with the ground) of 46.6 square feet. The vehicle met its 2025 target without transitioning to an electrified powertrain.
The cost of the technologies to reach the target was $1,181, using the committee’s lower cost and higher effectiveness estimates, and $1,658 using its higher cost and lower effectiveness estimates. (This is direct cost, i.e., without retail markup.) By comparison, using the agencies’ technology effectiveness and cost numbers, it would cost $1,060 to reach the fuel economy target—not significantly different from the committee’s lower cost scenario. Even the committee’s higher cost estimate is much closer to the agency number than fuel economy skeptics’ estimates have been in the past. 
And most importantly, these estimates do not reflect the full range of efficiency technologies under development.
Technology innovation can further reduce the cost of meeting 2025 targets.
The committee identified several technologies that were not included in the compliance scenario the agencies developed in setting the standards; for example, high compression ratio engines, electrically assisted superchargers, dedicated exhaust gas recirculation, and ethanol boosted direct injection engines. And it’s a safe bet that other technologies not considered either by the agencies or by the committee will enter the market over the next decade. As the report states, “these unanticipated innovations may permit the industry to meet emission standards at lower than predicted cost.”
Thus far, fuel efficiency technologies in current vehicles are outperforming projections.
Comparing some high-selling 2014 vehicles to their 2008 counterparts, the committee found that the agencies’ estimates of the effectiveness of fuel efficiency technologies were realized, and in some cases exceeded. For example, the package of technologies applied to a Honda Accord achieved a 24% greater reduction in fuel consumption from 2008 to 2014 than the agencies projected would result from that package.
All in all, the NRC report provides strong evidence of the soundness of the CAFE standards out to 2025. The report highlights a few areas that will especially benefit from additional agency scrutiny in the midterm review. It also points to emerging technology opportunities that could reduce the cost of compliance with the 2025 standards, or alternatively allow vehicles to go beyond those standards to reach even higher fuel economy levels.

Making all the benefits of multifamily retrofits count;"Energy efficiency retrofits for multifamily buildings offer a host of benefits beyond energy savings to building owners and tenants. The problem is that efficiency programs that spur investment in this kind of work are not always assessed fairly. In our new report, Multiple Benefits of Multifamily Energy Efficiency for Cost-Effectiveness Screening, we describe the wide range of benefits resulting from multifamily efficiency retrofits and provide solutions for how to establish their value and include them in regulatory testing, for fairer assessment of multifamily efficiency programs by regulators.
Energy efficient buildings have benefits beyond energy savings
Key to a multifamily building owner’s bottom line is keeping vacancy and turnover rates low. Many savvy building owners realize that energy efficiency retrofits to their buildings can lead to a host of other benefits beyond energy savings that help their bottom line. When tenants are more comfortable and have lower, more manageable utility bills, they don't move as often. Apartments that stay warm and cozy in the winter, instead of cold and drafty, are easier to rent out and have lower vacancy rates. Heating and cooling systems that function properly and don’t break down as often result in lower maintenance costs and fewer tenant complaints. In short, when building owners are deciding to do an energy efficiency retrofit project, they are making a number of considerations about how the work impacts the satisfaction of tenants, and thus how the work impacts their business.
The problem with cost-effectiveness screening today
The problem is we aren’t doing a very good job when it comes to accounting for these benefits and including them in cost effectiveness screening. Despite growing recognition by those undertaking retrofit work in their buildings, and those designing and running multifamily programs, the multiple benefits that result from energy efficiency retrofits are not consistently accounted for in cost-effectiveness screening. Multifamily program administrators screen programs to determine whether the benefits of utility investments for energy efficiency improvements outweigh the costs. Most tests used by regulators to evaluate whole-building retrofits do not include the value of benefits beyond the cost of energy saved, even though the most widely used tests, like the Total Resource Cost test (TRC), are designed to include them. The result is that administrators balance all the costs of a program against only some of the benefits, and so they fail to capture the full value of energy efficiency improvements.
Incorporating the value of multiple benefits into cost effectiveness screening for these programs is important for scaling up programs that target savings in the multifamily sector, because the results of the tests are often used to compare efficiency programs to one another within a utility’s program portfolio. If the building owner’s project costs are not balanced by all the benefits, these programs don’t always stand up against other efficiency program investments.
Finding a solution
Our new report offers guidance on how program administrators can value the multiple benefits of energy efficiency, and incorporate them into cost-effectiveness screening. Drawing from a growing body of research that focuses on multifamily buildings, the report provides examples of the range of benefits and their values. In many cases, benefits experienced by building owners are already accounted for as part of their standard accounting practices, including maintenance and repair costs, and costs of other utilities (particularly water and delivered fuels). For benefits that are difficult to quantify and value, or that take extensive amounts of time and effort to assess, there are options to include rough estimates or adders to indicate a value in relation to the cost of energy saved, and validate with pre- and post-retrofit data collected when the program is administered. Benefits should not be omitted from cost-effectiveness testing because of a lack of precise data. Now it is time to balance the costs of energy efficiency improvements with all the benefits that result, so that projects and measures that represent cost-effective energy savings are not left on the table.

Johnson Controls teams up to scale energy efficiency in corporate supply chains;"American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy and other organizations participate in Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) America Commitment to Action
MILWAUKEE—Johnson Controls plans to scale up its innovative program to help small and medium-sized suppliers reduce energy use in their manufacturing facilities as a CGI America Commitment to Action.
The Scaling Energy Efficiency in Corporate Supply Chains CGI Commitment to Action expands an existing Johnson Controls supplier efficiency pilot program in which company energy experts visit the plants of its suppliers and train their in-house teams on identifying and implementing low-cost/no-cost energy efficiency improvement measures. The supplier training follows an industry practice known as “energy hunts” conducted for years by Johnson Controls at its own manufacturing plants around the world. Suppliers participating in the program typically achieve energy savings of 5 to 10 percent with less than a two year payback on their investments.
As part of the CGI Commitment to Action, Johnson Controls, a global multi industrial company, will support 60 additional suppliers over the next three years. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) will provide overall coordination of the commitment including recruiting manufacturing partners, gathering program results and reporting progress to CGI.
The Scaling Energy Efficiency in Corporate Supply Chains Commitment to Action was recognized yesterday during ceremonies at CGI America 2015 held in Denver, Colorado.
“Small and medium-sized suppliers often have limited resources and lack the expertise to investigate and implement resource efficiency improvements,” said Grady Crosby, vice president and chief diversity officer for Johnson Controls. “We are pleased the Clinton Global Initiative has recognized this program to help the manufacturing sector reduce energy consumption which translates into lower operating costs and increased competitiveness for American businesses.”
“ACEEE research has identified the value of energy efficiency to small and medium-sized manufacturers, but also the challenges of limited expertise and staff resources need to realize savings,” said Steve Nadel, executive director of ACEEE. “Large companies have proved that sharing expertise with their suppliers is an effective strategy for generating savings and improving the productivity and financial stability of both companies, thereby creating quality jobs.”
Other organizations supporting the commitment to action includes the U.S. Department of Energy and the Institute for Industrial Productivity which will share best practices, tools, and expertise while helping recruit additional manufacturing partners. The World Resources Institute will provide advice and support to the project while the Natural Resources Defense Council will serve as an advisor in the area of supply chain programs and supporting policies.

How to make the utility of the future an energy-efficient one: New ACEEE report series charts the course for aligning utility business models and energy efficiency;"Utilities have traditionally earned profits by simply selling more energy and building more power plants and infrastructure, which put their financial motivations squarely at odds with the goal of greater energy efficiency. Luckily, that business model has started to change, which is good news for the nation’s economy, environment, and for consumers who want more options for saving energy in their homes and businesses. With the proper regulatory tools in place, utilities’ financial motivations can be aligned with energy efficiency outcomes. As regulators, utilities, and other stakeholders begin to consider utility business models for the 21st century, they can look to recent state experience for insight into how to effectively incorporate energy efficiency as a utility system resource.
ACEEE has been researching this issue for years, and today we are releasing a series of three new reports on a range of topics related to utility business models and energy efficiency. We examined practices state by state across the United States, interviewed stakeholders for case studies of several state examples, and documented lessons learned. Here is a snapshot of our key findings:
First in the series is a paper that Marty Kushler and I wrote, titled Policies Matter: Creating a Foundation for an Energy-Efficient Utility of the Future. The paper does two things. First, it describes the comprehensive foundation of tools necessary for energy efficiency to thrive as a resource for a utility of the future. Second, it analyzes actual energy savings performance compared to the set of policies in place. In our 2011 report series on the same topics, we described the “three-legged stool” necessary to align utility business models and energy efficiency with three types of tools: program direct-cost recovery, decoupling or related mechanisms that allow recovery of lost contributions to fixed costs, and earnings opportunities for efficiency investments through performance incentives.
Our new analysis shows that while these three regulatory tools play a crucial role in elevating the interest in efficiency within utility companies, these alone have not been as successful at saving energy as states’ specific, long-term energy efficiency targets. For example, we have found that only states with an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS) have achieved annual savings of at least 1% of electricity sales. Our new analysis quantitatively shows that a comprehensive strategy—getting the business model right and setting specific efficiency targets—is most closely associated with achieving high savings. Such a strategy is essential to sustaining long-term utility interest in capturing cost-effective energy efficiency resources.
The next two reports take a deeper look at two legs of the stool. The second paper, Beyond Carrots for Utilities: A National Review of Performance Incentives for Energy Efficiency updates our analysis from 2011 on utility shareholder performance incentives for energy efficiency. In 2011, we identified and examined 18 states with this type of policy in place. This time our research team, led by Seth Nowak, found that 25 states have energy efficiency performance incentives for utilities or statewide program implementers, and two more states have the policy framework but have not yet implemented incentives. While the type and structure of the incentives varies significantly from state to state, in general, we identified a few noteworthy trends. We found that incentives are increasingly awarded based on specific energy savings-based targets. They’re also becoming more comprehensive, often requiring utilities to meet performance goals for multiple types of metrics to earn an incentive.
We also found that today incentives are more likely to be based on longer-term performance criteria. Overall, we found that performance incentives are working well to elevate the interest within utilities to invest in energy efficiency and to encourage utilities to meet or exceed their energy savings targets. Check out the twelve case studies included in the report for more background, policy details, and performance results on state experience with performance incentives.
Third, Annie Gilleo led the research for the second report coming out today, Valuing Efficiency: A Review of Lost Revenue Adjustment Mechanisms. LRAM is a rate adjustment mechanism that allows a utility to recover revenues that are reduced specifically as a result of energy efficiency programs. Though LRAM is meant to address the utility’s throughput incentive, i.e., the traditional link between more sales and profits, it does not completely remove that link. That’s because LRAM is typically not symmetrical, in that while a utility can recover lost revenues from efficiency programs, regulators do not typically make downward rate adjustments if the utility sells more energy than predicted. Full revenue decoupling does a better job of removing that link. LRAM also differs from decoupling in that it requires a utility to specifically estimate energy savings over a given time period.
In recent years, many states adopted the LRAM approach. Our research identified 17 states that have LRAMs in place for at least one major utility. While the number of states with this policy has increased in recent years, we also found that several states that had LRAM policies in the past have moved toward decoupling. This is not surprising, given that we found that states face numerous challenges and complexities with implementing LRAM. In particular, states with LRAM often struggle with the increased focus on evaluation, measurement, and verification of savings. Timing is also a critical issue because LRAM intertwines issues commonly dealt with in rate cases and efficiency proceedings, making it important to line up timing of these two processes. More frequent rate cases are also necessary to prevent lost revenue from stacking up over time. More importantly, an LRAM doesn’t fully address the throughput incentive. Utilities may be willing to do efficiency, but they still have an incentive to sell more energy. Because so many states struggle with these issues, we find that LRAM can be an acceptable temporary solution on the way to decoupling, but for several reasons is a less than optimal approach. Where possible, we recommend true symmetrical decoupling.
Energy efficiency has an important and large potential role to play in the utility of the future, but that outcome is highly dependent on a mix of policies that align utility business models with energy efficiency. As states look to the future, we hope they build on lessons already learned to create a comprehensive policy approach that gets the business model right for efficiency and sets specific, long-term efficiency targets. Check out our new report series for more information, and stay tuned for an ACEEE webinar on these reports coming in July!

CHP can help states meet their Clean Power Plan targets, and here’s how;"Emissions reductions from combined heat and power (CHP) can help states comply with their obligations under EPA’s proposed Clean Power Plan. ACEEE has released a step-by-step guide to help states do just that. ACEEE’s new CHP template is intended to help states understand how to document and claim emissions reductions that result from CHP measures in their state plans. This topic and other issues related to the role of CHP in the Clean Power Plan will be discussed at the Industrial Energy Technology Conference in New Orleans tomorrow.
As an underutilized resource with the potential for increased deployment in every state of the nation, CHP can be a component in a state’s plan for cost-effectively reducing emissions from the US power sector. ACEEE has estimated that CHP can conservatively contribute more than 68 million megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity savings nationwide in the year 2030, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 46 million metric tons.
What’s more, obtaining credit for CHP in a state compliance plan is an additional benefit from something that is already a good economic development investment. CHP facilities help local businesses and manufacturers save money and boost their productivity and provide local communities with increased reliability and safety during electric grid outages. States should consider CHP as a tool for attracting businesses and building more resilient communities, with the added benefit of offering cost-effective emissions reductions that can help with Clean Power Plan compliance.
This CHP template is the third in a series of templates available on our 111(d) webpage to help states incorporate energy efficiency strategies into their plans for compliance. The series also includes templates focused on building energy codes and energy efficiency financing programs. To get an idea of just how much CHP could help your state toward achieving its Clean Power Plan emissions reduction target, and at what cost, check out ACEEE’s State and Utility Pollution Reduction (SUPR) Calculator.

Energy efficiency at stake in the Keystone State;"There’s a flurry of activity surrounding energy savings goals in Pennsylvania, and what it will mean for energy efficiency will depend on decisions by both regulators and legislators. Pennsylvania first set energy savings goals in 2008, with its Act 129 legislation. The state is now at a key juncture, with the public utility commission (PUC) making a decision soon on the next round of targets. Separately, the state legislature introduced legislation last week that would allow industrial customers to opt-out of Act 129’s successful programs.
Before really digging in to the details of what’s currently at stake, it’s important to understand that Pennsylvania’s energy savings goals have two major constraints under the requirements of Act 129.
First, there is a firm cap on how much utilities are able to spend on efficiency during a given year. The cost cap artificially limits energy efficiency spending well below what is cost effective, and shifts discussion away from ways to maximize long-term savings and toward ways to minimize acquisition costs. It also forces stakeholders and utilities to make difficult trade-offs. An increase in spending on one program equals less dollars going to another.
Second, Pennsylvania is one of the few states where utilities face penalties should they fail to reach their savings targets. In theory, penalties make utilities accountable for meeting targets. In practice, they mean utilities are less likely to take risks, try new program designs, and spend on comprehensive programs.
With these two constraints set by the original legislation, stakeholders have been working diligently to maximize the impact of programs through the regulatory process. The PUC issued a tentative order on March 11, proposing savings targets to be achieved over the next five years. The Tentative Order also included a host of other proposals – everything from accounting methods for savings to low-income program requirements and demand response program design. More than 20 stakeholder groups responded to the commission’s proposal, including utilities, industrial customers, cities, low-income advocates, and clean energy groups. Now, the commission is in the process of weighing these varied responses. And in doing so, they’ve got some big questions to answer.
Did they get the targets right? In the tentative order, the commission proposed targets equivalent to about 0.85% incremental electricity savings per year. They came to this target based on analysis by the independent statewide evaluator that took the cost cap into account when looking at savings potential. However, in comments we assisted the Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance in preparing, we point out that far more savings could be achievable if the commission considers cost-saving options and new program designs, and consider the historical precedent of over-achievement of goals in Pennsylvania.
What counts? With spending capped, this is a biggie. The commission will have to consider whether utilities that have racked up extra savings in Phase II can roll those savings into Phase III. (We say if you’re going to roll them over, consider raising overall targets to account for these “zero cost” savings!) How utilities will keep track of new savings is also at issue. The commission proposed a cumulative accounting method, whereby measures whose useful lives are shorter than the length of the phase don’t count toward the final target (unless they’re re-installed). Ultimately, the commission should consider the most effective way to keep programs running continuously throughout the phase. To that end, we proposed counting incremental savings achieved over the course of the phase. This should encourage utilities to keep programs running throughout the entirety of the phase, rather than turning programs on and off to meet a goal in the final year. Our research on energy savings goals has found that most states set incremental targets, making it easier to track progress over individual years.
Where should utilities focus programs? The commission proposed a portfolio of programs that focuses on all sectors, with specific savings goals for programs serving low-income customers. Ultimately, the most important thing is that utility portfolios offer a comprehensive array of programs to benefit all customer classes. In the tentative order, state regulators indicated the importance of providing programs to all customer classes. But recently, the discussion of whether all customers should be offered programs has moved into the state legislature as well. State Senator Lisa Boscola recently introduced the Large Commercial and Industrial Opt-Out of Act 129. This bill would significantly undermine energy efficiency advancements made in Pennsylvania to date, allowing large customers to opt out of contributing to efficiency programs. Allowing large consumers to opt out has two problems. First, large-consumer energy savings tend to be lower-cost than are savings from other sectors, particularly important in view of the cost cap. Secondly, energy efficiency is a resource that benefits all users, so energy efficiency deployed anywhere in a system benefits everyone. Allowing large customers to ""go it alone"" and not participate in Act 129 programs would eliminate a proven low-cost resource. The bill would lead to lower overall energy savings and higher costs for all ratepayers (including the very customers leading the opt-out charge).
Big decisions need to be made in the Keystone State. Rather than building an additional barrier to energy efficiency, state legislators should consider ways they can support regulators in increasing energy and bill savings for Pennsylvanians. Regulators, meanwhile, must focus on the details. With proper guidance, utilities can deliver deeper savings to residents and businesses across the state, setting up a long-term strategy for success.

How energy efficiency financing can help states meet Clean Power Plan goals;"EPA’s final rule for regulating greenhouse gases from existing power plants, the Clean Power Plan, is anticipated later this summer. With just 12 months to develop compliance plans, states will have to scramble to identify their most reliable, lowest cost compliance options. In addition, they will have to find funds to pay for it all.
Building new, cleaner generation is typically funded through increases in electricity rates. Utility-run energy efficiency programs are often funded this way as well. There are other options, though. Energy efficiency financing can leverage public and private sources of funding to remove some of the typical barriers to investments in new technologies—namely, by spreading upfront investment costs into smaller payments over time.
Today, ACEEE is releasing the second in a series of step-by-step guides that help states claim emissions reductions resulting from energy efficiency programs and policies. Navigating the Clean Power Plan: A Template for Including Energy Efficiency Finance Programs in State Compliance Plans is focused on helping states incorporate financing programs and policies into their plans for complying with the EPA Clean Power Plan. The tool provides an overview of some types of financing approaches that may be well suited for Clean Power Plan compliance. (For those interested in learning about some of the best financing options out there, consider the Energy Efficiency Finance Forum coming at the end of the month.)
Additionally, the tool highlights program and policy design aspects that states should weigh, and a discussion of issues that may need to be addressed in a compliance plan submission. For those interested in digging a bit deeper, the tool also includes a hypothetical submission to EPA based on a real-world financing program in Ohio.
Greater Cincinnati Property Assessed Clean Energy, or “GC-PACE,” is modeled after PACE programs around the country and serves the state of Ohio. Essentially the PACE model allows building owners to finance efficiency and renewable energy improvements through a voluntary assessment on their property tax bill. Loans are secured by a lien on the property, so long-term funding can be raised from the private sector. The City of Cincinnati is the lead sponsoring municipality, and the program relies on a partnership between the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority and the Greater Cincinnati Energy Alliance.
This is a great example of how localities can play a critical role in state compliance planning. The GC-PACE financing mechanism eliminates the upfront costs of energy improvement projects, a common barrier to the implementation of energy efficiency. Commercial and industrial building owners can obtain financing for clean energy improvements to their buildings by opting to add the financed cost of the improvements to a special property tax assessment on their property.
No single program or policy is likely to be the magic pill that gets a state all the way to compliance. Rather, states will likely need a suite of measures to achieve EPA’s goals. We will continue to support states in thinking through their options in the coming months. For more tools like this template, see our first in the series on building codes. Check back here next week for a brand new template on how to obtain credit for combined heat and power in a state compliance plan.

How a missing word and a few misguided bills could undermine Maine’s energy future;"Who knew an “and” could unravel everything? In Maine, we’re seeing just how much damage three missing letters can do.
In 2013, the Maine legislature passed the Omnibus Energy Act, stabilizing funding for the energy efficiency programs led by the state’s third-party administrator, the Efficiency Maine Trust. The law raised the amount of funds going to Efficiency Maine, setting spending requirements as a percentage of retail and transmission and distribution sales. The problem? Despite the clear intent of the legislation, a drafting error left out the “and,” leaving the door open for state regulators to reduce energy efficiency program budgets by nearly $40 million by capping efficiency spending based on just a portion of sales.
The Omnibus Energy Bill was an important step for a state with a shaky past when it comes to energy efficiency. In our State Scorecard, Maine ranked 12th overall in 2011. Just a year later, Maine fell 13 spots in our rankings to 25th, farther than any other state. This drop was largely due to the significant defunding of Efficiency Maine. But in 2013, Maine was back on track because of the Omnibus Energy Bill, and was one of the most improved states in our Scorecard.
Today the future looks uncertain again. Earlier this year, two out of the three Maine public service commissioners took advantage of a missing three-letter word in the Omnibus Energy Bill to slash efficiency funding (and confirmed their decision just this week with another 2-1 vote). State legislators were swift to respond with a quick-fix bill that would add the “and” back into the legislation as originally intended. But the floodgates have opened and, with Governor LePage indicating he would not support the quick-fix bill, a host of other bills have been introduced that would further undermine the state’s successful energy efficiency programs.
LePage is backing a package of bills that, taken together, would dismantle a large part of Maine’s energy efficiency programs. The first bill , LD 1221, takes advantage of the need for the simple grammatical correction to give the governor more control over Efficiency Maine by making its executive director his political appointee.
Even more troubling for the future of energy efficiency in Maine is LD 1398, which would drastically cut the number of Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative dollars invested in energy efficiency programs that reduce heating fuel usage and energy bills for businesses. These programs are some of the most cost effective in Efficiency Maine’s portfolio, delivering more than $5 in savings for every $1 invested. In 2013, the legislature unanimously rejected a similar proposal by Governor LePage’s administration.
Another bill submitted as part of the same package could nearly eliminate energy efficiency funding for industrial customers (LD 1400). While this bill would have immediate implications for manufacturers and large commercial and industrial customers who are struggling to lower costs, its effects will also ripple out to the rest of Maine. Energy efficiency is the cheapest way for utilities to meet demand, and a robust portfolio of programs and services should give all customers—from low and moderate-income residents to large manufacturers—ample opportunities to reduce their energy bills. Slashing investments in energy efficiency means everyone’s bills go up as utilities are forced to invest in more costly infrastructure options and peak power prices remain high.
In the coming weeks, Maine legislators will have a chance to stop these misguided bills in their tracks. They’ve stopped similar efforts to undermine efficiency before—the Omnibus Energy Bill passed in 2013 was an override of the governor’s veto. Keeping efficiency in play in Maine this time around will take similar legislative willpower. Placing tens of millions of efficiency dollars on the chopping block means putting at risk hundreds of millions of dollars of energy savings badly needed by consumers.

Projects for your pipeline: conferences and deal sourcing don’t have to be mutually exclusive;"In just a week and a half, ACEEE will be hosting its annual Energy Efficiency Finance Forum. There’s been a running joke in the energy efficiency financing industry for the past couple of years about the large ratio of conferences to deals. Maybe there's something to that, but over the past couple of months we've seen major shifts and increased activity throughout the marketplace that indicate a sea change may be in the offing. This makes us wonder, do conferences and deals have to be mutually exclusive?
The theme for our conference this year is A Critical Moment, and we'd like to seize this moment by seeing if we can bring some real business to the table. While we've suspected that all the networking that goes on at the Finance Forum has led to transactions and investments, we thought we’d try a little more direct matchmaking this year by formally introducing some great projects and programs to potential financiers.
That's why we're partnering with the Council for Development Finance Agencies (CDFA) to feature the CDFA Deal Room. This venue is the go-to place where investors and financiers can meet up with energy projects that are looking for financial backing. The Deal Room is open during the entire Finance Forum, with each of its 10 featured projects available for a full day, as well as projects being formally presented one at a time. Many of our presenters are bringing multiple projects to the table.
The full list of projects is available on the conference website. They're diverse in both their vision and their asks. For example, Treehouse Brokerage & Development is seeking $4.5 million for a zero-energy community at Sustainability Park (S*PARK) in Denver. NYCEEC is looking for investors for a $25 million secured credit facility. Modula S would like to find equity/project finance for a $55 million multifamily housing project featuring innovative modular construction.
And there's more! New World Connection needs help purchasing solar panels and electronics, install, and test charging stations in the amount of $20,000–$100,000. Green Cooling Tower Solutions is looking for $5–$50 million to perform cooling tower upgrades, convert traditional once-through cooling systems to closed-loop systems, and use salt water makeup for places like California. The Vermont Energy Investment Corporation would like $100,000 in seed capital. Their project combines net-zero modular homes and grid-interactive electric vehicles that can recharge from and supply power to the homes to reduce energy and build wealth for low-income homeowners.
Don’t miss your chance to meet these project owners and network with the speakers featured in our conference program. The Energy Efficiency Finance Forum takes place May 31–June 2 at the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco. Register online by May 26 for expedited check-in, or register on-site in San Francisco.

Boston, NYC, Washington, DC, San Francisco, and Seattle Rank as America’s Most Energy-Efficient US Cities;"Biennial Energy Efficiency Scorecard Ranks 51 Large US Cities; Balance of Top 10 US Cities: Chicago, Minneapolis, Portland, Austin, and Denver; Los Angeles One of the Most Improved Cities
Washington, DC—Mayors and local lawmakers in America’s largest cities continue to take innovative steps to lower energy costs for consumers and businesses, increase their resilience, and reduce pollution through increased energy efficiency, according to the 2nd edition of the City Energy Efficiency Scorecard, released today by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
Available online at http://aceee.org/local-policy/city-scorecard, the ACEEE report finds that Boston continues to be the most energy-efficient city in the nation, receiving 82 out of a possible 100 points, an improvement of more than five points from that city’s 2013 score. Trailing Boston, the top 10 US cities for energy efficiency are: New York City (#2), Washington, DC (#3), San Francisco (#4), Seattle (#5), Chicago (#6), Minneapolis (#7), Portland (#8), Austin (#9), and Denver (#10). With 9 of the top 10 cities improving their scores from 2013, Boston faced increased competition for the top spot.
Key findings in the 2015 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard include the following:
· Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Seattle are the most improved cities compared to the 2013 City Scorecard, with many showing double-digit improvements in their scores. Los Angeles, for example, established a strong energy savings goal, and Chicago enacted a new commercial building benchmarking ordinance.
· Other cities have also improved their scores since the last edition, including several in the Southeast United States. Atlanta, the leading city in the Southeast, saw an improvement of 5 points, earning new points for local government operations, buildings policies, energy and water utilities, and transportation policies. Charlotte made a strong showing as well, improving by nearly 8 points. Jacksonville, the lowest scoring city in the 2013 edition, saw a 50 percent increase in its score.
· All of the ranked cities, even the highest scorers, have significant room for improvement. Boston was the only city to earn over 80 points, and only 13 cities earned more than half of the possible points.
ACEEE research analyst David Ribeiro, the lead report author, said:
“Our findings show that cities continue to be laboratories of innovation when it comes to energy efficiency, with many pushing the envelope for more energy savings in the last few years. Cities are also improving their approaches when it comes to tracking and communicating their efforts to save energy. By capturing these efforts in the Scorecard we hope local leaders from cities of all sizes can learn best practices from each other and deliver the benefits of energy efficiency to their communities, such as a stronger economy and a cleaner environment.”
Martin J. Walsh, mayor of Boston said:
""It is an honor Boston has been recognized as America's most energy-efficient city. Our goal is to help Boston residents and businesses save energy and money, and through collaborative efforts with our utility partners, Eversource and National Grid, we are creating a thriving, healthy, and innovative Boston. I look forward to continuing these efforts for both our environment and residents.""
Muriel Bowser, mayor of the District of Columbia said:
""Being recognized as one of the top three most improved cities in ACEEE's City Energy Efficiency Scorecard shows that DC’s environmental policies are paying off. In the District, we know that being energy efficient is one of the most cost-effective ways to achieve our ambitious energy goals, cut carbon pollution, and create good paying jobs that put more residents on a pathway to the middle class. Simply put, energy efficiency is good for people, our communities, and the planet. The District of Columbia is thrilled to see our commitment to the triple bottom line highlighted by ACEEE.""
Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles said:
""I'm pleased to see that Los Angeles is one of the most-improved cities in the City Scorecard, with an increase of 20 points from last year. With the release of my Sustainable City pLAn and new bold goals for energy efficiency, transportation, and municipal operations, I am confident LA is on its way to the top of the list.""
Kasim Reed, mayor of Atlanta said:
“The City of Atlanta and its stakeholders are fully invested in making Atlanta a top-tier city for sustainability, and our ranking in the City Energy Efficiency Scorecard recognizes our achievements. Just recently, Atlanta became the first city in the Southeast to adopt a comprehensive energy policy that aims to significantly reduce citywide commercial energy use. Tailor-made for Atlanta, the ordinance is expected to spur the creation of more than 1,000 jobs a year in the first few years, as well as drive a 20% reduction in commercial energy consumption and reduce the city’s carbon emissions by 50% in 2030.”
In the five key areas covered by the report, the key findings are:
Government operations . Leaders in efficiency in local government operations are Denver, New York City, and Phoenix, all of which have set policies to increase efficiency in city government, procurement, and asset management.
Community initiatives . The top-scoring cities in community-wide initiatives are New York City and Boston. They both have systems to track progress toward efficiency-related goals for the whole community, and strategies to mitigate urban heat islands. They also have efficient distributed-energy systems, such as district energy and combined heat and power, and policies or programs to plan for future ones.
Buildings . Leading cities in buildings policies include Boston, New York City, and Washington. These cities have adopted or advocated for stringent building energy codes, devoted resources to building code compliance, established requirements and incentives for efficient buildings, and increased the availability of information on energy use in buildings through benchmarking and transparency policies. Residents and business owners can also access programs that take a systemic, building-wide approach to retrofits and upgrades.
Utilities . The leading cities in the energy utilities area are Boston, San Francisco, Portland, Minneapolis, and Chicago. Their energy efficiency programs offer high levels of savings. These cities also have productive relationships with their utilities in program implementation and access to energy data. Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, New York City, Los Angeles, Austin, Atlanta, Fort Worth, and El Paso are the leading cities in tackling efficiency in their water systems.
Transportation . Cities with the top transportation policy scores include Portland, Washington, Boston, and Seattle. Their initiatives include location-efficiency strategies, shifts to efficient modes of transportation, transit investments, efficient vehicles and vehicle infrastructure, and energy-efficient freight transport.
METHODOLOGY
ACEEE’s 2015 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard documents and compares actions cities can take to enable or improve energy efficiency. The report’s metrics are based on policy actions local governments can implement or influence and attempt to reflect the policy activity cities are taking. For the purposes of the Scorecard, ACEEE defines cities as the area within the political borders where a local government has direct policy authority. ACEEE included 51 cities in this edition of the Scorecard, up 17 from the 2013 edition of the report.
The report’s metrics measure policies and programs that achieve one or more of the following: directly reduce end-use energy consumption; accelerate the adoption of the most energy-efficient technologies; provide funding for energy efficiency programs; set long-term commitments to energy efficiency; establish or enforce building performance codes or standards; reduce market, regulatory, and information barriers to energy efficiency. All policy metrics analyzed are related to one of five policy areas identified above.

The City Energy Efficiency Scorecard is around the corner. How will your city rank?;"This is a busy time of year in competitive sports. Top teams in the NBA (including our hometown Wizards) and NHL are competing for the Larry O’Brien Trophy and Stanley Cup. American Pharaoh just won the Kentucky Derby last week, and Chelsea took the Premier League title. But don’t forget about another friendly competition—the one for most energy-efficient city in the 2015 City Energy Efficiency Scorecard! There are only five days to go until the results are released on Wednesday May 20.
This is the second biennial edition of the City Energy Efficiency Scorecard, which scores and ranks the country’s most populous cities on their energy efficiency policies and actions. The competition is even fiercer this time around with more cities vying to be the best. Thirty-four cities fought it out in 2013, but 51 are going at it this year. What does that mean for our returning veterans? Will Boston hold onto the Art Rosenfeld Cup? Will newcomers like Milwaukee and New Orleans change the face of the game?
Since this is the second edition of the City Scorecard, we are able to offer cities the title of “Most Improved” for the first time. We’ve seen mayors boast about new energy and climate policies such as climate action plans and benchmarking ordinances. And we’re seeing some utilities hitting the weight room on energy efficiency, beefing up their demand-side investment and savings. 
We’ve made a few adjustments to the rulebook. As in 2013, cities are competing in five policy areas: local government operations, community-wide initiatives, buildings, energy and water utilities, and transportation. While most of the metrics from the 2013 City Scorecard still stand, we’ve added a few new ones for this edition. The role of natural gas in the nation’s energy portfolio continues to expand, so this year we’re offering a point for documented savings of natural gas. Cities may also take a free throw to earn a bonus point by implementing voluntary benchmarking programs for buildings in the private sector.
Overall, cities earn points by submitting documentation of actions and performance that register on our energy efficiency metrics. We set up different tracks for cities served by municipal versus investor-owned utilities, and for cities who can set their own building codes as opposed to following state code. This ensures that no city has an unfair advantage.
All year long, fans can keep up to date on policies and programs in these Scorecard cities by visiting the ACEEE Local Policy Database. All the policy information we use to score the cities is housed here.
Your city isn’t in the Scorecard? That’s ok! By downloading and completing our Self-Scoring Tool then returning it to us, any local government can find out their score and learn what they can do to improve their community’s energy efficiency. We’ll be releasing an updated version of the tool based on the 2015 scoring methodology in the coming months.
Who will rise to the top, and who will need to go back to the drawing board?  Tune in on May 20th at noon to find out!

Work more, refuel less: efficiency opportunities for heavy-duty pickups and vans;"Heavy-duty pickups and vans have annual sales of more than 700,000 units and consume about 400,000 barrels of oil per day. The first US fuel efficiency and GHG emissions standards (Phase 1) for heavy-duty vehicles, adopted in 2011, will yield a 12% reduction in fuel consumption, on average, for heavy-duty pickups and vans by 2018. These vehicles are similar to their light-duty counterparts in design, technology, and work functions, but have higher payload capacity (gross vehicle weight rating above 8,500 lbs.) At present, the gap between fuel economy requirements for light-duty and heavy-duty pickups and vans is considerably higher than can be explained by differences in vehicle weight and payload. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation are now working on Phase 2 of the program, a major element of the president’s climate action plan. It offers an opportunity to narrow the efficiency gap between light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles and deliver major savings at the pump to buyers of heavy-duty pickups and vans. ACEEE’s new research report Fuel Efficiency and Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Heavy-Duty Pickups and Vans: Phase 2 assesses the technologies available to reduce fuel consumption in these vehicles.
Our assessment of technologies draws from the agencies’ analyses, a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report, and recent work from the Southwest Research Institute. The figure below summarizes the opportunities we found for fuel consumption reduction in gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles, relative to a typical 2010 vehicle.
Phase 1 and Phase 2 standards together could reduce the fuel consumption of gasoline pickups and vans by 31%, and of diesel pickups and vans by 28%, relative to 2010 levels. Given the agencies’ projections of savings from the first phase, this means that Phase 2 could reduce fuel consumption by 23% and 15% beyond Phase 1 levels in gasoline and diesel vehicles, respectively. Our calculations assume different penetration rates for individual technologies, depending on their applicability and market, and adjustments to reflect overlap in the technologies’ effectiveness.
Along with greater stringency, the Phase 2 rulemaking should make other improvements to the program. Vehicles’ fuel efficiency targets under the program vary with “work factor,” a parameter that reflects payload capacity, towing capacity, and four-wheel drive capability. Work factor should be defined based on a vehicle’s demonstrated capabilities and should adequately capture the relationship between the vehicle’s utility and its fuel consumption, both for gasoline and for diesel vehicles. New heavy-duty pickups and vans should display a fuel economy window sticker, similar to the one for light-duty vehicles, so that buyers can compare vehicles’ fuel efficiency, along with other performance features, both within and across classes.
The agencies’ proposal for the Phase 2 program is expected later this month or in June.

New Senate bills are good news for distributed generation and the smart grid;"A flurry of positive activity surrounding energy efficiency legislation took place on Capitol Hill last week, and progress continues this week with the introduction of two new energy efficiency-related bills with an emphasis on distributed generation (DG) and combined heat and power (CHP). Today, Senator Shaheen (D-NH) introduced the Clean Distributed Energy Grid Integration Act (S.1201) and the Heat Efficiency through Applied Technology (HEAT) Act (S.1202) for consideration before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
The first bill, which we refer to as the Grid Integration Act for short, directs the secretary of energy to develop an effort focused on advancing the integration of clean distributed energy into electric grids. The bill would support the advancement of several different distributed energy resources including CHP, renewables, energy storage, fuel cells, and waste heat to power (WHP). It calls for the convening of a stakeholder working group, the undertaking of research to address technical and regulatory barriers, and providing support for demonstrations of intelligent integration systems for distributed generation that are dynamic in response to changing grid conditions.
Provisions of the Grid Integration Act will support the deployment of new advances in intelligent sensing and control technologies, which benefit both the distributed system owner and the electric grid operator by facilitating more dynamic, adaptive, and anticipatory integration with the grid. Using advanced integration technologies will help bring clean energy solutions online, while optimizing the quality and reliability of a new, smarter electric grid.
The second bill, the HEAT Act, addresses three major regulatory barriers to encourage the deployment of CHP and WHP, both of which would strengthen local economies and support national energy goals. The HEAT Act provides assistance to states in considering the adoption of (1) updated interconnection procedures and tariff schedules; (2) model standards for supplemental, backup, and standby power fees for CHP and WHP systems; and (3) the most recent EPA guidance on output based emission standards.
A number of barriers impede the full capture of CHP potential, and provisions contained in the HEAT Act would help states overcome many of these barriers, cost-effectively and without mandates. Greater CHP deployment will result in a range of benefits, including lower energy bills for the system owner and societal benefits such as energy savings, reduced fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions when compared to conventional power plants. Further, by reducing the need for transmission and distribution, CHP can also benefit utilities by reducing grid congestion, deferring the need for infrastructure investments, and improving overall grid reliability.
We again commend Senator Shaheen and her colleagues for their continued leadership and recognition of the value of energy efficiency as both the Senate and House prepare comprehensive energy bills. We expect the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, under the leadership of Senators Murkowski (R-AK) and Cantwell (D-WA), to include one or both of these legislative proposals in its upcoming energy-related hearings this month. ACEEE testified at a hearing held last week, which was the first of four hearings on general energy titles—efficiency, infrastructure, supply, and accountability—that Chairman Murkowski has scheduled in May. A hearing on infrastructure is currently scheduled for May 14th, with a hearing on supply scheduled for May 19th.

On the road to bipartisan energy efficiency legislation;"Now that one energy efficiency bill is before the president, the real legislative work on energy efficiency begins. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 (S. 535) is three steps forward, a collection of three useful but relatively modest provisions on residential water heaters and commercial buildings. But there is a long way to go.
In a rare display of bipartisan and bicameral cooperation, both the House and Senate energy committees are working on broad energy bills. Both bills are expected to have multiple components designed to gain bipartisan support, including (in different combinations) energy efficiency, infrastructure, government accountability, workforce development, supply, and energy diplomacy. Some areas may be more bipartisan than others, and both houses are covering that territory first. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, surprisingly, started with a subcommittee hearing on job training legislation developed by ranking member Bobby Rush (D-IL). ACEEE had testified on the issue at an earlier hearing.
Now, showing remarkable coordination or convergence, both houses have scheduled hearings on energy efficiency at the same time next Thursday morning. The House has not yet released details on its hearing. The Senate Energy Committee hearing will cover 22 bills that have been introduced this year. ACEEE’s Steve Nadel has been invited to testify in the Senate hearing. Here are some of the highlights of those bills:
First is the latest version of what is now known as the Portman-Shaheen bill, the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2015 (S. 720). The bill is largely unchanged from last year, including a provision on building energy codes, the SAVE Act on energy efficiency in mortgages, and provisions on DOE’s industrial programs and on federal energy management, along with the three provisions in S. 535 that already were passed.
The hearing will cover a few new bills that ACEEE helped develop (others may be considered for an infrastructure title):
American Energy Efficiency Act (S. 1063 by Sen. Franken, D-MN). Establishes a federal energy efficiency resource standard that applies to all major electric and gas utilities. Programs are administered by states and build on existing state policies where they exist. Savings targets gradually ramp up, reaching 20% electric savings and 13% natural gas savings by 2030.
Smart Building Acceleration Act (S. 1046 by Sen. Cantwell, D-WA). Directs DOE to conduct smart building pilots with Departments of Energy, Defense, and Veterans’ Affairs, and the General Services Administration, and to incorporate smart buildings into existing programs such as the Better Buildings Challenge.
Commercial Building Benchmarking and Disclosure (S. 1052 by Sen. Franken). Builds on a provision in S. 535. Establishes two small grant programs, one to help utilities and their partners establish systems to provide whole-building benchmarking data to building owners, and another to assist local entities to consider benchmarking and disclosure policies.
ENERGY STAR Program Integrity Act (S. 1038 by Sen. Risch, R-ID). Protects the voluntary ENERGY STAR program by preventing class-action lawsuits over products delisted from the program if EPA has already required appropriate remedies.
In addition, the hearing will cover four bills on building retrofits, four bills on federal energy management, two bills on appliance efficiency standards, two bills on coordination between agencies and programs, and bills on access to information, state policies, regional coordination, water utility efficiency, and alternative fuel vehicles.
At first glance a few of the bills would appear not to further energy efficiency: in particular two of them—one on furnaces and another on ceiling fans—would hinder DOE appliance standards rulemaking and thus reduce savings.
This is just the beginning of a long haul. Consideration of the various components is expected to last into the summer. Final enactment will depend on whether Congress continues on this considered and bipartisan path or the bills become vehicles for partisan attacks and attempts to stymie President Obama’s actions.
We hope more energy efficiency will make it to the finish line to the benefit of the economy, taxpayers, consumers, and the environment.

New Senate bill spells progress for industrial energy efficiency;"This Congress has started out well for industrial energy efficiency. Today, Senator Shaheen (D-NH) introduced the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Act. This new bill joins the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2015 (S. 720), better known as the Portman-Shaheen bill, which was introduced earlier this year.
The Smart Manufacturing Leadership Act of 2015 will facilitate innovation, enhance energy savings, and improve the global competitiveness of American manufacturers through the use of smart manufacturing technologies and processes. It directs the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), in cooperation with other agencies, to develop a national smart manufacturing plan and to provide assistance to small- and medium-sized manufacturers in implementing smart manufacturing in their facilities.
Smart manufacturing is the use of information and communications technology to integrate all aspects of manufacturing, from the device level to the supply chain level, for the purpose of achieving superior control and productivity. Research by ACEEE and others has shown that smart manufacturing is demonstrating great promise for enhancing the efficiency of the existing manufacturing industry and dramatically reducing energy intensity, while making the firms more competitive.
A hallmark of the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Act is its focus on making the promise of smart manufacturing available to small- and medium-sized facilities that may not have the access to the same resources, such as high-performance computing capabilities, and expertise that larger firms can use to implement smart manufacturing solutions. DOE’s national labs are home to some of the fastest supercomputers in the world, and access to this infrastructure will allow small- and medium-sized manufacturers to develop realistic simulations and gain insight on product behavior, testing, and optimization of their processes and products.
In addition, the bill proposes that DOE use the existing Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs) to deliver some of the technical assistance that will help manufacturing facilities use energy more efficiently by applying intelligence. The IACs are celebrating their 40th anniversary this year. In recognition of the success of the program, the Portman-Shaheen bill reauthorizes a refreshed and enhanced program, making the IACs all the more important in assisting small- and medium-sized manufacturers with modernization through the use of technologies such as smart manufacturing.
We commend Senator Shaheen and her colleagues for providing the leadership to help make our manufacturing firms more energy efficient through smart manufacturing, and for remembering that firms of all sizes need access to 21st century technology.
While the introduction of legislation does not necessarily lead to passage (as we have seen over the past four years with the previous versions of Portman-Shaheen), these bills may have a better chance this Congress. We anticipate that the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, under the leadership of Senators Murkowski and Cantwell, will include this provision, along with some others from the Portman-Shaheen bill, in the Manufacturing subtitle of an omnibus energy bill. A similar effort to develop a comprehensive energy bill is underway by the House Energy and Commerce Committee under the leadership of Chairman Upton.

Celebrate Earth Day’s 45th anniversary by getting ready for an energy-efficient summer;"Earth Day turns 45 tomorrow, which means spring is in full swing and summer is just over the horizon. But you can stay calm, stay cool, and lower your carbon footprint, too, despite the approaching heat, by putting energy efficiency to work for you. Here is a sampling of tips gleaned from our recently launched smarterhouse.org, the evolution of ACEEE’s Consumer Guide to Home Energy Savings. Following these tips can save you money by cutting down on your utility bills, make your home more comfortable, as well as improve its performance, and cut your energy waste.
As you dream about warmer weather and summer activities, keep in mind that costs can creep up during the summer when you’re cooling your home. Cooling systems account for about 17% of energy use in the typical house. Here are our recommendations for keeping cool and saving energy:
Upgrade your cooling system. Thinking about improving your home cooling system before it gets really hot? If you are unsure, or your central air conditioning is 10-15 years old, you may want to consider calling in a qualified home performance contractor so you don’t end up selecting an inefficient model that will add to your expenses over the long term. Bear in mind that your decision should depend on your climate, and whether you are replacing an existing unit or installing an entirely new system.
Use your AC less and fans more. There are several measures you can take to ensure optimum performance of your AC. Start by keeping the air filters clean so they don’t impede air flow and damage the unit, conditioning only when ventilation is inadequate, and avoiding cooling unoccupied rooms. You can also use your AC in conjunction with ceiling or standing fans for more efficient cooling. Whenever you leave your home, adjust your thermostat to a warmer temperature to save energy. Or install a programmable thermostat, so you don’t need to remember to manually change the thermostat every day—you can save 3–5% on air conditioning costs for each degree that you raise the thermostat.
Drive green. Whether you are driving to the beach, the movies, or a mountaintop camping site, you can reduce your environmental impact not only by driving a more eco-friendly vehicle, but also by being more efficient about the way you maintain and drive your car. Little changes like keeping your tires properly inflated or carrying a lighter load when you travel can make a difference—Did you know that carrying around an extra 100 pounds reduces fuel economy by about 1%?
Change your lights. Replace traditional heat-generating incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescents (CFLs) or light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and think about installing light sensors and lamp timers to reinforce those energy savings. Lighting makes up about 5–10% of total energy use in the average American home, costing the typical household between $75 and $200 per year in electricity.
Keep your beer cold. The last thing you need is a non-functioning fridge in the middle of summer. Check the age and condition of your major appliances, especially the refrigerator. You may want to replace it with a more energy-efficient model before it dies. Note that it is generally much less expensive to buy and operate one big refrigerator rather than two small ones, so if you are thinking of buying a second one or keeping your old one for extra storage, you might want to reconsider. While you are at it, replace aging, inefficient appliances such as your dishwasher, oven, or dryer. Even if the appliance has a few useful years left, a top-efficiency model is generally a good investment. Make sure you know what to look for in order to select the most efficient model to save on energy and long-term costs.
Scrape, don’t rinse. Summer calls for a lot of hosting of family and friends. When you’re cleaning up after those parties, this will likely increase the number of dishwasher loads. A brand-new dishwasher isn’t the only way you can save and operate it efficiently. For example, instead of pre-rinsing all your dishes, before loading, simply scrape off any food and empty liquids to save time, water, and energy. If you find you must rinse dishes first, get in the habit of using cold water.
Find and seal air leaks. Did you know that air leakage accounts for almost 30% of heat lost from your house? Many of these holes in the building envelope are found in the attic, in places you might not think to look. Look into how to find and seal some of these leaks to make your house more comfortable before the hot summer weather begins.
Get an energy audit. Call in a home energy specialist (also known as house doctors, energy auditors, raters, or home performance contractors) before making major efficiency improvements to your house. They will figure out where and why energy is being wasted, and what you should do about it. Home energy specialists study the building as a system, and perform full checkups that are designed to address overall safety, comfort, energy efficiency, and indoor air quality.

Happy Earth Day, every day!

Congress just passed an energy efficiency bill;"Today, the House of Representatives passed S. 535, a modest energy efficiency bill sponsored by Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). This follows Senate passage a few weeks ago. The bill now heads to the president’s desk for his approval, which is highly likely.
The bill includes three provisions drawn from a larger efficiency bill sponsored by Portman and Shaheen. The bill has provisions that: (1) promote commercial building energy-use benchmarking and disclosure; (2) establish a voluntary “Tenant Star” program to promote energy efficiency in rental property; and (3) adjust efficiency standards for “grid-connected” water heaters so that water heaters needed for demand response and thermal storage programs can continue to be sold. ACEEE led work on the benchmarking and disclosure provision and played a substantial role in the other provisions, including presenting testimony on the water heater provision before a House committee earlier this month.
The bill will have modest impacts on energy consumption. What is probably most notable is that, in an environment where the political parties can agree on very little, energy efficiency is one of the few issues that generates enough bipartisan support to pass legislation. In fact, the bill passed both the House and Senate by overwhelming margins.
Hopefully this is a harbinger of future energy efficiency bills. For example, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing on April 30 on a broader array of energy efficiency bills, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to hold a similar hearing soon. We congratulate the House and the Senate for recognizing the value that energy efficiency brings to America’s homes and businesses, such as reduced energy bills and a better-functioning electric grid, and we look forward to working with both chambers to create a more energy-efficient nation.

A SUPR tool to map Clean Power Plan state compliance scenarios;"Later this summer, EPA will publish its final Clean Power Plan rule, regulating greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. Though the final rule has not yet been released, policymakers, state governments, utility operators, and other stakeholders are weighing their options to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) from the power sector in compliance with the rule. As states consider plans to submit to EPA, they will want to evaluate the costs of their compliance options, but comparing different strategies can be complex. To assist states in exploring the cost and pollution reduction potential of different options, ACEEE has created the State and Utility Pollution Reduction (SUPR) Calculator (Beta).
The proposed Clean Power Plan rule that came out last year allows states flexibility to pick from a host of pollution-reducing technologies and policies when designing their compliance plans. Energy efficiency is included in those options, along with renewable energy, nuclear power, natural gas generation, improvements to power plants, and many more.
The purpose of the SUPR calculator is to provide policymakers and stakeholders with a rough estimate of some of the costs and benefits of different policies and technologies that could help a state meet its air quality goals. Users can select from a list of 19 different policies and technologies, including energy efficiency policies, renewable energy options, nuclear power, emission control options, and natural gas, to build a compliance scenario in their state. SUPR shows users how much their scenario will cost and what they will get for that investment in just 4 easy steps:
For example, under the proposed rule, South Carolina is required to reduce its emission rate by 57%, to 772 pounds per megawatt-hour (MWh). In SUPR, you can pick from our options to see what you would need to do to comply with the rule. If you select an annual 1.5% energy savings target, building codes (high), combined heat and power (medium) twice, and ESCO programs, the results show that those policies together achieve 65% of the state’s compliance target, at a lower cost than many other compliance options. In addition, you can see in the figure—one of many in the calculator—how close the selected policies get the state to its goal.
SUPR calculator results for South Carolina
We will continue to refine the SUPR calculator to make it more useful. Please reach out to Sara Hayes (shayes@aceee.org) or Rachel Young (ryoung@aceee.org) with questions or suggestions.

No Building Left Behind: The Clean Power Plan and Multifamily Energy Efficiency;"This post was co-written by Todd Nedwick of the National Housing Trust
States will soon begin developing compliance plans to meet the greenhouse gas reduction targets required by EPA’s upcoming Clean Power Plan (CPP). As they contemplate different strategies, states should consider the important role that increasing the energy efficiency of multifamily buildings could play in cutting emissions and supporting local economies. Multifamily housing has been underserved by energy efficiency programs in most states, leaving great potential to reduce carbon emissions while also improving affordability of rental housing.
The CPP proposal calls on states to develop strategies for reducing greenhouse gases from existing power plants. The proposed plan grants states a great deal of flexibility in adopting strategies that best address the emissions of their individual energy portfolios. While states may draw from a variety of approaches, there’s increasing evidence that energy efficiency, as a pathway to compliance, might be the lowest-cost option for reducing carbon pollution. For many states, end-use energy efficiency is nothing new. In fact, many have shown much success in developing their energy efficiency resources, including statewide policy and utility-sponsored efficiency programs.
The CPP proposal gives states an incentive to ramp up energy efficiency, especially in underserved sectors. There remains significant untapped potential to cut emissions, save money, and boost local economies by reducing energy waste in affordable multifamily buildings. A forthcoming study by Efficiency for All will determine that a 26% reduction in electricity usage in affordable multifamily housing is cost-effectively achievable by 2034 in some states. The same study concluded that every dollar invested in multifamily energy efficiency returns more than $3 in benefits in reduced arrearages, customer calls, collection activities, and safety-related emergency calls. This is not to mention the higher comfort levels, increased housing property values, and health-related benefits that come with multifamily energy efficiency.
Equally important, because energy costs are often the highest operating expense in affordable multifamily housing, reduced energy costs help ensure the continued affordability of a much-needed housing stock—an issue facing many states and localities.
States should capitalize on recent developments in multifamily energy efficiency by including programs and policies that target the affordable multifamily housing sector in their compliance plans. In states with an energy savings target for utilities, or a similar commitment, utility-sponsored multifamily efficiency programs are a good starting point. Key elements of well-designed energy efficiency programs can be readily adopted to increase participation and savings in this sector. For example, utilities and governments can work together to provide a “one-stop shop” for building owners to access services and improved processes for building benchmarking. Moving forward, states can look to examples such as Massachusetts, Washington, and Minnesota, where energy savings achieved from multifamily, ratepayer-funded programs count towards state-set annual energy savings targets.
Beyond utility-sponsored efficiency programs, a handful of states support financing for multifamily energy efficiency through their state housing finance agency. Maryland’s Department of Housing and Community Development, for example, offers a multifamily loan program for energy efficiency investments that targets affordable rental properties. Similarly, the Pennsylvania State Housing Finance Agency recently provided financing for capital improvements that resulted in a reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of over 10,000 metric tons across 91 affordable multifamily properties. In their plans, states should consider claiming affordable housing energy programs like this as a means to compliance.
Many communities recognize the multiple benefits of healthier and more affordable housing for their residents. By including energy efficiency initiatives and programs targeted at affordable housing as part of state compliance plans, states can respond to these concerns while cutting emissions. States should seize the moment and collaborate with utilities, communities, and affordable housing stakeholders to ensure multifamily energy efficiency is a state priority.

Implementation of clean vehicle standards: How’s it going?;"  Standards cutting greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks and raising fuel economy are among the biggest environmental achievements of the Obama administration. The standards are projected to save consumers hundreds of billions of dollars in fuel expenditures over the next decade. In the process, they are helping to shape the US and global auto industries by establishing an expectation of continuing technological progress toward high efficiency, low-emitting vehicles.
A new report from the EPA presenting manufacturer performance data from the first two years of the greenhouse gas emissions standards shows how the program is shaping up. Manufacturers by and large met the standards in both 2012 and 2013, with room to spare. Average compliance values in 2013 were 12* grams per mile, or 4%, below (better than) what the program called for in 2013, and in fact a bit below the more stringent requirement for model year 2014.
The performance of a sampling of manufacturers (figure 1) helps to explain two important aspects of the program: how the size mix of vehicles sold affects the emissions requirements, and what the role of special credit provisions has been.
Figure 1: Performance of selected manufacturers, 2012 and 2013 
Data from EPA’s 2013 Manufacturer GHG Performance Report
Footprint Rules
The case of Ford underscores a key feature of the standards that press accounts often obscure: average fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions levels required under the standards for a given year depend on the size mix of vehicles sold that year. Average emissions of both Ford’s cars and its trucks declined from 2012 to 2013, yet their average emissions overall increased, due primarily to a whopping 11% shift from cars to trucks in Ford’s sales mix. This shift also meant that Ford’s average vehicle footprint (the area of pavement defined by the four wheels), and consequently its emissions standard, increased in 2013. Ford easily met its standard in both years.
This illustrates one reason that the “54.5 miles per gallon equivalent” commonly used to describe the requirement of the 2025 standards is not quite what it seems – the actual value required in 2025 will depend upon the mix of vehicles sold in that year. By the same token, how easy or difficult it is to achieve the standards in a future year is unrelated to what size vehicles consumers choose in that year.
Emissions also crept up for Toyota, even though average footprint went unchanged from 2012 to 2013. Toyota still met its standard handily, however, thanks in no small part to the Prius: we estimate that 58% of Toyota’s emissions margin can be traced to the high fuel economy of the iconic hybrid, though it accounted for only 11% of sales. Meanwhile, Nissan went from a 3 gram per mile deficit in 2012 to a 20 gram per mile surplus in 2013 and achieved the largest year-over-year reduction in emissions of the large manufacturers. The battery-electric LEAF, treated as a “zero emissions vehicle,” substantially helped Nissan’s performance (18% of compliance margin, at 2% of sales), but several other models also contributed to its 28-gram-per-mile average emissions improvement from 2012 to 2013.
Extra Credit
EPA’s report also lays out manufacturers’ use of credit provisions and other flexibility mechanisms of the program. Air conditioning (A/C) credits and flex-fuel vehicle (FFV) credits make up the vast majority of these special credits claimed in both 2012 and 2013. Manufacturers are acquiring A/C credits faster than the agencies expected by reducing the leakage of refrigerants and producing more efficient A/C systems, both of which yield real-world reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
By contrast, FFV credits, which are awarded for the sale of vehicles that can run on ethanol (E85), do not generally reflect any real emissions reductions, because FFVs in the United States run almost entirely on gasoline. Figure 2 shows how much credit manufacturers claimed under the program. (Manufacturers not shown claimed none.)
Figure 2: Flex-fuel vehicle credits by manufacturer, 2012 and 2013
Data from EPA’s 2013 Manufacturer GHG Performance Report
The Detroit manufacturers have taken far more advantage of the FFV credits than the industry has on the whole; they’ll need increasingly to do without as the credits are phased out in the coming years. As figure 1 shows, Chrysler came just shy of meeting its emission standard in both 2012 and 2013. The company has nonetheless stayed in compliance using other flexibilities of the program, including the purchase of a modest number of credits from other manufacturers in 2013. But without FFV credits, Chrysler’s emissions would have exceeded the standards by more than 20 grams per mile, or roughly two year’s worth of emissions reductions under the standard. Thus, continued reliance on FFV credits could leave the company behind in terms of real technological progress a few years hence.
As the fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards go under the microscope in an upcoming “midterm review” of the program, detailed accounts of progress such as the EPA report provides will be essential. The first two years of data indicate the program is on track and unfolding largely as planned.

Seizing a Critical Moment for Energy Efficiency Finance;"An unprecedented amount of capital is ready to be deployed into the market for energy efficiency investments. Deals are getting done, and pipelines are being filled for some. Momentum is growing, but we are still far shy of tapping this market’s $279 billion investment potential.
Simultaneously, the policy landscape is evolving in ways that may drive demand for projects in the near- and mid-term future. The Clean Power Plan, energy efficiency resource standards, and benchmarking and disclosure laws may generate project development. In addition, improved collection, dissemination, and analysis of building and financial performance may reduce the perceived risk around energy efficiency investments.
At the state level, many are thinking about new paths for deploying energy efficiency through resiliency investment, the transactive grid, and green banks to leverage private-sector dollars. Other factors that may bolster demand include intelligent efficiency, advances in net metering, and innovations in building and financial-performance data collection.
With all this exciting activity, it is clear to us that energy efficiency finance is facing a critical moment. The question is: Can we seize the moment and match capital with projects? As the clean energy landscape evolves, how do we ensure the greatest energy savings and financial returns from energy efficiency?
We are excited to explore these developments and questions at this year’s ACEEE Energy Efficiency Finance Forum. The forum, designed for investors, financiers, utilities, and policymakers, is scheduled for May 31–June 2 at the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco. Please visit our website for more information.

ACEEE Releases Tool for Including Building Codes in States’ Clean Power Plans;"Tool Will be First in a Series of Resources that Show States How to Take Credit for Emissions Reductions from Energy Efficiency
Washington, D.C. —Today the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released a step-by-step guide that helps states document and claim emissions reductions resulting from building energy codes as a means of complying with their obligations under the Clean Power Plan. The paper is the first in a series of guidance documents that demonstrate how a state can take advantage of energy efficiency in its compliance plan.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed Clean Power Plan establishes state-specific targets for carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. The proposed plan allows states to employ end-use energy efficiency to comply with the emissions targets, but provides little detail on how states would go about obtaining credit for these policies and programs.
By collecting 111(d) technical support documents, previous EPA guidance on crediting of air quality benefits from energy efficiency, and approved state implementation plans, ACEEE’s tool provides states with a step-by step and comprehensive approach to including building codes in their plans.
“Our tool turns the open-ended essay that states are currently facing into a more manageable “fill-in-the-blank” approach,” said ACEEE senior manager Sara Hayes.
“This tool offers interested states another cost-effective energy efficiency option to aid in complying with existing and pending EPA energy-related air regulations, while giving consumers and businesses more control over their energy bills,” said David Terry, executive director of NASEO.
Adoption of building energy codes could help states meet their compliance goals by leading to significant emissions reductions from the electric power sector. Buildings consume roughly 70% of our nation’s electricity. ACEEE has estimated that, taken together, increased code stringency and improved building code compliance could eliminate up to 169 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2030, which is comparable to taking over 35 million cars off the road.

New York’s REV: Will the state’s new energy plan spur savings or slow progress?;"At the end of February, the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) released its final decision in Phase One of its Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) docket. We applaud the commission’s efforts to address 21st-century energy service needs and the improvements in this decision compared to the initial straw proposal. However ACEEE is concerned that the energy efficiency efforts outlined in the plan may not match the PSC’s stated intent to “not only achiev[e] current energy reduction goals, but accomplish[] higher goals consistent with State energy policy, and potentially, federal carbon reduction rules.” The decision leaves many details still to be determined, and these details will very much affect whether the state energy efficiency policy goals can be met. We also have concerns about several of the details provided.
The REV Decision
According to PSC Chair Audrey Zibelman, REV is designed to “reorient the electric industry and the ratemaking process toward a consumer-centered approach that harnesses new technologies and markets.” The emphasis appears to be on distributed energy sources like solar, wind, and combined heat and power systems, and on shifting loads away from times of peak demand. At the same time, a section of the decision (pages 72-82) specifically addresses energy efficiency programs. Under the decision, the state’s distribution utilities will take the lead in offering such programs which will gradually transition from a focus on “resource acquisition” to a focus on long-term “market transformation” that “will drive more market-based approaches.”
The PSC decision initially requires utilities to file energy efficiency programs for 2016 by the end of this month, but later this year each utility will need to file a three-year plan covering 2016–2018. The PSC decision establishes minimum energy-saving goals each utility must achieve in 2016. All of the utility goals combined total about 0.37% of statewide electricity sales. As discussed below, this is an extremely modest initial goal, and therefore we hope that the utility proposals will significantly exceed their minimum.
For 2017 and beyond, the utilities are told to propose metrics, both with the expectation that “longer-term goals should exceed existing targets,” and should include market progress metrics that go beyond kWh savings. Under REV, current statewide resource acquisition programs now operated by NYSERDA will largely end, the major exception being programs for low-income consumers that NYSERDA will continue to operate. NYSERDA will operate a set of market-transformation-focused programs in 2016 that will be finalized in a separate PSC docket.
The final decision is a significant improvement relative to a staff straw proposal issued in August 2014 that said energy efficiency budgets and targets would exist only for a transition period until “markets develop” and “utility performance measures…drive efficiency to become more integrated into utility operations.” In the final decision, programs continue “at least during the transition to REV markets,” and in various places the decision seems to support longer-term energy efficiency programs and goals that extend beyond a short transition period. In addition, the decision focuses much more on the market transformation approach to program design, an approach that ACEEE has long espoused.
However, even with these changes, we have concerns in three areas: energy-saving goals, how best to transform markets, and the transition from the present programs to the new construct.
Energy-Saving Goals
The energy-saving goals established by the PSC for 2016 are modest. While the PSC notes that it expects higher savings goals in the future, it offers no specifics. Developing these specifics will be critical. In 2007 New York set the goal of using energy efficiency to reduce electricity consumption by 15% below projected levels by 2015, an average of 1.9% savings per year. While building codes and equipment efficiency standards accounted for part of this goal, a substantial majority of the savings were to come from utility and NYSERDA programs.
In contrast, the 2016 minimum savings targets in the decision are only about 20% of this overall prior goal. Some of New York’s neighbors such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont have exceeded 2% annual savings (see p. 33 of our State Scorecard), showing that much higher savings are possible. The PSC should strive to meet these same goals and work with utilities to steadily ramp up savings to at least the prior goal of 1.9% per year if not higher.
As the PSC notes and ACEEE has found, the market transformation approach can increase energy savings in the medium and long terms. Energy saving goals should reflect this, complemented by goals for other key market transformation metrics. Our research indicates that states with binding energy savings targets save much more energy and money than states that leave energy efficiency decisions to utility planning processes.
Transforming Markets
As I wrote recently in a series of posts on the role of energy efficiency markets and programs, the most successful efforts meld the two. In particular, some market segments are riper for market-focused approaches than others. For example, private energy service companies have done well with large institutional customers. However other market segments such as small businesses and many residential customer segments have yet to see significant success. We should experiment with new market-based approaches for these unproven market segments, but we should also continue to use proven program approaches until alternatives prove their efficacy. The details of REV’s experimentation are critical and will be determined later this year in utility filings and an open docket on NYSERDA’s clean energy programs.
The market transformation approach to program design can help address the gap between current programs and an increasing reliance on markets. Market transformation programs work to overcome market barriers in specific market segments and also help with the development of promising technologies and services. Unfortunately, the REV decision seems to take a simplistic view of market transformation. For example, while we agree with the PSC that rebates are only one tool in the market transformation kit bag, they can be an important one, and the PSC is making a mistake by claiming that the place for a rebate program within a market transformation curve is “limited.” (We discuss the full kit bag including the role of rebates in Appendix B of an earlier ACEEE paper.)
Likewise, the PSC is too limited when it says “the end goal of a market transformation program for any particular measure is to eliminate further need for customer-funded subsidies of that measure.” Incentives can sometimes be ended once a market transformation initiative is successful, but sometimes it makes sense to continue a program and raise the eligibility level. For example, if efforts to promote air conditioners with a SEER (seasonal energy efficiency ratio) of 16 are successful, rather than end the air conditioner program, perhaps the target should be increased to SEER 18 or 20. At the same time the program might focus more on quality installation and maintenance to achieve additional energy and peak-demand savings.
Transitioning from the Present to the Future
It will take time until new market transformation initiatives have an impact, and time to experiment with other market-focused approaches. For example, a 2003 ACEEE study that examined 28 market transformation initiatives illustrates that it generally takes at least five years before a market transformation initiative has a significant impact, and often substantially longer. In the meantime, the recent REV decision leaves the fate of many successful programs in limbo. NYSERDA has had some very successful programs that ACEEE has recognized in the past such as its Multifamily Performance,Commercial and Industrial Existing Facilities, Commercial New Construction, Flexible Technical Assistance, Home Performance with Energy Star, and low-income programs. As part of REV, NYSERDA will retain the lead for low-income and many market transformation programs, but the others will end unless the utilities pick them up. We had hoped that the REV decision would direct the utilities and NYSERDA to carefully consider these proven programs and to develop transition plans for many of them. Instead the decision provides no direction on this issue and leaves decisions on these programs up to the individual utilities.
The Path Forward
New York fell four places (from 3rd to 7th) in ACEEE’s 2014 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, due in part to REV transition issues. Without robust and ongoing support for energy efficiency from the PSC, the state could drop further. For example, if New York had achieved only 0.37% electricity savings in 2013 and higher goals had not been established, it would have placed even lower in the 2014 Scorecard.
There is much the PSC can and should do to build on the energy efficiency intentions stated in its REV decision. First, it should encourage utilities to include robust energy efficiency programs and goals in their plans, and it should make these goals an important consideration for plan approval. As part of this effort, the PSC should encourage the utilities to work with NYSERDA and develop transition strategies for current programs. Second, with the completion of Phase One, REV now moves into a second phase which will focus on rates and rate making, including performance-based regulation under which performance metrics are set and utilities are rewarded for good performance on them. Energy efficiency performance should be one of the key metrics used to evaluate utility performance.
New York has been an energy efficiency leader for many years. It can build on this leadership if REV is implemented with strong energy savings and other market transformation goals while gradually transitioning from past programs to the future.

Challenges and Opportunities in the Land of Lincoln;"Illinois—the land of Lincoln according to its license plate—has made great strides in energy efficiency in recent years. In 2014 it ranked 11th overall in ACEEE’s annual State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, up 15 slots from its score 5 years earlier. The main reason for its rise in rank was the state’s performance on utility-sector energy efficiency programs and policies. Energy efficiency measures installed under utility-sector programs reduced statewide electricity use by about 1% of the state’s total electricity consumption in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available. This placed Illinois 13th among US states in electricity savings, up from a tie for dead last in the 2009 Scorecard.
Under Illinois law, utilities collect the money for efficiency programs through rates, keeping 75% of the funds to operate their energy efficiency programs. They remit the remaining 25% to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO), which uses these funds to operate energy efficiency programs for low-income households and for state and local government facilities. Both the utilities and DCEO have done well. A 2014 ACEEE analysis found that Illinois electric utilities have exceeded their energy saving goals every year, while the gas utilities have just about met theirs. A 2014 independent evaluation of DCEO’s programs estimated that they have an overall benefit-cost ratio of 2.26.
Unfortunately, in late February, Illinois’ new governor, Bruce Rauner, proposed a budget that would divert $265 million of ratepayer funds intended to be used for energy efficiency and low-income energy assistance to the state general fund, to apply to a state budget shortfall (further information here). This includes DCEO’s energy efficiency programs that are discussed above as well as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps pay the energy bills of low-income families. Even though the proposed budget isn’t effective yet, it’s reported that senior staff at DCEO’s energy efficiency programs have already been laid off, and remaining staff told not to sign any new contracts or to approve any new rebate applications. Most legal observers believe the legislature must approve the diversion—its approval is far from certain—but the governor appears not to be waiting.
In addition to considering budget issues, the legislature will also be debating energy legislation this year that could increase energy efficiency activity in the state. Current Illinois law calls for savings that are double what the utilities are currently achieving. The savings are lower than the law requires since the law also includes cost caps that limit the amount of money the utilities can spend. This keeps them from reaching their full savings goals even if the additional spending is cost effective to ratepayers. As part of the forthcoming energy bill, a coalition of business, environmental and labor leaders is proposing to raise the cost caps while still requiring programs to meet cost-effectiveness tests.
If the governor doesn’t want DCEO to operate energy efficiency programs any more, it might also make sense to use this legislation to let utilities keep all the energy efficiency funds they raise instead of diverting a quarter of the money to the state. If such a change is made, the utilities should be directed to provide energy efficiency services to the customers DCEO used to serve.
While Illinois does have budget problems, the solution shouldn’t divert utility ratepayer funds that are intended by statute to achieve cost-effective energy savings and reduce energy bills for public facilities and low-income customers. This diversion is penny wise and pound foolish. These funds not only save energy, they reduce costs for all taxpayers and ratepayers in Illinois.

Water heaters get an efficiency makeover courtesy of the Department of Energy;"From the rustic 1850s pump shower to the 1920s Humphrey automatic to today’s modern units, water heaters have made great strides in performance and efficiency. On April 16, 2015, water heaters will take the next great stride when manufacturers must comply with new Department of Energy (DOE) efficiency standards. The most common water heaters manufactured on and after this date will get a modest boost in efficiency, while units over 55 gallons will shift to next-generation technology, cutting utility bills by one-fourth to one-half depending on the technology.
What is covered?
Completed by DOE in 2010, the standards cover gas, oil and electric residential tank water heaters, usually between 20 and 80 gallons. (DOE also upped the efficiency levels for instantaneous—tankless—gas water heaters, but most models already meet the new efficiency levels.) Water heating is on average the second largest household energy expense behind space heating, representing about 18% of total household energy consumption in the US. Consumers annually pay an average of about $170 (gas) and $300 (electric) to operate a water heater just meeting current efficiency standards. About 50% of US households use natural gas water heaters, 41% electric, and the remainder propane or oil.
New standards will save money for consumers, save energy, and reduce emissions
DOE estimates that the new efficiency measures will save 2.6 quadrillion Btus (quads) of energy over 30 years and net consumers up to $8.7 billion in savings. Over the same period, the standards will reduce CO2 emissions by 154 million metric tons. To put these long-term savings in perspective, the savings are enough to meet the total energy needs of 13 million typical US homes for a year, and the CO2 savings are equivalent to taking 32 million passenger cars off the road for a year.
Most storage water heaters to get a modest boost in efficiency
For storage water heaters with volumes of 55 gallons and below (representing the vast majority of sales), the new standards will increase the efficiency of typical-sized units by 4% on average. Manufacturers plan to meet the efficiency levels with incremental improvements such as improved heat exchangers (gas) and more insulation. Water heaters that comply with the new standards are already on the market, including models from the three large domestic manufacturers (A.O. Smith, Bradford White, and Rheem) that make most water heaters sold in the United States.
Big jump in efficiency for storage water heaters over 55 gallons
Water heaters larger than 55 gallons will see a much bigger jump in efficiency. The new standards for these larger water heaters can be met using electric heat pump and gas condensing technology. Heat pump water heaters save at least 50% and condensing gas units about 25% compared to today’s conventional water heaters.
Heat pump water heaters (also known as hybrid water heaters) transfer heat from the surrounding air to the water. When hot water demand is very high or the ambient air temperature drops below a threshold level, the hybrids switch from heat pump mode to electric resistance mode. According to DOE’s analysis, a consumer purchasing these highly efficient units will save more than $600 over the life of the product compared to a water heater just meeting the current efficiency standards. While the upfront cost to purchase and install these products is higher, consumers will recoup the added cost in about six years on average through lower electricity bills. Consumer Reports tested heat pump water heaters and found that “Those we tested provided annual savings of about 60% over electric-only models.”
One key concern about heat pump water heaters is low temperature operation. When the heat pump water heater operates in electric resistance mode, it doesn’t save energy or money compared to a conventional unit. Research by the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance showed that some early heat pump water heater models were cutting over to electric resistance mode at relatively high ambient temperatures. Manufacturers have been working to lower the minimum temperature at which water heaters operate in heat pump mode. Recent models have made significant progress, ensuring heat pump operation down to ambient temperatures as low as 35 degrees. The vast majority of utility programs in the Northwest point to the Northern Climate Specification Qualified Products List to determine whether a heat pump water heater qualifies for utility incentives
Condensing gas water heaters are not as prevalent as heat pump water heaters, but consumers have more choices today than they did just a few years ago. Conventional gas water heaters lose much of the energy burned up the flue. Condensing water heaters are designed to reclaim much of this escaping heat by cooling exhaust gases well below 140 degrees F, where water vapor in the exhaust condenses into water.
Details on the new standard levels
The table below shows the current and new standards for typical-sized storage units. The water heater standards vary as a function of tank size. The energy factor (EF) is the ratio of useful energy output from the water heater to the total amount of energy delivered to it.
Size change: a bit bigger, but there are options
A review of manufacturer websites shows that the height and/or diameter of some conventional products will increase 1 to 2 inches due to added insulation (some less than an inch). For many homes, particularly those with basement installations, the small increase in size will have little impact. Consumers with space constraints (e.g., water heaters in closets or crawl spaces) should consult manufacturer websites or local installers for options. Consumers may find that a product from one manufacturer fits better in their tight space than a similar product from a different manufacturer.
Manufacturers prepared for changes
Manufacturers are offering webinars, online videos, and educational materials to guide consumers, contractors, and installers through the changes. Several website include cross-reference guides to help consumers compare current models to models meeting the new standards. You will find most of the educational materials on manufacturer websites under NAECA (National Appliance Energy Conservation Act), the legislation that authorized appliance efficiency standards.
What about grid-enabled water heaters?
Utilities represented by the National Rural Electric Cooperative (NRECA) and the American Public Power Association, along with PJM Interconnection (regional grid operator) raised concerns that demand-response programs for water heaters over 55 gallons would suffer if they were required to switch to heat pump water heaters. In these programs, utilities control the use of grid-enabled (connected) water heaters to manage energy use at peak times, resulting in large savings. Though some stakeholders claim that heat pump water heaters can provide the services that NRECA and others desire, not all stakeholders are convinced that they will work as well. A legislative fix to establish a class of water heaters for demand-response programs is pending in Congress. In addition, some manufacturers have petitioned for waivers for this application.

California building codes: to analyze the forest you need to understand the trees;"ACEEE is a strong supporter of analyzing energy efficiency programs in order to see what they have accomplished and to learn lessons so we can do even better. It was thus with interest that we reviewed “How Much Energy Do Building Energy Codes Really Save? Evidence from California” by Arik Levinson. In this paper Levinson conducts several analyses and concludes that “there is no evidence that homes constructed since California instituted its building energy codes use less electricity today than homes built before the codes came into effect.” On the surface his conclusions about the efficacy of building codes are very different from other recent analyses such as papers by Aroonruengsawat et al., Deason and Hobbs, and Jacobsen and Kotchen, so we took a deeper look.
Building energy codes in the United Sates primarily address energy used for space heating and air conditioning, with some impact on water heating energy use. In addition, commercial building codes also address lighting in a substantial way. Therefore any analysis of the effect of codes needs to look at energy consumption for these end uses. Levinson is examining California, so we should start by looking at how California heats and cools its buildings and water. The California Energy Commission had a consultant prepare a report looking at residential appliance saturations in 2009. They found that 93% of California homes are heated with gas and only 5% are heated with electricity. Likewise they found that 87% of homes have gas water heating and only 7% use electricity for water heating. Central air conditioners are used in 49% of homes, with an additional 15% using room air conditioners. California added a limited lighting provision to its 2008 residential code, but the savings are too recent and too small to show up in a long-term analysis.
Based on this information, an analysis of California residential building codes should concentrate on natural gas use and only secondarily on electricity. Unfortunately, this is the opposite of what Levinson does. Most of his analysis is on electricity use, and he generally excludes homes with electric space or water heat. He does so because the saturation of electric space heat has been changing over time, and according to Levinson, therefore doesn’t fit well into his time series analysis. Thus his analysis looks for the effect of building codes on air conditioning energy use.
The fact is, though, that California has a mild climate, and, according to a recent analysis by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), only 4% of California home energy use is for air conditioning. Using EIA figures we can go on to calculate that air conditioning represents about 10% of home electricity use. If we make a ballpark estimate that codes reduce air conditioning electricity use by 30%, Levinson is looking for 3% savings in the data.
Furthermore, a majority of the savings in air conditioning energy use is probably due to air conditioner efficiency standards that also apply to replacement equipment in existing homes. Since Levinson is comparing new and existing homes, of the 3% savings mentioned above, perhaps 2% are also being achieved in his comparison group of existing homes. Thus he’s looking for a 1% savings effect in new homes. It’s very difficult to find such a small effect in a statistical analysis; with an effect that small, it would be more surprising to see such savings show up in a statistical analysis than if the savings did not show up. In addition, it should be noted that the rising saturation of electronic gadgets in US homes may be affecting new home energy use, a factor Levinson does not examine but that perhaps explains some of the increasing energy use he found in new homes.
A good analysis of the impact of California’s building codes should focus on natural gas use. Levinson does do one analysis of natural gas use, finding that homes built since California’s building energy code began use less natural gas than earlier homes. However he then dismisses this finding since the trend started before the building codes took effect. He presents no evidence that prior trends would have continued, and therefore his claim that building codes had no effect is speculation.
Finally, if the objective is to examine all building codes and not just some codes, then it’s also important to look at commercial buildings. According to an analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, nationwide about 69% of building code savings in 2012 were in the commercial sector and only 31% in the residential sector. More than 80% of the commercial savings were in electricity.
Bottom line: Levinson is on the wrong path if he’s trying to see the impacts of building codes. If he wants to see the forest—the impacts of codes or their absence—he needs to understand the trees. He needs to look where the impacts are supposed to be, and in California this means residential natural gas and commercial building electricity use.

Looking to the future of energy efficiency markets and programs;"Part Three in a series where ACEEE examines the most effective roles for energy efficiency programs and market-driven solutions in scaling deployment of energy efficiency. To read Part One click here. For Part Two, click here.
My first blog post addressed the false dichotomy of choosing between energy efficiency programs and market-driven solutions, pointing out the successes and limitations of market-based solutions and the need for markets and programs to work together in order to maximize societal benefits. My second post reviewed the history of efforts to increase reliance on market-driven solutions, finding success in a few market segments, difficulties in some other market segments, and a tendency to focus on “low-hanging fruit.” However, the clean energy landscape is changing, and new approaches can and are being tried that may potentially have better outcomes in the future. In this final blog post in the series, we’ll explore recent developments and potential opportunities ahead, including both market-driven opportunities and opportunities for market-driven solutions and energy efficiency programs to work together.
Much has changed in energy efficiency and related markets in recent years, and further major changes are likely. New technologies and services continue to be developed, and new players enter the market every year. Recent developments include many new intelligent efficiency opportunities and the growing saturation of smart meters that make a wealth of new information available to customers and those who serve them. New firms are offering behavior-based services and nurturing interest in new financial products, such as those from green banks and from private firms. The utility industry is also going through profound changes, which could affect how energy efficiency services are offered. And proposed new regulations to reduce carbon pollution from existing power plants will likely increase the need to capture as much energy efficiency savings as possible.
In this environment, it is useful to divide energy efficiency opportunities into three segments: (1) those in which markets are largely functioning well, and in which only limited energy efficiency programs are needed; (2) those in which market barriers are particularly large, and in which programmatic support is likely to be needed for the foreseeable future; and (3) a large in-between category, in which it is appropriate to experiment with new approaches in the hope that many will work, but with the expectation that some will not.
Where market-driven approaches are largely functioning well
There are some market segments where market-driven approaches are doing well. Energy service companies (ESCOs) have refined their service offerings for the so-called “MUSH” market (municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals) and now are doing nearly $6 billion a year in business, primarily in energy-saving performance contracts  (ESPCs) that guarantee a level of savings, often for ten years or more. Energy-efficiency programs can sweeten ESCO offerings by encouraging ESCOs to go broader and deeper with their energy efficiency retrofits and to reach some customers they might not reach on their own, particularly customers somewhat smaller than those they normally serve. A 2014 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study found that 36% of ESCO projects involve energy efficiency program incentives.
ENERGY STAR® now certifies more than 70 different energy-consuming products, identifying roughly the top 25% to receive the ENERGY STAR label. More than 85% of consumers recognize the label. Market penetration ranges from about 1% (for electric water heaters) to nearly 100% (for some categories of televisions) with the average roughly 50%. Most of these products receive promotional assistance from energy efficiency programs but not direct incentives. However, a companion program, ENERGY STAR Most Efficient, recognizes the very best products on the market and needs help from energy efficiency programs, both promotion and incentives, to encourage both sales and increased product offerings.
Very large industrial customers often have in-house energy managers who are able to effectively manage a firm’s energy use and identify promising projects. Allocation of capital to fund energy efficiency programs remains the primary barrier to greater implementation of these projects. Energy efficiency program incentives, either in the form of cash or in-kind services can be a major inducement to move these projects up the list for project funding. For these large customers with well-established internal programs, self-direct programs have proven effective in providing incentives to customers for their internal energy management efforts.
Areas for experimentation
A number of additional market segments and services could potentially be attractive for market-focused strategies, although for many of them there are also significant roles for energy efficiency programs. Examples include:
ESPCs in Large Commercial Facilities and New Takes on the ESCO Model. ESCOs see substantial opportunity to serve the large commercial market, applying lessons they have learned in the MUSH market. The development of insurance products to manage risk around these types of projects could provide comfort to more building owners and ESCOs around deeper retrofits. The Vermont Energy Investment Corporation (VEIC) has also established a low-profit limited liability company (L3C), Commons Energy has developed a Public Purpose ESCO that hopes to address underserved markets including small- to mid-size multifamily affordable housing.
Smart Buildings and Smart Manufacturing. Sensors, controls, software, and data analysis are being used to optimize buildings and manufacturing. For example, new smart building services can help optimize building operations, saving 10% or more in some applications. There are similar opportunities in manufacturing. Payback periods are commonly only a few years, and can be expected to decline with time. Energy efficiency programs can help to encourage initial installations and document benefits, but over time, vendors may be able to sell these services without incentives, particularly in large facilities. Likewise, new smart thermostat products can optimize heating and cooling based on current weather and a household’s patterns. Heating and cooling energy savings of 10% or more have been documented in a few studies, although more data are needed. Sales are growing, but due to the high purchase cost, marketing has so far targeted upscale consumers. Upscale markets could flourish, although energy efficiency programs are likely to be needed if more downscale consumers are to enjoy the benefits as well. Integration of these thermostats with other sensors and controls could enable truly smart homes and businesses.
New Financing Strategies. There is a lot of creative activity happening to develop new financing strategies that hopefully will have much broader appeal than past programs. For example, on-bill finance and PACE finance have received a lot of buzz in the last few years for their ability to attract secondary markets, and for their potential to serve traditionally harder-to-reach markets. In a few cases thus far, PACE in particular has achieved significant market penetration. For example, Renovate America’s HERO Program has used PACE in California to finance approximately 25,000 home upgrades and has completed two rounds of securitization. It is important to note, though, that many entities realizing success with financing are also leveraging ratepayer incentives. In addition, there are new private sector start-ups that are closing deals, including Noesis, Kilowatt Financial, Joule Assets, and SparkFund. And, multiple states have started green banks to explore new models for delivering energy efficiency across multiple market sectors.
Home and Building Rating and Disclosure. Developing standardized energy efficiency ratings for homes and buildings, and disclosing this information to potential purchasers and tenants, can make it much easier for shoppers to consider energy efficiency as they make purchase and lease decisions, creating an incentive for home and building owners to improve efficiency before they sell or lease. Quite a few cities have established commercial building disclosure programs. Residential programs are also offered, but thus far are more limited.
Energy Use Feedback and Data. Providing consumers with information on their energy use and how it compares to peers has been shown to reduce energy use about 2% for monthly mailed reports, and by roughly 4% when feedback is in real time. Such approaches have also been used to reduce demand during peak times by an average of 3% without incentives. So far these efforts have been primarily offered under contract with utilities, but private firms could potentially offer these services if either they receive performance incentives from utilities, or if energy pricing is structured in ways to reward consumers who purchase these services. More broadly, with much more data now available from smart meters, and increased attention on ways to glean insights from “big data,” there should be many opportunities for both utilities and contractors working with customers to extract targeted information on specific opportunities for saving energy, and for targeted marketing of these opportunities.
Jointly Marketing Efficiency and Solar. Quite a few firms are aggressively marketing photovoltaic systems. A few of these, such as Solar City, are also marketing energy efficiency services, both as a way to increase bill savings and as a way to reduce system costs, since when loads are smaller, systems can be smaller. We see this trend growing.
Electric and gas vehicles. Electric vehicles generally use less energy per mile traveled than gasoline and diesel vehicles, even when considering the full fuel cycle, including energy losses at the power plant. As a result, while purchase costs are high, operating costs are generally lower, even after allowing for the fact that electricity is generally more expensive per Btu of energy than gasoline. Likewise, natural gas vehicles also generally have lower operating costs, due to the lower costs of their fuel, although their efficiency is similar to gasoline vehicles. We see growing efforts to promote these technologies, including by vehicle manufacturers, other private service providers, governments, and utilities. For example, the California Public Utility Commission originally asked utilities to not build charging stations in order to leave this field to private vendors, but recently reversed course, concluding that utilities have an important role to play in the development of this market.
These are just a sampling of potential areas where it is worth experimenting with market-oriented approaches but also where energy efficiency programs can perhaps partner with service providers in order to achieve savings while also providing valuable services to customers. If I were to revisit this topic in a few years, I am sure there would be additional examples to add, as the market for efficiency services is currently very dynamic.
Where market barriers are large and energy efficiency programs are clearly needed
Other market segments are likely to continue to be reliant on energy efficiency programs for at least quite a few years, although market-driven strategies can also play a role. At the top of this list are programs for low-income households, where, without significant incentives, energy efficiency actions are likely to be limited. The barriers to energy efficiency in low-income households include limited income to pay upfront costs and poor credit histories, making loan approval difficult.
Other challenging market segments include rental housing and small businesses. Rental units face the split incentive problem, where landlords have little incentive to invest if tenants pay the energy bills, and tenants have little incentive to use energy smartly if the landlord pays the bills. If buildings are rated on energy efficiency, and this becomes a factor in leasing decisions, then landlords will have some incentive to improve their units, although outside of high-rent buildings, there will likely be a long-term need for best-practice energy efficiency programs.
Likewise, small businesses can be hard to reach as owners and other decision makers generally have little time or expertise to consider energy efficiency opportunities; plus, marketing costs are high per unit of energy saved. So far, the most effective approach for this segment has been ""direct installation” energy efficiency programs (see section starting on p. 186), where specific services are offered, and all the owner has to do is say “yes.” Noesis has done some small-commercial projects, working through contractors and providing financing, but thus far many of these projects are lighting only, and their large commercial projects significantly outnumber their small commercial projects.
Markets and energy efficiency programs working together
In most market segments there is a role for both market strategies and energy efficiency programs, with the relative mix of each varying by market segment. Of the areas discussed above, markets are ultimately likely to dominate in the large MUSH market, but help from programs will likely continue to be needed for smaller facilities. After the market develops further and benefits are clearly demonstrated, smart-building and smart-manufacturing systems may do well without incentives, particularly for large facilities, and as prices come down, medium-sized facilities may also benefit. For smart thermostats, markets may dominate for upscale homeowners, but programs are likely to be needed to promote their use for households where the high upfront cost is an issue.
For energy-efficient equipment, ENERGY STAR can generally promote equipment of above-average efficiency, but for the very best equipment, more active promotion from energy efficiency programs will be needed, helping to grow availability and market share until those levels can become the ENERGY STAR standard, and ultimately, levels mandated by minimum efficiency standards. A similar situation exists for new construction, where modest efficiency improvements can be encouraged by ENERGY STAR homes and LEED certification, but more extensive improvements, such as net zero energy homes and buildings, will need more active assistance from energy efficiency programs, such as providing technical assistance to architects, engineers, and developers on state-of-the-art design practices.
For existing single-family homes and small/medium-sized businesses, both markets and energy efficiency programs have important roles to play. Contractors often sell efficiency services to these markets and have achieved some success, but energy efficiency programs can substantially increase the number of customers who purchase these services and can also increase the depth of savings. For these market segments, neither the market nor efficiency programs can do it all, and new creative approaches are needed. To note just one potential approach, Nate Adams, founder of Energy Smart Home Performance, has proposed that programs just pay per unit of energy saved and leave all other details to the market.
Experimenting, but not gambling, with energy efficiency savings
Much of this blog post talks about new market-based approaches that show some potential for achieving energy savings and other benefits. I strongly encourage experimenting with these approaches, but we should be careful not to phase out proven, more traditional approaches until new approaches are proven to achieve similar participation rates and savings. If we phase out programs prematurely or rely on approaches that are less effective than current programs, the result will be less energy efficiency savings and more need to rely on new energy supplies. As discussed in the first blog post in this series, energy efficiency is generally the lowest cost resource. It helps keep energy bills down, and helps meet environmental objectives, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We do not want to sacrifice these important objectives. Therefore the measuring stick for both programs and markets is to maximize the amount of energy savings that can be achieved at a cost below that of new power plants and other energy resources.
Conclusion
Clearly, markets are a major component of the success of today’s energy efficiency efforts, and can probably play an even larger role going forward. This post points out some potential market opportunities over the next five years or so; in the longer-term even more may be possible, although it is hard to predict where. The fundamental question in this debate, though, is not which policy works best, markets or energy efficiency programs, but how to build a mutually cooperative strategy, taking the best from markets and energy efficiency programs.
In addressing this question, two overriding issues apply, regardless of the market segment or service in question. The first is: Which approach is most cost-effective for a given market? Our research shows that right now, most traditional energy efficiency programs are hard to beat. The second is a question of reach: Which approach is more likely to scale to meet the breadth of the potential efficiency market, and which approach can reach the depth of consumers in any given segment? So far, the answer seems to be mixed. Finance and other market-based approaches can leverage resources to reach a scale that traditional programs may have trouble achieving, while those same market approaches may be fundamentally incapable of reaching the full spectrum of energy consumers—a critical consideration, particularly where ratepayer funds are being deployed. At the end of the day, the winning strategy will be the one that takes the best from markets and energy efficiency programs in order to maximize benefits to all ratepayers and to society as a whole.

A look at the history of efforts to increase reliance on market forces to drive energy efficiency;"Part Two in a series where ACEEE examines the most effective roles for energy efficiency programs and market-driven solutions in scaling deployment of energy efficiency. Click here to read Part One.
Last week, I wrote about the false dichotomy between energy efficiency programs and market-driven solutions, pointing out the successes and limitations of market-based solutions. We should encourage the private market where it works well, experiment with new market-based approaches in other promising market segments, but also continue to use other proven approaches, such as utility and state energy-efficiency programs, particularly for market segments where the success of market-focused approaches has yet to be proven. In this post I summarize research on the role of market-focused programs over the past few decades. In the final installment next week I will look at recent developments and potential opportunities ahead.
As philosopher and essayist George Santayana wrote in The Life of Reason (1905), “[t]hose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Things can and do change, so the past is far from an absolute guide to the future, but understanding the past is useful so we can better plan paths forward.
The recent history of market-based energy efficiency
There was a major push toward market-based approaches to delivering energy efficiency in the 1990s. ACEEE reviewed the success of these efforts in a 2001 report, which interviewed more than a 100 energy service companies, retail electricity service providers and distribution utilities. The research concluded that:
While energy service companies played an important role, they tended to reach primarily institutional and large commercial customers and showed little interest and ability to serve residential and small business customers. They also had difficulty serving industrial markets.
At the time, the competitive retail electricity suppliers had not demonstrated themselves to be effective vehicles for achieving energy efficiency improvements, due to a number of challenges, including: a high failure rate among supplier firms, a mixed interest in energy efficiency among suppliers, a lack of competitive electricity suppliers actually marketing tangible energy efficiency measures, and a lack of customer interest in obtaining energy efficiency from competitive suppliers.
Absent legislative or regulatory requirements, there was strong evidence that in a restructured electric industry, utility companies would not choose to provide substantive energy efficiency programs. If they provided anything at all, they were more likely to provide minimal ""information"" type programs, largely as a customer service and customer relations mechanism.
Similarly, in the 1990s some electricity markets were deregulated based on the theory that retail competition among power providers would lower costs and improve service (both energy efficiency and other services). MIT economist Paul Joskow reviewed these efforts in 2003 and found that “the performance of retail competition programs has been disappointing almost everywhere, especially for residential and small commercial customers.” This should serve as a cautionary tale, particularly for services for residential and small business energy consumers.
Financing
Likewise, some observers have suggested greater reliance on financing options, such as loans, rather than incentives. Financing is an important and useful tool, but while some customers will take out loans, others will not, for a variety of reasons ranging from poor credit rating, aversion to debt, or accounting procedures which make “on the books” financing difficult for some companies. The limitations of loan programs are documented by a 2011 ACEEE report that looked at many of the leading energy efficiency loan programs around the country, operated by a variety of organizations (including utilities, states, non-profit and for-profit organizations and financial institutions) and found only two that had served more than 5% of eligible participants. Limited interest in energy efficiency loans is confirmed by reports from private small lenders convened as part of ACEEE’s Small Lender Energy Efficiency Community (SLEEC).
Also, if funds available for incentives are limited, past experience indicates that most customers prefer direct rebates to subsidized loans. For example, Wisconsin Electric and Puget Power in the 1980s found that when commercial customers were offered a choice of a zero-interest loan or a rebate of the same value, over 90% chose the rebate (see p.158-159). There are older studies on residential customers that found 15-49% of customers preferred subsidized loans, with the rest preferring grants equal to the loan subsidy. If the goal of customer-funded efficiency programs is to reach the broad base of energy customers, financing efforts can’t be the only or even the primary tool for achieving that goal.
The cost problem
There is also a question of whether relying on the market will raise or lower costs. In the 1990s and early 2000s there were experiments in which bids were solicited for energy efficiency improvements and the least expensive viable options were chosen. Likewise there were “standard performance contracts” in which standardized incentives per kWh and/or kW-saved were offered to energy service companies and other private firms. In these efforts there was a tendency to get only certain types of savings, and for the prices to be relatively high. Specifically, the bids received tended to emphasize projects at large commercial and industrial facilities, with little for small businesses and only a modest amount for residential customers. The service providers targeted the largest customers because these customers provide large savings per successful marketing effort. Marketing costs tend to be high when you need to recruit many small customers and as a result most private sector energy efficiency firms have shied away from the small business market.
With bidding programs, the firms quickly learned what the market-clearing price was likely to be and then bid just below it. As a result, as shown in the graph below compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the bidding and performance contracting programs ranged in cost from about 5.5 to 8 cents/kWh saved. The average ratepayer-funded energy efficiency program had a total cost of about 4.4 cents/kWh saved, according to a report by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, when both program administrator and customer costs were included. In other words, the bidding programs have tended to be more expensive, not less. Not all market-based efforts will cost this much, but to date, evidence is lacking that market-based efforts will cost less.
  Cost per kWh Saved of U.S. Demand-Side Bidding and Standard Performance Contracting Programs
Source: Chuck Goldman, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, presentation to the Oregon Public Service Commission. http://www.puc.state.or.us/meetings/pmemos/2012/040512/Goldman.pdf. The red and light blue inner bars are the costs per kWh if the analysis includes savings for the full measure life and not just the contract term.
Cream skimming
In addition to concerns about costs, past experience indicates that left to their own devices, many private sector firms will tend to do ""cream skimming."" For example, a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study on the results of bidding found that these efforts emphasized lighting measures. These tended to be low-cost measures with a high return on investment, but that also only scratch the surface of cost-effective efficiency options. To address this, some programs established lower ceiling prices for lighting than for other measures, in order to encourage a diversity of approaches.
There are some markets where private suppliers of energy efficiency have done well, but many others where the success of market-only approaches has been limited. Financing approaches are useful because they can leverage private capital, stretching energy efficiency program funds further, and have proven useful for some customers. But the past indicates that markets alone will likely only reach a minority of customers, and only with some energy efficiency measures. Much more energy efficiency can be delivered if markets and energy efficiency programs work together.
Next, in the third blog in this series, I will talk more about paths forward, with an emphasis on recent and potential near- and medium-term developments that could potentially allow us to improve upon the results from the past. I will discuss areas where markets can lead and ways that markets and programs can work together to maximize positive synergies.

New national furnace standards will save consumers money, but stronger standards could save even more;"Yesterday, the US Department of Energy (DOE) issued a proposed rule for furnaces that would provide significant savings for consumers on their home heating bills, and be among the biggest natural-gas saving standards ever completed by the agency. The new standards would reduce gas and propane furnace energy consumption by about 13% relative to basic furnaces sold today.
Improved furnace efficiency standards are a crucial energy-savings opportunity for homeowners and the nation, since about one-fifth of all the energy consumed in US homes goes to operate gas and propane furnaces. These furnaces provide heat for more than 40% of homes, and their minimum efficiency standards have been virtually unchanged since 1992.
DOE’s analysis published yesterday shows that efficiency levels higher than those in the proposed rule would achieve even larger savings for consumers, and increase national energy savings by 50% compared to DOE’s proposal. The agency cited concerns about potential impacts on manufacturers to explain its selection of the lower proposed levels.
Based on DOE’s analysis, ASAP estimates that typical consumers would save $600 to $800 over the lifetime of a furnace meeting new standards, depending on the standard level. A preliminary DOE analysis published last fall showed that consumers save money in both northern and southern regions, whether purchasing their furnace for a newly built home or to replace an older furnace, and at either the proposed standard level or the higher potential level. An updated version will likely be released soon.
On a national level, furnaces meeting the proposed new standards sold over 30 years would save about 3.1 quadrillion Btus (quads) of energy—enough to meet the gas and propane heating needs of all of New England for 17 years—and net savings of $4-19 billion for consumers. The higher potential standards would save 4.4 quads, or enough to heat New England for 24 years, netting consumers up to $25 billion.
The current furnace standards can be met using non-condensing furnaces, which send much of the heat from the combustion process up the flue and cannot achieve efficiencies higher than about 80%. (For DOE standards, furnace efficiency is measured by calculating annual fuel utilization efficiency, or AFUE.) The new proposed standards could be met with condensing furnaces, which extract additional heat by condensing the water vapor in the flue gases, resulting in efficiency ratings of 90% or higher. Condensing furnaces make up about 45% of current sales.
Improved furnace standards have been a long time coming. Efficiency advocates and states sued DOE over the first revision completed in 2007, because it did very little to improve efficiency. As a result, the agency committed to redo the standard. In 2011, DOE completed a new standard based on a consensus agreement between manufacturers and efficiency advocates that would have raised the minimum efficiency level for furnaces effective in 2013, but only in the northern region. However, the American Public Gas Association (APGA) filed a lawsuit objecting to the expedited process used to adopt the 2011 standards. In 2014, a settlement agreement was approved that vacated the 2011 standards and required DOE to complete yet another new rulemaking. Yesterday’s proposed rule is a key step in the process for achieving improved standards.
Critics of improved furnace standards argued that the prior DOE analyses for the 2011 final rule failed to fully take into account potential switching to electric heat and the full impact of new furnace standards on the installation cost of new furnaces. The agency’s new analysis is substantially revised to address those critics’ concerns and now estimates that about 10% of furnace purchasers would switch to electric heat, primarily heat pumps, as a result of the standard. Most fuel switching would likely occur in those regions of the country where heat pumps are a cost-competitive option compared to gas heating. DOE also updated its estimates of installation costs. A small portion of consumers may face unusually high installation costs when replacing an 80% efficient furnace with a condensing product. ASAP and our allies have worked to develop approaches that would potentially exempt very high-cost installations and remain open to exploring options to provide relief for consumers facing unusually high installation costs. Fortunately, new venting technologies already are bringing down the cost of venting condensing furnaces in even the most difficult circumstances, and may make any special treatment unnecessary. Examples are here, here and here.
Yesterday’s proposed rule would apply to non-weatherized gas furnaces. Non-weatherized furnaces are the most common type and are located indoors, while weatherized furnaces are generally part of an outdoor unit that provides both heating and air conditioning. DOE completed standards for weatherized furnaces in 2011 that took effect on January 1 of this year.
DOE is required by the settlement agreement to publish a final rule for new efficiency standards for non-weatherized furnaces by April 2016, and the standards would take effect five years later. ASAP and our allies look forward to working with other stakeholders and DOE to come up with a final standard that will deliver on the large savings possible with improved standards.

Energy efficiency gamification: chicken fedoras and serious savings;"How far would you go to win an energy-saving contest? The Hall family of Bellevue, Washington turned off their lights, unplugged all nonessential appliances, brewed their coffee and cooked their meals outside, and used computers at the library instead of at home. In one month, they reduced their energy consumption by 94%, easily winning the grand prize—a $7,500 Lowe’s gift card—in the Be an Energy Rockstar contest sponsored by Puget Sound Energy. Students at Minnesota’s Carleton College went even further: they camped outside for the duration of their winter campus competition.
Other games inspire less extreme energy-saving strategies—and not just short-term ones. In the Ugliest Lighting Contest, the city of Palo Alto got its citizens to submit pictures of their most hideous incandescent or halogen lighting by offering the winner $400 toward an LED upgrade. The contest helped draw attention to the city’s many rebate programs for other efficiency upgrades, like appliances and solar panels. It was a quirky—and clever—strategy for raising awareness about something much larger than a light bulb.
These are just a few examples of the gamification of energy efficiency. Gamification—still a new enough term that my auto-correct always wants to change it to ""ramification""—refers to the strategy of turning a real-world activity into a game in order to make people more likely to do it.
ACEEE’s new report, Gamified Energy Efficiency Programs, focuses on this cutting-edge approach. We surveyed 53 games and apps from the US and around the world to see what made them tick and whether they actually did save energy.
We found several energy-saving games in which the winners achieved remarkable reductions: the energy Rock Stars of Bellevue, Washington (94% reduction), a San Diego family that won its city’s title of Biggest Energy Saver (46% reduction), the winner of Brooklyn's Reduce the Use (49% reduction), and the winning multifamily building in the Chicago Neighborhood Energy Challenge (34% reduction across electricity, gas, and water usage).
What really matters, though, is not the thriftiness of these individuals, but large-scale, sustainable savings through behavior change. Nine of the games we studied have compiled overall energy savings data indicating that savings of 3–6% are attainable among large groups, and that in smaller-scale, tightly targeted programs, savings of 10% are a potential goal. Some games even focus on appliance upgrades and other measures with long-term impact.
The best of these games and apps use some pretty ingenious strategies to motivate you to reduce your energy use. Take Leafully for example.
How many trees does it take to offset the carbon produced by the electricity you used last month? Leafully will tell you. Download this free app to a smartphone, tablet, or computer; then automatically import your utility bills, and Leafully will track your usage, alerting you when it’s abnormally high or impressively low, and telling you how much ""sleeping energy"" you're using (for appliances that can’t be shut off, like refrigerators). All this information is displayed as little green trees, reflecting the number of trees needed to sequester the carbon you produced (based on EPA calculations). Leafully can predict your personal savings from carpooling or upgrading an appliance; it can even help you offset your carbon emissions by purchasing renewable energy certificates.
Gamification can help whole communities save energy. In Brooklyn, city councilman Brad Lander encouraged energy saving among his constituents by entering himself in his district’s Reduce the Use competition. Every month, households received a statement showing not only how their energy use ranked compared to their neighbors, but also compared to Councilman Lander. When Lander’s bills went up or down, everyone knew about it.
In Vermont, teams representing towns compete every spring to win points for completing various challenges: saving energy, using reusable grocery bags, composting, changing transportation habits, and even making videos or writing about their efforts. You don’t even have to live in the state to play Vermontivate. Join a friend or relative’s team and your own sustainable actions can contribute to their success. They’ll probably even let you come to the end-of-game Ben and Jerry's ice cream party.
You may be wondering about the chicken fedoras in my title. That brings us to Energy Chickens. In this game you are responsible for the health and well-being of a small group of adorable chickens living on a virtual farm. The catch? Each chicken represents a light or electronic device in your office. Left your printer on all night? Prepare to see that chicken looking withered and green the next morning. Remembered to turn off your computer? That chicken will grow and thrive. Keep up the good energy-saving behavior and your chickens will start laying eggs, which you can use in the virtual general store to buy things like flowers, fruit bushes, gnomes, and yes, fedoras for your chickens. The more energy you save, the happier and more beautiful your chickens and farm will become.
Hats off to the creators of Energy Chickens, and to all the other seriously fun games in our new report.

Why we don’t have to choose between energy efficiency programs and market-driven solutions;"Part One in a series where ACEEE examines the most effective roles for energy efficiency programs and market-driven solutions in scaling the deployment of energy efficiency.
The fundamental question that policymakers ask themselves is, Are we being the most responsible stewards of public dollars? For those tasked with finding ways to increase cost-effective energy savings, the gold standard for the last 30 years has been ratepayer-funded programs administered by utilities, or in some cases, by state agencies or third parties. This model has worked very well, saving customers billions of dollars and helping to contain increases in energy prices.
In the search for even more effective policy solutions, some have periodically asked if states and utilities should bow out and allow private-sector service providers in the market to completely take over. The reasoning is that the energy efficiency market will never mature as long as energy efficiency programs exist, so we must choose between these programs and the private sector. Our belief, founded on over 30 years of research, is that this is a false choice: private-sector providers are already the dominant player when it comes to energy efficiency, and energy efficiency programs still fulfill a vital role due to their proven track record of success and the impediments to energy efficiency that they address.
An extensive body of research documents the many factors that result in customers' underutilization of energy efficiency in the absence of energy efficiency programs. These factors include a lack of information, the scarcity of high-efficiency options in the local market, local suppliers' and contractors' lack of training and experience in the latest high-efficiency techniques, customer economic payback requirements that are vastly different than the utility system, the hassle factor of having to arrange an energy efficiency retrofit, and split incentives between building owners and tenants. Well-designed energy efficiency programs help overcome these barriers and allow private-market actors to provide their services more effectively.
This partnership between markets and programs should not be abandoned. As we discuss below, our research indicates that at the present time, private service providers alone will deliver less energy savings than if they continue to work together with successful energy efficiency programs. That said, we are excited about the possibilities of leveraging even more private-sector dollars and activity in the future as a vital complement to customer-funded programs.
In our research we find that the private market has done a lot to promote energy efficiency in the past, and even more may be possible in the future. There are some market segments, such as large institutions, where the private market has done well, but many others where the success of market-focused approaches has been limited. We should encourage the private market where it works well and experiment with new market-based approaches in other promising market segments. But we should also continue to use proven approaches like energy efficiency programs, transitioning to alternative approaches only when such alternatives prove their efficacy in specific market segments. If we reduce proven program approaches prematurely, energy efficiency savings will likely be lower, consumer costs higher, and impacts on the environment more severe.
This blog post is the first in a multipart series on these issues. Today’s blog post summarizes our findings but does not include the underlying details. In the coming weeks we will publish two additional posts: one on our findings from past programs, and one looking at recent developments and potential opportunities ahead. Subsequent posts in this series will look into the role of financing and the New York REV proposal in particular.
Our findings can be summarized in five points.
The market is already a major force in delivering energy efficiency.
A 2013 ACEEE study estimated that about $70–100 billion was spent in 2010 on energy efficiency measures, with a substantial majority of this funding coming from the private market. Well-developed and well-deployed energy efficiency programs leverage and enhance the role of private retailers and service providers. Utility incentives typically cover a third to half of the cost of measures, leaving end users to pay the rest. Efficiency measures are mostly purchased through privately-owned stores and service providers. And many customers will invest in efficiency without utility or government involvement. The question is not whether to rely on the market, since we already do that; the question is whether we can rely even more on the market in the future.
Energy efficiency programs have a record of cost-effective success.
Energy efficiency programs have done a very good job of improving energy efficiency cost effectively. Utilities and other program implementers began offering energy-efficiency programs in the 1980s because it generally cost less to save a kWh of energy than to build a power plant and generate a kWh. These programs have ramped up since then and are now offered in most states. According to data compiled by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), these programs reduced electricity use by about 138 billion kWh in 2012, enough to power more than 13 million average American homes for a year. A 2014 ACEEE study found that on average, these programs cost utilities 2.8 cents per kWh saved, which is less than half the cost of new generating plants. The EIA data show that some states have used energy efficiency programs to reduce energy use by more than 10% over multiyear periods.
Past experience shows us the pitfalls of abandoning energy efficiency programs.
It is instructive to look at times when policymakers sought to rely more on markets. For example, there was a major push for market-based solutions in the 1990s. A 2001 ACEEE evaluation of these efforts found that private-sector energy service companies could play an important role, but they primarily reached institutional and large commercial customers and showed little interest in and ability to serve residential and small business customers. They also had limited success serving industrial markets.
Likewise, the retail electricity commodity supplier industry did not show itself to be an effective vehicle for achieving energy efficiency improvements, due to such challenges as a high failure rate among supplier firms, their mixed interest in energy efficiency, their minimal effort to actually market tangible energy efficiency measures, and a lack of customer interest in obtaining energy efficiency from them. This period also saw experiments in which bids were solicited for energy efficiency improvements and ""standard performance contracts"" were offered; in both cases private firms received payments per kWh and/or kW saved. These experiments tended to yield only certain types of savings (such as lighting improvements) and relatively high prices—higher per kWh saved than the cost of utility-operated programs.
So far we also have seen limitations in the energy efficiency financing market. We agree that financing is an important and useful tool, and we encourage efforts to experiment with new strategies in order to extend financing's reach. However, financing should not be the only tool in our kitbag. Lack of access to capital is just one of the key barriers to energy efficiency, and not all customers want to or can access financing. Many firms currently have large cash reserves, and capital is available for low-risk customers at very attractive rates. For other customers, past experience indicates that while some of them will take out loans, others will not for a variety of reasons. These may include a poor credit rating, aversion to debt, or financial procedures that make on-the-books financing difficult for some companies. This limited use of loans is documented in a 2011 ACEEE report that looks at leading energy efficiency loan programs around the country and is also illustrated by reports from private small lenders convened as part of ACEEE’s Small Lender Energy Efficiency Community (SLEEC).
The future of the energy efficiency market is promising, although not a universal solution.
It is also important to look at what may be possible in the present and near future—and what may not. The past decade has seen market and technology developments that could enhance the role of market players in future years. For example, energy service companies have refined their offerings and now are doing nearly $6 billion a year in business, primarily in energy-saving performance contracts that guarantee a level of savings, often for ten years or more. These contracts are still primarily with institutional customers, with many fewer commercial and industrial customers and very little in the residential sector. There are also new smart thermostats available for homes that, while expensive, have been popular with early adopters. And in the commercial sector, new smart building services can help optimize building operations , saving 10% or more in some applications.
These are promising developments, but still only a fraction of the 20% plus savings opportunity from cost-effective energy efficiency measures that studies have found. In addition, these service providers tend to emphasize the largest businesses and upscale consumers, meaning that many customers are not receiving services.
The best results come from the market and energy efficiency programs working together.
Cooperation between the market and energy efficiency programs often produces the best results. For example, quite a few energy efficiency programs have promoted smart thermostats, contributing to their market growth. The Connecticut Green Bank has undertaken more than 20 projects with Commercial Property-Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) finance; most of these projects have also received rebates from energy efficiency programs. The ENERGY STAR® program has helped increase the market share of energy-efficient equipment, aided by program promotion efforts and incentives. Energy efficiency programs have also helped to advance efficiency in new construction by working with developers, architects, and engineers. We will provide further information on these and other examples in the third post in this series.
We believe the fundamental question is not which approach works best—markets or energy efficiency programs—but how to build upon a cooperative endeavor that has proven itself effective and that is already providing billions of dollars of energy savings. Look for subsequent posts in our series on this topic. We also encourage you to join the conversation in the comments section below; we will try to reply to as many posts as we can.

Electric Cars Gain Ground in Environmental Vehicle Rankings;"Smart ForTwo Electric Drive Tops Greenest Vehicles List; American Electric Vehicles Make a Strong Showing
Washington, DC—Today at greenercars.org, ACEEE released its 18th annual comprehensive environmental ratings for vehicles. The publication of the 2015 ratings coincides with the release of ACEEE’s brand new greenercars.org website that will now offer subscription-free access to all vehicle scores from model year 2000 and later.
The following vehicles comprise the Greenest List for 2015:
The Smart ForTwo Electric Drive tops the Greenest List once again this year with the highest Green Score ever. Toyota’s Prius Plug-in and original Prius perform exceedingly well again in 2015, jointly taking spot #6. The original Prius also scores a 54 (but is not listed on the Greenest). At #10, the Mitsubishi Mirage was the sole conventional vehicle to earn a spot on the list this year, although the conventional Smart ForTwo is not listed only because its all-electric counterpart had already claimed a spot on the Greenest List. Six out of 12 places in this year’s Greenest List were claimed by plug-in electric vehicles.
“As the electric vehicle market continues to develop, we’re seeing a number of different options from a variety of automakers, including several from American manufacturers,” said ACEEE lead vehicle analyst Shruti Vaidyanathan.
Electric vehicles claimed additional spots on this year’s Greenest List largely due to the inclusion of one vehicle that just missed a spot on our 2014 Greenest List (the Ford Focus Electric), as well as two vehicles that were left off the list last year due to low sales volume (the Spark EV and Fiat 500E). Two mid-size vehicles also appear on the Greenest List: the Nissan Leaf and Toyota Prius Plug-in, indicating that green need not mean small. This year’s list also features a diverse array of manufacturers: nine different automakers are represented by the 12 top-scoring vehicles, including two American manufacturers (Chevrolet and Ford) and two European manufacturers.
At the same time, it’s important to note that some of the Greenest are only being offered in a handful of states, and that the larger classes are not represented. Hence greenercars.org also identifies practical options among the top widely available, automatic transmission, petroleum-fueled models. The Greener Choices list includes trucks and SUVs, such as the Ford F-150, the Chevrolet Trax, and the Nissan Quest. The gasoline-powered Chevrolet Spark and Honda Fit top their respective car classes. As the list demonstrates, consumers can make greener choices whatever their vehicle needs may be. Domestic manufacturers claimed five of the 12 Greener Choices spots:
Greenercars.org provides the facts necessary to examine the eco-performance of any 2015 model. The site assigns each vehicle a Green Score, a single measure that incorporates lifecycle greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions. Updates to this year’s methodology include the incorporation of a fuel cell vehicle analysis and a new estimate of nuclear damage costs.
This year, in addition to providing Green Scores for electric vehicles based on the national average grid mix, greenercars.org will include a downloadable spreadsheet tool that will allow users to calculate region-specific Green Scores for electric vehicles based on their local grid mix, along with annual fuel cost estimates using regional electricity prices.
“How green your electric vehicle is has a lot to do with where you plug it in. A car that is charged using electricity generated from natural gas or renewables is going to have significantly less impact on the environment than one charged on a coal-heavy grid,” said Vaidyanathan.
The Meanest List this year is comprised of heavier medium-duty vehicles and European sports cars that are the least friendly to the environment:
In addition to highlighting the year’s Greenest,Meanest,Greener Choices, and best-in-class lists, the greenercars.org website features informative write-ups on model year 2015 highlights, a consumer primer on vehicles and the environment, and advice on how to buy green when shopping for a new car or truck.
Green Scores of the 1,000+ configurations of all model year 2015 vehicles are available for free in the greenercars.org interactive database, along with each configuration’s fuel economy, health-related pollution impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions. Visitors to the database can also build custom lists for comparing vehicles.

Energy efficiency and community resilience: making the connection to keep the lights on and our homes warm;"Communities face a growing number of stresses that pose risks to their energy systems and economies. These include aging infrastructure in need of costly maintenance upgrades and severe weather events. Energy efficiency is a strategy—albeit not a broadly recognized one—to enhance the resilience of energy systems and the communities they serve. One example is the role that CHP played during Superstorm Sandy to keep the power on at critical facilities, including hospitals and universities, when 8.5 million customers lost power. But efficiency could also be key to community resilience in less obvious ways, including helping communities to weather economic stresses. For example, natural gas customers in Massachusetts are paying more on their bills this winter because insufficient transmission infrastructure in the state is leading to congestion in the transmission system. Natural gas efficiency programs would help natural gas customers avoid paying these high congestion prices and allow them to spend more on other potential needs, further improving community resilience.
Communities that embrace energy efficiency are more “resource resilient.” That is, energy efficiency reduces a community’s natural resources demands, enabling it to instead spend its income on needs that directly benefit the local economy, including other resilience measures. Take energy efficiency improvements in homes. They make communities more resilient in several ways: spending on efficiency creates more economic activity and jobs; buildings have increased economic value, durability, and safety in case of disaster; energy savings from improvements means fewer emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, improving public health; and smaller and less volatile energy bills allows households to spend their money in more beneficial ways.
ACEEE is kicking off a new research project this year to identify the connection between efficiency and resilience, and to identify opportunities for integrating energy efficiency into resilience strategies. As part of our research report, we’ll explore how efficiency can be specifically implemented to enhance resilience and which specific efficiency measures result in what resilience benefits. For example, what do investments in improved public transit systems mean for community resilience? Or which specific efficiency measures implemented by water utilities result in which resilience benefits? We’ll also work to determine which metrics are appropriate to measure efficiency-related resilience, and explore the opportunities in policy and program development to integrate efficiency into resilience efforts and vice versa.
We anticipate releasing our research report this coming summer. We are very interested in your thoughts, as members of the energy efficiency and resilience communities, on how you view the efficiency-resilience interconnection. We’re interested to hear your suggestions about valuable literature, case studies, potential metrics, and policy and program opportunities. Those interested should feel free to e-mail me.

Fewer dollars up the chimney with DOE’s proposal for gas fireplaces;"Proposed new standards for gas fireplaces may make a cozy night in front of the fire a little cheaper. For decorative hearth products, the little blue flame that stands ready to light your gas fireplace at a moment’s notice can account for about 40% of the total annual energy consumed. Standing pilots lights are on 24/7, continuously burning small amounts of gas and sending dollars needlessly up your chimney. A proposed rule issued by the Department of Energy (DOE) yesterday would eliminate this waste with new energy-saving standards. ­­But don’t fret—with the energy-saving technology, you’ll still be able start up your romantic, cozy, or mood-setting fireplace with the press of a button or turn of a knob.
DOE estimates that the proposed standards would net the average consumer $165 in savings over the life of the product. On a national level, hearth products meeting the new standards sold over 30 years would reduce natural gas consumption by about 7 billion therms, which is equivalent to the annual natural gas consumption of 10 million US households, and net consumers up to $3 billion in savings. Over the same period, the standards would reduce CO2 emissions by 37 million metric tons, an amount equal to the annual emissions of more than 3 million US homes
The proposed standards, the first for hearth products, apply to all vented or ventless hearth products including space heating hearth products, decorative products, gas logs, gas stoves, and outdoor hearth products. The standards would require manufacturers to eliminate the continuously burning pilot light. Many products already use electronic ignition—similar to what is used on gas ranges and ovens—eliminating the need for wasteful pilot lights.
A final rule is expected in December 2015 with an expected effective date five years later.

Study Finds Global Opportunities for Greater Elevator Efficiency;"Chicago—More energy-efficient elevators can significantly reduce the costs of operating a building, but the information needed to help building owners identify the appropriate elevator system—and the savings associated with it—aren’t readily available, according to a new study published by a leading policy group. The study, by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, was published with the support of UTC Building & Industrial Systems, the parent organization of Otis, the world’s largest manufacturer and maintainer of people-moving products.
Elevators and escalators make up 2 to 5 percent of the energy used in most buildings, but can reach as high as 50 percent during peak operational times. At 5 percent, that means the yearly energy consumption of U.S. elevators is approximately five times of that used in all of Washington D.C. The technology exists today to reduce that consumption by 40 percent or more, especially by cutting energy use between trips, when an elevator is idle, according to the study. Some technologies have been found to reduce consumption by as much as 75 percent, but without a standard way to measure energy savings and a rating system to distinguish more efficient elevators, building owners may be unaware of the benefits of upgrading to a more efficient system or choosing a more efficient system for new construction.
“Enhanced visibility when it comes to elevator efficiency can help customers grasp the full value package of better controls, improved performance, reduced sound, and increased comfort,” said Harvey Sachs, ACEEE senior fellow, and the study’s lead author. Sameer Kwatra of ACEEE presented the study on Tuesday, January 27 at the 2015 American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Winter Conference in Chicago.
The study lays out a framework for industry leaders to set common standards for measuring elevator efficiency. Those standards could lead to a rating system, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR® ratings already in place for heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems, and many home appliances. Clear standards also could lead energy utilities and government agencies to offer incentives, such as rebates, for very efficient models. And building label programs, such as the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED® program, could include elevator efficiency as a factor in certifying buildings. Right now, the LEED program considers elevators a part of unregulated “process loads,” and there are no direct credits for installing more efficient systems.
“Owners see elevators as an extension of the building lobby — a way to include their personality and values in the building,” said John Mandyck, chief sustainability officer, UTC Building & Industrial Systems. “As consumers and tenants better understand and value the effects green buildings have on the health and productivity of inhabitants, clear standards for measuring elevator efficiency can provide a great opportunity to reduce operating costs and showcase the environmental attributes of a building.”
The report identified energy-efficient elevator technologies that can be included in building codes and factored in elevator rating and labeling systems. As almost all elevators are idle far more than they are moving, reducing standby power, such as by turning off lights and cab ventilation systems, can be relatively inexpensive and dramatically cut total energy use. In addition, new technologies, such as coated steel belts that replace cable ropes in some elevators, allow for more efficient operation. Advanced dispatching software can improve the customer experience by reducing wait time while cutting energy use in half compared to traditional systems, according to the report.
The UTC Building & Industrial Systems grant required ACEEE to work completely independently, and to consult as many industry experts from as many firms as feasible, including manufacturers, consultants, and the press.

Fuel economy standards will propel America’s vehicle technology, if we let them.;"In his State of the Union address, President Obama rightly pointed to a thriving domestic auto industry as a bright spot in the U.S. economy. It’s a good time to recall that the government’s 2008-2009 intervention on behalf of GM and Chrysler played a big role in that outcome, as did energy efficiency.
The domestic industry’s inability to deliver high quality, fuel-efficient cars was a major factor in the dire financial situation that led to the two bankruptcies. So, in the course of the government-assisted restructuring, the auto industry endorsed the administration’s ambitious new Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, projected to nearly double the fuel economy of cars and light trucks by 2025, when they were proposed in 2011.
Yet, at this year’s Detroit Auto Show, manufacturers left little doubt they would seek to weaken the 2025 CAFE standards in the upcoming “midterm review” of the program. They argue that low gas prices will keep consumers from buying the advanced vehicles needed to meet the standards. But in fact, the standards rely very little on sales of electric or other advanced technology vehicles. The vast majority of fuel economy gains between now and 2025 are expected to come from gradual improvements to conventional vehicles: better engines, advanced transmissions, mass reduction. The role of CAFE standards is to ensure that all manufacturers adopt such advances across their product lines, even as fuel prices fluctuate.
While the standards can keep technology moving forward, they can’t stem enthusiasm for larger vehicles when gas prices plummet. It is important to realize that such episodes will not prevent manufacturers from meeting the standards, because mile-per-gallon targets under CAFE decline if the size of vehicles grows. A bigger fleet will, however, erode the fuel savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions of the CAFE program.
That problem calls for a different solution. As many have noted, today’s low fuel prices offer a great opportunity to rethink the federal gasoline tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon for over two decades. A $3-per-gallon floor on the pump price of gasoline would bolster auto manufacturers’ confidence in their technology investments and nudge consumers towards more fuel-efficient and predictable vehicle purchase and travel choices. It’s tempting to suggest using the resulting revenue to fill the gaping hole in the Highway Trust Fund. But first, let’s see whether the new Congress takes note of the shifts in Americans’ travel habits as they set priorities for infrastructure investment in this year’s transportation bill.

Expanding the energy efficiency pie through high program participation;"Energy efficiency programs serving utility customers have grown rapidly over the past decade. While the rates of growth may have slowed in the last couple of years, most states have policies in place to achieve higher and higher energy savings from utility energy efficiency programs. In order to achieve high energy savings, program administrators can follow two key strategies: (1) get more customers to participate, and (2) get more savings from each participating customer. A report released today by ACEEE examines this first strategy—achieving high program participation. We examined a set of prevalent program types to identify programs that have achieved high participation and better understand the challenges with data and nomenclature. We also wanted to identify program areas that are ripe for growth in participation rates.
Participation rates are key variables for estimating the future potential savings of energy efficiency programs, especially for efficiency program plans and integrated resource planning. Participation rates also are key metrics for tracking past program results. Program administrators, evaluators and regulators need accurate tracking of program participation to evaluate program impacts and success.
But while program participation is simple in principle, it is complex in practice. We found that despite the importance of participation data within many aspects of efficiency (such as potential studies, program planning, implementation, and evaluation), it’s not reported consistently or completely. There are no industry standards and conventions for defining and measuring participation. Definitions and nomenclature used to report participation metrics vary significantly, although there is generally greater consistency of such metrics for a given type of program.
Despite these data challenges, we identified many examples of programs that have achieved high participation. Programs serving mass markets, such as residential customers shopping for lighting products, can move millions of products annually. The cumulative result is that in some markets energy-efficient lighting comprises 40% of all household lighting. Other programs serve much smaller markets with more specialized needs, such as industrial customers or commercial builders. Leading new commercial construction programs may reach 50-60% of all new projects. Some programs providing custom incentives to the largest commercial and industrial customers have achieved 50-70% participation over several years. Other types of programs, such as those serving small- to medium-size manufacturers, are ripe for growth in participation rates (another ACEEE report documents successful practices for reaching this sector).
The keys to high participation are not too surprising. They are simply the fundamentals of successful energy efficiency programs: (1) good program design that makes participation easy and offers a range of services valued by customers, (2) attractive incentives, and (3) effective and innovative marketing to targeted customer segments.
Our research reveals that an ever-growing number of utility customers are already participating in energy efficiency programs, and many more could participate. The resulting energy savings are expanding the utility energy efficiency resource pie—a resource that reduces utility system demand and corresponding costs. Participating customers receive the direct benefits of improved energy efficiency while all customers receive the broader system benefits, such as lower pollution and job creation, that cost-effective energy efficiency programs can provide.
This broader view of program participation is important as we seek to achieve a variety of economic and environmental goals through improved energy efficiency. Program participation needs to be seen through the lenses of overall portfolios and applicable markets over long periods. In leading regions with longstanding programs, a majority of customers have benefited directly from participating in available programs. In this way program administrators are expanding the pie of energy savings through improved energy efficiency, enabling ever more customers to share this important resource and collectively contribute to a cleaner energy economy.

Assessing favorability for CHP deployment in your state;"Here at ACEEE we are big fans of combined heat and power (CHP). It’s energy efficient, it helps with resiliency, and it could be a key strategy for complying with carbon pollution reduction requirements. Each year, as part of the State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, we rank states on policies that encourage deployment of CHP. With each iteration, we review our scoring methodology and collect information on the environment facing CHP developers. As with all of our metrics, scoring of CHP in the State Scorecard focuses on states’ policies, which is only one element that influences the favorability of a state to CHP development.
In a recent blog post, we looked for a correlation between 2014 CHP State Scorecard scores and actual new CHP installations as a simple way to examine the overall relationship between policy and deployment. While the results indicate a moderate correlation between scores and deployment, some inconsistencies exist in states where CHP installations have stayed low despite numerous supportive policies being on the books for many years.
We know that state policies are only a piece of the puzzle when it comes to CHP. A variety of economic factors influence deployment—most importantly, the financial attractiveness of individual CHP investments to host facilities. One of the biggest factors influencing economic attractiveness is the retail price of energy. In states with very low electricity prices, it is often more economical to buy electricity from the grid than to generate electricity onsite with CHP. By contrast, higher electricity prices can make the case for onsite generation with CHP more favorable. Similarly, lower and more stable natural gas prices offer cheaper fuel costs that can improve the economics for CHP.
To get a rough look at the degree to which prices influence the CHP market in a given state, we developed a state-by-state CHP favorability index using information we collected for our 2014 State Scorecard project and for another recent analysis. In that analysis, we estimated the CHP potential achievable in each state using publicly available data from ICF International. Then, we used sector- and state-specific electricity and gas prices forecasted by EIA from 2016 to 2030 and operating characteristics of the potential CHP in each state, which yielded an adjusted CHP potential that includes only those projects that remain cost-effective under future forecasts. The ratio of our original “ACEEE Estimated Achievable CHP potential” to the estimated potential that was adjusted for cost-effectiveness is a market favorability index, which tells us how favorable electricity and gas prices are to the future business case for CHP in a given state.
Recognizing that better policies yield overall improvements in project economics, such as when improved interconnection standards yield reduced costs, we also developed a policy metric using 2014 State Scorecard scores as a proxy for such regulatory factors. This policy favorability index tells us how favorable the existing policy environment is for CHP in a given state. The figure below shows the market favorability index side-by-side with the policy favorability index for twelve Midwestern states.
Midwest CHP favorability index
Seven of the Midwest states show an extremely high level of market favorability for CHP deployment, coupled with only moderate to low levels of policy activity. Future state policy and regulatory action is likely to have the greatest impact in states such as Wisconsin, Illinois, and Ohio, where the market favorability index is high and the groundwork for policy measures are in place. Michigan is an example of a state where, due to unfavorable economic conditions, CHP installations are unlikely to increase despite having supportive policies in place. However, in a state such as Nebraska, which has favorable economics, policies like those in Michigan or Wisconsin could result in greater deployment.
Advocates often wonder why the volume of investments in CHP falls short of their estimated potential. The favorability index may answer this by giving us a glimpse of the impact of market and policy favorability on the potential capacity for CHP installations in a state. In the figure below, we show the original ACEEE-estimated achievable CHP potential by 2030 for each state in yellow. In blue, we apply the market favorability index to existing potential to demonstrate how market conditions can prevent some potential CHP installations from occuring. Finally, in gray, we apply both the policy and market favorability index to existing potential to demonstrate how market conditions and regulatory barriers lower potential CHP penetration.
Impact of market and policy favorability on CHP potential
In the figure, accounting for market conditions (in blue) actually does little to diminish the CHP potential in the majority of Midwest states. This suggests that even when the economics are there, it is a lack of supportive state policy (in gray) that is largely responsible for affecting investments in new CHP projects.
We think the CHP favorability index concept that we’ve presented here can be a useful tool for CHP developers, policymakers, and advocates to use in their discussions. It highlights states where policy changes can make a difference, and where they probably will not. We would be remiss if we did not mention, as a caveat, that both indices exclude certain economic considerations beyond energy prices that can also impact market favorability for CHP. However, the approach represents a start at visualizing the interplay between policies and economic factors influencing CHP deployment and gives us a new way of discussing this subject. We look forward to receiving comments on the usefulness of this tool.

How energy efficiency investment creates a ripple effect of multiple benefits for businesses beyond energy savings;"Everyone knows that energy efficiency results in saving energy, but evidence points to an array of wider benefits. The term “multiple benefits” has emerged to describe the additional value that emerges with any energy performance improvement. The benefits that occur onsite can be especially meaningful to manufacturing, commercial, and institutional facilities. Energy efficiency’s positive ripple effects include increased productivity and product quality, system reliability, and more. Business leaders take note: the bonus value of energy efficiency’s multiple benefits amplifies the return on energy efficiency investments.
Over the past few decades, researchers have documented numerous cases of energy efficiency improvements—almost always focusing exclusively on energy savings. Non-energy benefits are often recognized, but only in concept. ACEEE’s new report, Multiple Benefits of Business-Sector Energy Efficiency, summarizes what we know about the multiple benefits for the business sector. True quantification of these benefits remains elusive due to a lack of standard definitions, measurements, and documentation, but also in part because variations in business facility design and function ensures that a comprehensive list of potential energy efficiency measures is long, varied, and often unique to the facility.
To give some concrete examples of non-energy benefits at work: Optimizing the use of steam in a plywood manufacturing plant not only reduces the boiler’s natural gas consumption, it also improves the rate of throughput, thus increasing the plant’s daily product yield. A lighting retrofit reduces electricity consumption while also introducing lamps with a longer operating life, thus reducing the labor costs associated with replacing lighting. In many instances, monitoring energy use also provides insights into water or raw material usage, thereby revealing opportunities to optimize manufacturing inputs and eliminate production waste. By implementing energy efficiency, businesses can also boost their productivity. This additional value may make the difference in a business leader’s decision to pursue certain capital investment for their facility.
Meanwhile, energy resource planners at utilities and public utility commissions recognize the impact of large-facility energy demands on the cost and reliability of generation and transmission assets. By maximizing consumer efficiency, costs are reduced or offset throughout a utility system. So the ability to quantify the multiple benefits of investing in energy efficiency, if only in general terms, is an appealing prospect for resource planners eager to encourage greater participation in efficiency programs.
Unfortunately, our research shows that this quantification rarely happens, even though the multiple benefits are frequently evident. A number of studies offer measurement methodologies, anticipating the availability of proper data. When these methodologies are employed with limited samples, we see how proper accounting of non-energy benefits dramatically improves the investment performance of energy efficiency improvements—for example, improving payback times by 50% or better. Samples may provide impressive results, but the data remains too shallow to confidently infer the value to come for any single project type implemented in a specific industrial configuration. Developing such metrics will require more data.
To that end, we describe an ideal resource that would allow an analyst or investor to infer multiple benefit values for any energy efficiency improvement proposal. Of course, the data requirements for such an exercise are staggering—not only for the volume required, but also for its collection and codification. Progress toward this goal will require some intermediate steps. For one, stakeholders require a protocol for defining and measuring non-energy benefits. The vast majority of such data would be self-reported by facility management professionals who will need guidance, perhaps from a template to facilitate their assimilation of the appropriate data.
This report represents the first phase of our analysis of energy efficiency’s multiple benefits. We will begin our second phase later this month, and are looking for sponsors and advisors to help shape definition, measurement, and reporting protocols.

2014 was a good year for energy efficiency. The outlook for 2015 is uncertain, but we’re guardedly optimistic.;"The New Year is usually a good time to take stock of the year just ended, and to look forward to the year ahead. Regarding energy efficiency, 2014 was generally a good year. Energy-saving technologies and practices continued to advance. For example, in 2014 LED lighting became a mainstream source of light. The Design Lights Consortium now lists more than 70,000 LED lighting products. And a recent DOE report estimates that by 2020, LED lighting will account for about 48% of product sales.
Similarly, intelligent efficiency—using sensors, controls, software, and “big data” to identify sources of energy waste in real time and enable quick solutions—is poised for rapid growth with multiple firms now offering intelligent efficiency services in the commercial sector, and new smart thermostat products from Honeywell and others as direct competition to Nest. Many of these developments were presented at ACEEE’s November Intelligent Efficiency Conference.
There were also policy advances, including the completion of multiple new federal energy efficiency standards that collectively will save consumers more than $50 billion, the inclusion of energy efficiency in the proposed standard regulating greenhouse gases from existing power plants, and the president’s order to set new fuel efficiency standards for large trucks .
States and cities also generally made progress on energy efficiency. For example, utility investments in and savings from energy efficiency programs continue to increase. On the other hand, there were rollbacks of efficiency efforts in Florida,Indiana, and Ohio, and the U.S. Congress could not enact even modest energy efficiency legislation.
For 2015, the outlook is uncertain, but we’re guardedly optimistic. Energy saving technologies and practices will continue to advance. For example, we see the coming year as a pivotal one for zero-net-energy buildings. Several states will be considering improvements to their energy efficiency policies, including Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania.
Congressional leaders, such as Senator John Hoeven (R-ND), have signaled an openness to energy efficiency provisions, quite possibly as part of broader energy legislation. EPA will be finalizing their emissions standards for existing power plants, and energy efficiency is likely to play a major role, spurring additional state actions in future years. New truck efficiency standards that the president promised last year will be formally proposed this year. And DOE is planning to finalize new efficiency standards for many important products this year. To provide just one example, a new standard will be finalized for commercial rooftop air conditioners. DOE estimates that the draft standard will save businesses $16-50 billion.
On the other hand, Arizona and New York are considering proposals that could reduce their commitment to energy efficiency. And some members of the new congressional majority are pledging to use appropriations riders and other techniques to slow the president’s climate change agenda, which could affect some energy efficiency initiatives.
ACEEE has a very active 2015 planned. We’ll be hosting a record seven conferences. Topics will include market transformation, energy efficiency finance, energy efficiency as a utility system resource, and industrial energy efficiency. We have about 30 research reports planned. Some of the areas we will be examining include: non-energy benefits, intelligent efficiency, new energy efficiency opportunities in buildings, industry and transportation, measuring the jobs benefits of energy efficiency, the business case for utility investments in energy efficiency, links between resiliency and energy efficiency, programs with high participation rates, and best practices for municipal utilities and for low-income programs. In addition, our City Energy Efficiency Scorecard will be published in late spring, and our State Energy Efficiency Scorecard will be published in the fall.
Overall, energy efficiency is a bipartisan issue that has made progress under both Democrats and Republicans, a track record we hope and expect to continue. Energy efficiency makes progress each year and those incremental steps steadily add up.

Conquering the evening peak;"As you may know, I’ve been thinking about issues relating to the utility of the future, as documented in our June 2014 report. The report mentions, but does not emphasize, a potential emerging trend that could have a large impact on many utilities: the reduction of the traditional mid-afternoon peak, and the growth of an evening peak. (Peak is the time when demand for power is highest.)
In many regions, evening peaks have been growing, as more consumers install air conditioners and operate them when they get home from work. But two other factors are augmenting this trend. First and foremost is the growth in consumer-owned photovoltaic systems. These systems generate the most power on sunny afternoons, which is about when the traditional early afternoon peak occurs. But when the sun goes down, extra power is quickly needed to replace this solar power. Recent and projected data from Hawaii (where photovoltaic ownership is much higher than any other state) shows these effects. Even in 2012 photovoltaic systems likely depressed the afternoon peak in Hawaii.
Source: http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/hawaiis-solar-grid-landscape-and-the-nessie-curve.
Second, and probably less significant, is that growing electric vehicle ownership could exacerbate this effect if consumers routinely recharge their vehicles when they get home from work. Overnight charging would not contribute to this problem.
There are many ways to address the growing evening peak, including the following:
Energy efficiency, particularly measures that reduce the evening peak such as efficient lamps, water heaters, stoves and ovens.
Smart controllers that minimize energy use during the evening peak. To provide just one example, a smart refrigerator would not turn on the defrost cycle during this period and might even turn off the main compressor for a few minutes. Likewise, smart charging systems for electric vehicles could be used, such as a new system recently demonstrated by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), working with a consortium of utilities and auto manufacturers.
Expanded use of demand-response programs to lower the new peak (and coordination of these efforts with energy efficiency programs).
Time-of-use rates and/or demand charges that raise the price of power use during peak times and a lower them at off-peak times.
Use of energy storage at a system, community, or end-user level. Storage able to provide power for several hours could be very useful.
Fast ramp-up generation to serve the evening peak and other times when renewable energy production plummets, for example when the wind dies down. Hydro is ideal, but fast ramp-up gas units are now entering the market.
In my opinion, the time of the peak will change in many regions. The shift will be gradual in most areas, so we have time to address it. Rather than trying to stop this change by restricting photovoltaic systems, we'll be better off figuring out how to manage it, taking advantage of the time we have.

The Rebound Effect: Real, but Not Very Large;"As the energy efficiency of products, homes, and businesses improves, it becomes less expensive to operate them. The rebound effect postulates that people increase their use of products and facilities as a result of this reduction in operating costs, thereby reducing the energy savings achieved. Periodically, some analysts raise questions about the rebound effect, arguing that it is a major factor that needs to be accounted for when analyzing energy efficiency programs. The most recent example is a report by the Institute for Energy Research, an organization that primarily works on oil, gas, coal, and electricity markets. In order to address these recurring arguments, today ACEEE released a white paper entitled The Rebound Effect: Large or Small? The paper is written in a “question and answer” format designed to summarize what we know, what we do not, and—given what we know—how large the rebound effect is likely to be. The paper examines both direct and indirect rebound effects.
Direct rebound is the impact of a purchase of an efficient product by purchasers’ use of that product. For example, a car buyer may drive an efficient car more often than an inefficient one or a homeowner who weatherizes his/her house may use a portion of the savings to increase the temperature in the house in the winter to increase comfort.
Indirect rebound, on the other hand, reflects the impact of re-spending the money that consumers and businesses save from improved energy efficiency. It can also include the fact that as factories and other parts of the economy get more efficient, production costs may be lower, freeing up funds to expand the factory and increasing demand for products. An example of the former is a household that cuts its heating bill and takes back a little of the savings on higher thermostat settings, but then spends the remaining money saved on eating out or buying a new flat screen television. An example of the latter is that efficiency improvements in aluminum smelting can reduce the price of aluminum, thereby fostering increased aluminum sales that requires additional energy consumption in its production.
There have been more than 100 studies published that attempt to estimate rebound effects, many of which we examined for our paper. We found that while there is some uncertainty, available evidence indicates that direct rebound effects will generally be 10% or less. Estimates of higher direct rebound effects are primarily based on studies of consumer responses to changes in energy prices, but as shown by Greene for vehicles, this is different from consumer response to changes in energy efficiency. There is a need for a study on home weatherization that attempts to separate out price and rebound effects to see if they are similar or different. Rebound is probably higher for weatherization of low-income homes since prior to weatherization some of these households could not afford to keep their homes as warm as they would have liked. And rebound may be higher during shoulder periods where use of heating or cooling is optional.
We found that there are larger uncertainties about the size of indirect rebound effects and more careful studies are needed. From the evidence that is available, the most likely estimate is that indirect rebound effects are on the order of 11%, increasing both energy use and the level of economic activity. This 11% estimate comes from a study by Barker and Foxon that used a sophisticated macroeconomic model to examine the impact of a number of United Kingdom energy efficiency policies over the 2000-2010 period. The study estimated that indirect rebound was 11% by 2010, with higher effects (15%) in energy-intensive industries and lower effects for commerce (5%), road transport (6%), and households (10%). Unfortunately, there are no similar studies of the U.S., although such a study would be useful.
Other studies, using different methodologies, come up with different answers, both higher and lower. At the high end, a variety of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models have been used. However, such models are based upon a number of standard assumptions from neo-classical economics (perfect competition, constant returns to scale in production, consumers always work to maximize their utility) that are poorly supported by empirical evidence. In particular, the possibility of ”win-win” policies, such as those aimed at encouraging energy efficiency, cannot be fairly modeled if an economy is assumed to be at an optimal equilibrium, a key assumption of these models.
In conclusion, we found that there are both direct and indirect rebound effects, but these tend to be modest. Direct rebound effects are generally 10% or less. Indirect rebound effects are less well understood but the best available estimate is somewhere around 11%. These two types of rebound can be combined to estimate total rebound of about 20%. We examined claims of “backfire” (100% rebound), but they do not stand up to scrutiny. Furthermore, direct rebound effects can potentially be reduced through improved approaches to inform consumers about their energy use in ways that might influence their behavior. And indirect rebound effects, which appear to be linked to the share of our economy that goes to energy, may decline as the energy intensity of our economy decreases.
Overall, even if total rebound is about 20%, then 80% of the savings from energy efficiency programs and policies register in terms of reduced energy use, which benefits the environment and public health. And the 20% rebound contributes to increased consumer amenities (like more comfortable homes), as well as to a larger economy and more jobs. Therefore, these savings are not “lost,” but put to other generally beneficial uses.

U.S. Electricity Use is Declining and Energy Efficiency May be a Significant Factor;"U.S. electricity sales peaked in 2007 and have been declining modestly since then. Sales in 2012 were 1.9% lower than 2007 sales, and sales in the first ten months of 2013 are below the same period in 2012. While the economic recession is an obvious explanation for the decline in sales in 2008 and 2009, it is much less clear why sales have continued to decline since then, even as the economy began to recover. While some observers have attributed this stalled growth to the ongoing effects of the “Great Recession,” other observers suggest other factors may have played a role, such as erosion of manufacturing, more efficient buildings, lighting and appliances and increased use of on-site generation.
ACEEE has just completed an analysis on electricity-use trends since 1993 and we looked at changes in sales over the 2007-2012 period in particular. We found that no single factor can explain the change in electricity use over the 1993-2012 period. The factors that appear most significant were energy efficiency programs and policies, warmer weather, changes in gross domestic product (GDP), changes in electricity prices, and long-term trends.
Over the more recent period of 2007-2012, savings resulting from energy efficiency programs and policies, and from warmer winter weather, appear to be the most important contributors to declining electricity use in the residential and commercial sectors. This finding is consistent with the ramp-up of energy efficiency savings achieved from utility-sector energy efficiency programs, and from appliance and equipment efficiency standards that have taken effect since 2007. The other possible factors that we considered, such as GDP and electricity prices, did not change very much over the last six years and therefore do not appear to have had a significant effect on the recent decline in electricity use. The factors contributing to the decline in electricity use in the industrial sector are less clear but may include energy efficiency programs and policies as well.
Contribution of Each Variable to Change in Residential and Commercial Sector Per Capita Electricity Use Between 2007 and 2012
Note: Asterisked variables are statistically significant with 90% confidence in our regression analysis.
Further analysis and more data are needed to better understand the relative contribution of energy efficiency to declining electricity sales. In particular, we need to further examine what is occurring in the industrial sector. That analysis may need to wait for better industrial data to emerge, and for underlying trends in this sector to further manifest themselves as the sector recovers from the “Great Recession.”
The factors influencing electricity use are complex and difficult to boil down to a few key explanatory factors. For a variety of reasons we explain in the full paper, our results should be considered indicative, not definitive. It will be useful to update the analysis in a few years to see if the recent decline in electricity use, and the contribution of energy efficiency to this decline, continue. For example, if the recent cold winter weather continues, electricity for heating could be higher in 2014. Even so, our analysis suggests that energy efficiency has become an important factor in the level of U.S. electricity consumption.
